 Introduction


The Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him) was
expounding a recondite matter to us. His pale grey eyes shone and
twinkled, and his usually pale face was flushed and animated. The fire
burnt brightly, and the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the
lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our
glasses. Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and caressed us rather
than submitted to be sat upon, and there was that luxurious
after-dinner atmosphere, when thought runs gracefully free of the
trammels of precision. And he put it to us in this way—marking the
points with a lean forefinger—as we sat and lazily admired his
earnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it) and his fecundity.

“You must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert one or two
ideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry, for instance,
they taught you at school is founded on a misconception.”

“Is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?” said
Filby, an argumentative person with red hair.

“I do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable ground
for it. You will soon admit as much as I need from you. You know of
course that a mathematical line, a line of thickness _nil_, has no real
existence. They taught you that? Neither has a mathematical plane.
These things are mere abstractions.”

“That is all right,” said the Psychologist.

“Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have a
real existence.”

“There I object,” said Filby. “Of course a solid body may exist. All
real things—”

“So most people think. But wait a moment. Can an _instantaneous_ cube
exist?”

“Don’t follow you,” said Filby.

“Can a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a real
existence?”

Filby became pensive. “Clearly,” the Time Traveller proceeded, “any
real body must have extension in _four_ directions: it must have
Length, Breadth, Thickness, and—Duration. But through a natural
infirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in a moment, we
incline to overlook this fact. There are really four dimensions, three
which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time. There is,
however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former
three dimensions and the latter, because it happens that our
consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter
from the beginning to the end of our lives.”

“That,” said a very young man, making spasmodic efforts to relight his
cigar over the lamp; “that . . . very clear indeed.”

“Now, it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked,”
continued the Time Traveller, with a slight accession of cheerfulness.
“Really this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension, though some
people who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not know they mean it. It
is only another way of looking at Time. _There is no difference between
Time and any of the three dimensions of Space except that our
consciousness moves along it_. But some foolish people have got hold of
the wrong side of that idea. You have all heard what they have to say
about this Fourth Dimension?”

“_I_ have not,” said the Provincial Mayor.

“It is simply this. That Space, as our mathematicians have it, is
spoken of as having three dimensions, which one may call Length,
Breadth, and Thickness, and is always definable by reference to three
planes, each at right angles to the others. But some philosophical
people have been asking why _three_ dimensions particularly—why not
another direction at right angles to the other three?—and have even
tried to construct a Four-Dimensional geometry. Professor Simon Newcomb
was expounding this to the New York Mathematical Society only a month
or so ago. You know how on a flat surface, which has only two
dimensions, we can represent a figure of a three-dimensional solid, and
similarly they think that by models of three dimensions they could
represent one of four—if they could master the perspective of the
thing. See?”

“I think so,” murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, knitting his brows,
he lapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as one who
repeats mystic words. “Yes, I think I see it now,” he said after some
time, brightening in a quite transitory manner.

“Well, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this geometry
of Four Dimensions for some time. Some of my results are curious. For
instance, here is a portrait of a man at eight years old, another at
fifteen, another at seventeen, another at twenty-three, and so on. All
these are evidently sections, as it were, Three-Dimensional
representations of his Four-Dimensioned being, which is a fixed and
unalterable thing.

“Scientific people,” proceeded the Time Traveller, after the pause
required for the proper assimilation of this, “know very well that Time
is only a kind of Space. Here is a popular scientific diagram, a
weather record. This line I trace with my finger shows the movement of
the barometer. Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night it fell, then
this morning it rose again, and so gently upward to here. Surely the
mercury did not trace this line in any of the dimensions of Space
generally recognised? But certainly it traced such a line, and that
line, therefore, we must conclude, was along the Time-Dimension.”

“But,” said the Medical Man, staring hard at a coal in the fire, “if
Time is really only a fourth dimension of Space, why is it, and why has
it always been, regarded as something different? And why cannot we move
in Time as we move about in the other dimensions of Space?”

The Time Traveller smiled. “Are you so sure we can move freely in
Space? Right and left we can go, backward and forward freely enough,
and men always have done so. I admit we move freely in two dimensions.
But how about up and down? Gravitation limits us there.”

“Not exactly,” said the Medical Man. “There are balloons.”

“But before the balloons, save for spasmodic jumping and the
inequalities of the surface, man had no freedom of vertical movement.”

“Still they could move a little up and down,” said the Medical Man.

“Easier, far easier down than up.”

“And you cannot move at all in Time, you cannot get away from the
present moment.”

“My dear sir, that is just where you are wrong. That is just where the
whole world has gone wrong. We are always getting away from the present
moment. Our mental existences, which are immaterial and have no
dimensions, are passing along the Time-Dimension with a uniform
velocity from the cradle to the grave. Just as we should travel _down_
if we began our existence fifty miles above the earth’s surface.”

“But the great difficulty is this,” interrupted the Psychologist. ’You
_can_ move about in all directions of Space, but you cannot move about
in Time.”

“That is the germ of my great discovery. But you are wrong to say that
we cannot move about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling an
incident very vividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence: I
become absent-minded, as you say. I jump back for a moment. Of course
we have no means of staying back for any length of Time, any more than
a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the ground. But a
civilised man is better off than the savage in this respect. He can go
up against gravitation in a balloon, and why should he not hope that
ultimately he may be able to stop or accelerate his drift along the
Time-Dimension, or even turn about and travel the other way?”

“Oh, _this_,” began Filby, “is all—”

“Why not?” said the Time Traveller.

“It’s against reason,” said Filby.

“What reason?” said the Time Traveller.

“You can show black is white by argument,” said Filby, “but you will
never convince me.”

“Possibly not,” said the Time Traveller. “But now you begin to see the
object of my investigations into the geometry of Four Dimensions. Long
ago I had a vague inkling of a machine—”

“To travel through Time!” exclaimed the Very Young Man.

“That shall travel indifferently in any direction of Space and Time, as
the driver determines.”

Filby contented himself with laughter.

“But I have experimental verification,” said the Time Traveller.

“It would be remarkably convenient for the historian,” the Psychologist
suggested. “One might travel back and verify the accepted account of
the Battle of Hastings, for instance!”

“Don’t you think you would attract attention?” said the Medical Man.
“Our ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms.”

“One might get one’s Greek from the very lips of Homer and Plato,” the
Very Young Man thought.

“In which case they would certainly plough you for the Little-go. The
German scholars have improved Greek so much.”

“Then there is the future,” said the Very Young Man. “Just think! One
might invest all one’s money, leave it to accumulate at interest, and
hurry on ahead!”

“To discover a society,” said I, “erected on a strictly communistic
basis.”

“Of all the wild extravagant theories!” began the Psychologist.

“Yes, so it seemed to me, and so I never talked of it until—”

“Experimental verification!” cried I. “You are going to verify _that_?”

“The experiment!” cried Filby, who was getting brain-weary.

“Let’s see your experiment anyhow,” said the Psychologist, “though it’s
all humbug, you know.”

The Time Traveller smiled round at us. Then, still smiling faintly, and
with his hands deep in his trousers pockets, he walked slowly out of
the room, and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long passage to
his laboratory.

The Psychologist looked at us. “I wonder what he’s got?”

“Some sleight-of-hand trick or other,” said the Medical Man, and Filby
tried to tell us about a conjuror he had seen at Burslem, but before he
had finished his preface the Time Traveller came back, and Filby’s
anecdote collapsed.




 II.
 The Machine


The thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering metallic
framework, scarcely larger than a small clock, and very delicately
made. There was ivory in it, and some transparent crystalline
substance. And now I must be explicit, for this that follows—unless his
explanation is to be accepted—is an absolutely unaccountable thing. He
took one of the small octagonal tables that were scattered about the
room, and set it in front of the fire, with two legs on the hearthrug.
On this table he placed the mechanism. Then he drew up a chair, and sat
down. The only other object on the table was a small shaded lamp, the
bright light of which fell upon the model. There were also perhaps a
dozen candles about, two in brass candlesticks upon the mantel and
several in sconces, so that the room was brilliantly illuminated. I sat
in a low arm-chair nearest the fire, and I drew this forward so as to
be almost between the Time Traveller and the fireplace. Filby sat
behind him, looking over his shoulder. The Medical Man and the
Provincial Mayor watched him in profile from the right, the
Psychologist from the left. The Very Young Man stood behind the
Psychologist. We were all on the alert. It appears incredible to me
that any kind of trick, however subtly conceived and however adroitly
done, could have been played upon us under these conditions.

The Time Traveller looked at us, and then at the mechanism. “Well?”
said the Psychologist.

“This little affair,” said the Time Traveller, resting his elbows upon
the table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus, “is only
a model. It is my plan for a machine to travel through time. You will
notice that it looks singularly askew, and that there is an odd
twinkling appearance about this bar, as though it was in some way
unreal.” He pointed to the part with his finger. “Also, here is one
little white lever, and here is another.”

The Medical Man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing.
“It’s beautifully made,” he said.

“It took two years to make,” retorted the Time Traveller. Then, when we
had all imitated the action of the Medical Man, he said: “Now I want
you clearly to understand that this lever, being pressed over, sends
the machine gliding into the future, and this other reverses the
motion. This saddle represents the seat of a time traveller. Presently
I am going to press the lever, and off the machine will go. It will
vanish, pass into future Time, and disappear. Have a good look at the
thing. Look at the table too, and satisfy yourselves there is no
trickery. I don’t want to waste this model, and then be told I’m a
quack.”

There was a minute’s pause perhaps. The Psychologist seemed about to
speak to me, but changed his mind. Then the Time Traveller put forth
his finger towards the lever. “No,” he said suddenly. “Lend me your
hand.” And turning to the Psychologist, he took that individual’s hand
in his own and told him to put out his forefinger. So that it was the
Psychologist himself who sent forth the model Time Machine on its
interminable voyage. We all saw the lever turn. I am absolutely certain
there was no trickery. There was a breath of wind, and the lamp flame
jumped. One of the candles on the mantel was blown out, and the little
machine suddenly swung round, became indistinct, was seen as a ghost
for a second perhaps, as an eddy of faintly glittering brass and ivory;
and it was gone—vanished! Save for the lamp the table was bare.

Everyone was silent for a minute. Then Filby said he was damned.

The Psychologist recovered from his stupor, and suddenly looked under
the table. At that the Time Traveller laughed cheerfully. “Well?” he
said, with a reminiscence of the Psychologist. Then, getting up, he
went to the tobacco jar on the mantel, and with his back to us began to
fill his pipe.

We stared at each other. “Look here,” said the Medical Man, “are you in
earnest about this? Do you seriously believe that that machine has
travelled into time?”

“Certainly,” said the Time Traveller, stooping to light a spill at the
fire. Then he turned, lighting his pipe, to look at the Psychologist’s
face. (The Psychologist, to show that he was not unhinged, helped
himself to a cigar and tried to light it uncut.) “What is more, I have
a big machine nearly finished in there”—he indicated the
laboratory—“and when that is put together I mean to have a journey on
my own account.”

“You mean to say that that machine has travelled into the future?” said
Filby.

“Into the future or the past—I don’t, for certain, know which.”

After an interval the Psychologist had an inspiration. “It must have
gone into the past if it has gone anywhere,” he said.

“Why?” said the Time Traveller.

“Because I presume that it has not moved in space, and if it travelled
into the future it would still be here all this time, since it must
have travelled through this time.”

“But,” said I, “If it travelled into the past it would have been
visible when we came first into this room; and last Thursday when we
were here; and the Thursday before that; and so forth!”

“Serious objections,” remarked the Provincial Mayor, with an air of
impartiality, turning towards the Time Traveller.

“Not a bit,” said the Time Traveller, and, to the Psychologist: “You
think. _You_ can explain that. It’s presentation below the threshold,
you know, diluted presentation.”

“Of course,” said the Psychologist, and reassured us. “That’s a simple
point of psychology. I should have thought of it. It’s plain enough,
and helps the paradox delightfully. We cannot see it, nor can we
appreciate this machine, any more than we can the spoke of a wheel
spinning, or a bullet flying through the air. If it is travelling
through time fifty times or a hundred times faster than we are, if it
gets through a minute while we get through a second, the impression it
creates will of course be only one-fiftieth or one-hundredth of what it
would make if it were not travelling in time. That’s plain enough.” He
passed his hand through the space in which the machine had been. “You
see?” he said, laughing.

We sat and stared at the vacant table for a minute or so. Then the Time
Traveller asked us what we thought of it all.

“It sounds plausible enough tonight,” said the Medical Man; “but wait
until tomorrow. Wait for the common sense of the morning.”

“Would you like to see the Time Machine itself?” asked the Time
Traveller. And therewith, taking the lamp in his hand, he led the way
down the long, draughty corridor to his laboratory. I remember vividly
the flickering light, his queer, broad head in silhouette, the dance of
the shadows, how we all followed him, puzzled but incredulous, and how
there in the laboratory we beheld a larger edition of the little
mechanism which we had seen vanish from before our eyes. Parts were of
nickel, parts of ivory, parts had certainly been filed or sawn out of
rock crystal. The thing was generally complete, but the twisted
crystalline bars lay unfinished upon the bench beside some sheets of
drawings, and I took one up for a better look at it. Quartz it seemed
to be.

“Look here,” said the Medical Man, “are you perfectly serious? Or is
this a trick—like that ghost you showed us last Christmas?”

“Upon that machine,” said the Time Traveller, holding the lamp aloft,
“I intend to explore time. Is that plain? I was never more serious in
my life.”

None of us quite knew how to take it.

I caught Filby’s eye over the shoulder of the Medical Man, and he
winked at me solemnly.




 III.
 The Time Traveller Returns


I think that at that time none of us quite believed in the Time
Machine. The fact is, the Time Traveller was one of those men who are
too clever to be believed: you never felt that you saw all round him;
you always suspected some subtle reserve, some ingenuity in ambush,
behind his lucid frankness. Had Filby shown the model and explained the
matter in the Time Traveller’s words, we should have shown _him_ far
less scepticism. For we should have perceived his motives: a
pork-butcher could understand Filby. But the Time Traveller had more
than a touch of whim among his elements, and we distrusted him. Things
that would have made the fame of a less clever man seemed tricks in his
hands. It is a mistake to do things too easily. The serious people who
took him seriously never felt quite sure of his deportment; they were
somehow aware that trusting their reputations for judgment with him was
like furnishing a nursery with eggshell china. So I don’t think any of
us said very much about time travelling in the interval between that
Thursday and the next, though its odd potentialities ran, no doubt, in
most of our minds: its plausibility, that is, its practical
incredibleness, the curious possibilities of anachronism and of utter
confusion it suggested. For my own part, I was particularly preoccupied
with the trick of the model. That I remember discussing with the
Medical Man, whom I met on Friday at the Linnæan. He said he had seen a
similar thing at Tübingen, and laid considerable stress on the
blowing-out of the candle. But how the trick was done he could not
explain.

The next Thursday I went again to Richmond—I suppose I was one of the
Time Traveller’s most constant guests—and, arriving late, found four or
five men already assembled in his drawing-room. The Medical Man was
standing before the fire with a sheet of paper in one hand and his
watch in the other. I looked round for the Time Traveller, and—“It’s
half-past seven now,” said the Medical Man. “I suppose we’d better have
dinner?”

“Where’s——?” said I, naming our host.

“You’ve just come? It’s rather odd. He’s unavoidably detained. He asks
me in this note to lead off with dinner at seven if he’s not back. Says
he’ll explain when he comes.”

“It seems a pity to let the dinner spoil,” said the Editor of a
well-known daily paper; and thereupon the Doctor rang the bell.

The Psychologist was the only person besides the Doctor and myself who
had attended the previous dinner. The other men were Blank, the Editor
aforementioned, a certain journalist, and another—a quiet, shy man with
a beard—whom I didn’t know, and who, as far as my observation went,
never opened his mouth all the evening. There was some speculation at
the dinner-table about the Time Traveller’s absence, and I suggested
time travelling, in a half-jocular spirit. The Editor wanted that
explained to him, and the Psychologist volunteered a wooden account of
the “ingenious paradox and trick” we had witnessed that day week. He
was in the midst of his exposition when the door from the corridor
opened slowly and without noise. I was facing the door, and saw it
first. “Hallo!” I said. “At last!” And the door opened wider, and the
Time Traveller stood before us. I gave a cry of surprise. “Good
heavens! man, what’s the matter?” cried the Medical Man, who saw him
next. And the whole tableful turned towards the door.

He was in an amazing plight. His coat was dusty and dirty, and smeared
with green down the sleeves; his hair disordered, and as it seemed to
me greyer—either with dust and dirt or because its colour had actually
faded. His face was ghastly pale; his chin had a brown cut on it—a cut
half-healed; his expression was haggard and drawn, as by intense
suffering. For a moment he hesitated in the doorway, as if he had been
dazzled by the light. Then he came into the room. He walked with just
such a limp as I have seen in footsore tramps. We stared at him in
silence, expecting him to speak.

He said not a word, but came painfully to the table, and made a motion
towards the wine. The Editor filled a glass of champagne, and pushed it
towards him. He drained it, and it seemed to do him good: for he looked
round the table, and the ghost of his old smile flickered across his
face. “What on earth have you been up to, man?” said the Doctor. The
Time Traveller did not seem to hear. “Don’t let me disturb you,” he
said, with a certain faltering articulation. “I’m all right.” He
stopped, held out his glass for more, and took it off at a draught.
“That’s good,” he said. His eyes grew brighter, and a faint colour came
into his cheeks. His glance flickered over our faces with a certain
dull approval, and then went round the warm and comfortable room. Then
he spoke again, still as it were feeling his way among his words. “I’m
going to wash and dress, and then I’ll come down and explain things....
Save me some of that mutton. I’m starving for a bit of meat.”

He looked across at the Editor, who was a rare visitor, and hoped he
was all right. The Editor began a question. “Tell you presently,” said
the Time Traveller. “I’m—funny! Be all right in a minute.”

He put down his glass, and walked towards the staircase door. Again I
remarked his lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall, and
standing up in my place, I saw his feet as he went out. He had nothing
on them but a pair of tattered, blood-stained socks. Then the door
closed upon him. I had half a mind to follow, till I remembered how he
detested any fuss about himself. For a minute, perhaps, my mind was
wool-gathering. Then, “Remarkable Behaviour of an Eminent Scientist,” I
heard the Editor say, thinking (after his wont) in headlines. And this
brought my attention back to the bright dinner-table.

“What’s the game?” said the Journalist. “Has he been doing the Amateur
Cadger? I don’t follow.” I met the eye of the Psychologist, and read my
own interpretation in his face. I thought of the Time Traveller limping
painfully upstairs. I don’t think anyone else had noticed his lameness.

The first to recover completely from this surprise was the Medical Man,
who rang the bell—the Time Traveller hated to have servants waiting at
dinner—for a hot plate. At that the Editor turned to his knife and fork
with a grunt, and the Silent Man followed suit. The dinner was resumed.
Conversation was exclamatory for a little while with gaps of
wonderment; and then the Editor got fervent in his curiosity. “Does our
friend eke out his modest income with a crossing? or has he his
Nebuchadnezzar phases?” he inquired. “I feel assured it’s this business
of the Time Machine,” I said, and took up the Psychologist’s account of
our previous meeting. The new guests were frankly incredulous. The
Editor raised objections. “What _was_ this time travelling? A man
couldn’t cover himself with dust by rolling in a paradox, could he?”
And then, as the idea came home to him, he resorted to caricature.
Hadn’t they any clothes-brushes in the Future? The Journalist too,
would not believe at any price, and joined the Editor in the easy work
of heaping ridicule on the whole thing. They were both the new kind of
journalist—very joyous, irreverent young men. “Our Special
Correspondent in the Day after Tomorrow reports,” the Journalist was
saying—or rather shouting—when the Time Traveller came back. He was
dressed in ordinary evening clothes, and nothing save his haggard look
remained of the change that had startled me.

“I say,” said the Editor hilariously, “these chaps here say you have
been travelling into the middle of next week! Tell us all about little
Rosebery, will you? What will you take for the lot?”

The Time Traveller came to the place reserved for him without a word.
He smiled quietly, in his old way. “Where’s my mutton?” he said. “What
a treat it is to stick a fork into meat again!”

“Story!” cried the Editor.

“Story be damned!” said the Time Traveller. “I want something to eat. I
won’t say a word until I get some peptone into my arteries. Thanks. And
the salt.”

“One word,” said I. “Have you been time travelling?”

“Yes,” said the Time Traveller, with his mouth full, nodding his head.

“I’d give a shilling a line for a verbatim note,” said the Editor. The
Time Traveller pushed his glass towards the Silent Man and rang it with
his fingernail; at which the Silent Man, who had been staring at his
face, started convulsively, and poured him wine. The rest of the dinner
was uncomfortable. For my own part, sudden questions kept on rising to
my lips, and I dare say it was the same with the others. The Journalist
tried to relieve the tension by telling anecdotes of Hettie Potter. The
Time Traveller devoted his attention to his dinner, and displayed the
appetite of a tramp. The Medical Man smoked a cigarette, and watched
the Time Traveller through his eyelashes. The Silent Man seemed even
more clumsy than usual, and drank champagne with regularity and
determination out of sheer nervousness. At last the Time Traveller
pushed his plate away, and looked round us. “I suppose I must
apologise,” he said. “I was simply starving. I’ve had a most amazing
time.” He reached out his hand for a cigar, and cut the end. “But come
into the smoking-room. It’s too long a story to tell over greasy
plates.” And ringing the bell in passing, he led the way into the
adjoining room.

“You have told Blank, and Dash, and Chose about the machine?” he said
to me, leaning back in his easy-chair and naming the three new guests.

“But the thing’s a mere paradox,” said the Editor.

“I can’t argue tonight. I don’t mind telling you the story, but I can’t
argue. I will,” he went on, “tell you the story of what has happened to
me, if you like, but you must refrain from interruptions. I want to
tell it. Badly. Most of it will sound like lying. So be it! It’s
true—every word of it, all the same. I was in my laboratory at four
o’clock, and since then … I’ve lived eight days … such days as no human
being ever lived before! I’m nearly worn out, but I shan’t sleep till
I’ve told this thing over to you. Then I shall go to bed. But no
interruptions! Is it agreed?”

“Agreed,” said the Editor, and the rest of us echoed “Agreed.” And with
that the Time Traveller began his story as I have set it forth. He sat
back in his chair at first, and spoke like a weary man. Afterwards he
got more animated. In writing it down I feel with only too much
keenness the inadequacy of pen and ink—and, above all, my own
inadequacy—to express its quality. You read, I will suppose,
attentively enough; but you cannot see the speaker’s white, sincere
face in the bright circle of the little lamp, nor hear the intonation
of his voice. You cannot know how his expression followed the turns of
his story! Most of us hearers were in shadow, for the candles in the
smoking-room had not been lighted, and only the face of the Journalist
and the legs of the Silent Man from the knees downward were
illuminated. At first we glanced now and again at each other. After a
time we ceased to do that, and looked only at the Time Traveller’s
face.




 IV.
 Time Travelling


“I told some of you last Thursday of the principles of the Time
Machine, and showed you the actual thing itself, incomplete in the
workshop. There it is now, a little travel-worn, truly; and one of the
ivory bars is cracked, and a brass rail bent; but the rest of it’s
sound enough. I expected to finish it on Friday; but on Friday, when
the putting together was nearly done, I found that one of the nickel
bars was exactly one inch too short, and this I had to get remade; so
that the thing was not complete until this morning. It was at ten
o’clock today that the first of all Time Machines began its career. I
gave it a last tap, tried all the screws again, put one more drop of
oil on the quartz rod, and sat myself in the saddle. I suppose a
suicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels much the same wonder at
what will come next as I felt then. I took the starting lever in one
hand and the stopping one in the other, pressed the first, and almost
immediately the second. I seemed to reel; I felt a nightmare sensation
of falling; and, looking round, I saw the laboratory exactly as before.
Had anything happened? For a moment I suspected that my intellect had
tricked me. Then I noted the clock. A moment before, as it seemed, it
had stood at a minute or so past ten; now it was nearly half-past
three!

“I drew a breath, set my teeth, gripped the starting lever with both
hands, and went off with a thud. The laboratory got hazy and went dark.
Mrs. Watchett came in and walked, apparently without seeing me, towards
the garden door. I suppose it took her a minute or so to traverse the
place, but to me she seemed to shoot across the room like a rocket. I
pressed the lever over to its extreme position. The night came like the
turning out of a lamp, and in another moment came tomorrow. The
laboratory grew faint and hazy, then fainter and ever fainter. Tomorrow
night came black, then day again, night again, day again, faster and
faster still. An eddying murmur filled my ears, and a strange, dumb
confusedness descended on my mind.

“I am afraid I cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time
travelling. They are excessively unpleasant. There is a feeling exactly
like that one has upon a switchback—of a helpless headlong motion! I
felt the same horrible anticipation, too, of an imminent smash. As I
put on pace, night followed day like the flapping of a black wing. The
dim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to fall away from me,
and I saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky, leaping it every
minute, and every minute marking a day. I supposed the laboratory had
been destroyed and I had come into the open air. I had a dim impression
of scaffolding, but I was already going too fast to be conscious of any
moving things. The slowest snail that ever crawled dashed by too fast
for me. The twinkling succession of darkness and light was excessively
painful to the eye. Then, in the intermittent darknesses, I saw the
moon spinning swiftly through her quarters from new to full, and had a
faint glimpse of the circling stars. Presently, as I went on, still
gaining velocity, the palpitation of night and day merged into one
continuous greyness; the sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue, a
splendid luminous colour like that of early twilight; the jerking sun
became a streak of fire, a brilliant arch, in space; the moon a fainter
fluctuating band; and I could see nothing of the stars, save now and
then a brighter circle flickering in the blue.

“The landscape was misty and vague. I was still on the hillside upon
which this house now stands, and the shoulder rose above me grey and
dim. I saw trees growing and changing like puffs of vapour, now brown,
now green; they grew, spread, shivered, and passed away. I saw huge
buildings rise up faint and fair, and pass like dreams. The whole
surface of the earth seemed changed—melting and flowing under my eyes.
The little hands upon the dials that registered my speed raced round
faster and faster. Presently I noted that the sun belt swayed up and
down, from solstice to solstice, in a minute or less, and that
consequently my pace was over a year a minute; and minute by minute the
white snow flashed across the world, and vanished, and was followed by
the bright, brief green of spring.

“The unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now. They
merged at last into a kind of hysterical exhilaration. I remarked,
indeed, a clumsy swaying of the machine, for which I was unable to
account. But my mind was too confused to attend to it, so with a kind
of madness growing upon me, I flung myself into futurity. At first I
scarce thought of stopping, scarce thought of anything but these new
sensations. But presently a fresh series of impressions grew up in my
mind—a certain curiosity and therewith a certain dread—until at last
they took complete possession of me. What strange developments of
humanity, what wonderful advances upon our rudimentary civilisation, I
thought, might not appear when I came to look nearly into the dim
elusive world that raced and fluctuated before my eyes! I saw great and
splendid architecture rising about me, more massive than any buildings
of our own time, and yet, as it seemed, built of glimmer and mist. I
saw a richer green flow up the hillside, and remain there, without any
wintry intermission. Even through the veil of my confusion the earth
seemed very fair. And so my mind came round to the business of
stopping.

“The peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding some substance
in the space which I, or the machine, occupied. So long as I travelled
at a high velocity through time, this scarcely mattered: I was, so to
speak, attenuated—was slipping like a vapour through the interstices of
intervening substances! But to come to a stop involved the jamming of
myself, molecule by molecule, into whatever lay in my way; meant
bringing my atoms into such intimate contact with those of the obstacle
that a profound chemical reaction—possibly a far-reaching
explosion—would result, and blow myself and my apparatus out of all
possible dimensions—into the Unknown. This possibility had occurred to
me again and again while I was making the machine; but then I had
cheerfully accepted it as an unavoidable risk—one of the risks a man
has got to take! Now the risk was inevitable, I no longer saw it in the
same cheerful light. The fact is that, insensibly, the absolute
strangeness of everything, the sickly jarring and swaying of the
machine, above all, the feeling of prolonged falling, had absolutely
upset my nerves. I told myself that I could never stop, and with a gust
of petulance I resolved to stop forthwith. Like an impatient fool, I
lugged over the lever, and incontinently the thing went reeling over,
and I was flung headlong through the air.

“There was the sound of a clap of thunder in my ears. I may have been
stunned for a moment. A pitiless hail was hissing round me, and I was
sitting on soft turf in front of the overset machine. Everything still
seemed grey, but presently I remarked that the confusion in my ears was
gone. I looked round me. I was on what seemed to be a little lawn in a
garden, surrounded by rhododendron bushes, and I noticed that their
mauve and purple blossoms were dropping in a shower under the beating
of the hailstones. The rebounding, dancing hail hung in a little cloud
over the machine, and drove along the ground like smoke. In a moment I
was wet to the skin. ‘Fine hospitality,’ said I, ‘to a man who has
travelled innumerable years to see you.’

“Presently I thought what a fool I was to get wet. I stood up and
looked round me. A colossal figure, carved apparently in some white
stone, loomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the hazy
downpour. But all else of the world was invisible.

“My sensations would be hard to describe. As the columns of hail grew
thinner, I saw the white figure more distinctly. It was very large, for
a silver birch-tree touched its shoulder. It was of white marble, in
shape something like a winged sphinx, but the wings, instead of being
carried vertically at the sides, were spread so that it seemed to
hover. The pedestal, it appeared to me, was of bronze, and was thick
with verdigris. It chanced that the face was towards me; the sightless
eyes seemed to watch me; there was the faint shadow of a smile on the
lips. It was greatly weather-worn, and that imparted an unpleasant
suggestion of disease. I stood looking at it for a little space—half a
minute, perhaps, or half an hour. It seemed to advance and to recede as
the hail drove before it denser or thinner. At last I tore my eyes from
it for a moment, and saw that the hail curtain had worn threadbare, and
that the sky was lightening with the promise of the sun.

“I looked up again at the crouching white shape, and the full temerity
of my voyage came suddenly upon me. What might appear when that hazy
curtain was altogether withdrawn? What might not have happened to men?
What if cruelty had grown into a common passion? What if in this
interval the race had lost its manliness, and had developed into
something inhuman, unsympathetic, and overwhelmingly powerful? I might
seem some old-world savage animal, only the more dreadful and
disgusting for our common likeness—a foul creature to be incontinently
slain.

“Already I saw other vast shapes—huge buildings with intricate parapets
and tall columns, with a wooded hillside dimly creeping in upon me
through the lessening storm. I was seized with a panic fear. I turned
frantically to the Time Machine, and strove hard to readjust it. As I
did so the shafts of the sun smote through the thunderstorm. The grey
downpour was swept aside and vanished like the trailing garments of a
ghost. Above me, in the intense blue of the summer sky, some faint
brown shreds of cloud whirled into nothingness. The great buildings
about me stood out clear and distinct, shining with the wet of the
thunderstorm, and picked out in white by the unmelted hailstones piled
along their courses. I felt naked in a strange world. I felt as perhaps
a bird may feel in the clear air, knowing the hawk wings above and will
swoop. My fear grew to frenzy. I took a breathing space, set my teeth,
and again grappled fiercely, wrist and knee, with the machine. It gave
under my desperate onset and turned over. It struck my chin violently.
One hand on the saddle, the other on the lever, I stood panting heavily
in attitude to mount again.

“But with this recovery of a prompt retreat my courage recovered. I
looked more curiously and less fearfully at this world of the remote
future. In a circular opening, high up in the wall of the nearer house,
I saw a group of figures clad in rich soft robes. They had seen me, and
their faces were directed towards me.

“Then I heard voices approaching me. Coming through the bushes by the
White Sphinx were the heads and shoulders of men running. One of these
emerged in a pathway leading straight to the little lawn upon which I
stood with my machine. He was a slight creature—perhaps four feet
high—clad in a purple tunic, girdled at the waist with a leather belt.
Sandals or buskins—I could not clearly distinguish which—were on his
feet; his legs were bare to the knees, and his head was bare. Noticing
that, I noticed for the first time how warm the air was.

“He struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature, but
indescribably frail. His flushed face reminded me of the more beautiful
kind of consumptive—that hectic beauty of which we used to hear so
much. At the sight of him I suddenly regained confidence. I took my
hands from the machine.




 V.
 In the Golden Age


“In another moment we were standing face to face, I and this fragile
thing out of futurity. He came straight up to me and laughed into my
eyes. The absence from his bearing of any sign of fear struck me at
once. Then he turned to the two others who were following him and spoke
to them in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongue.

“There were others coming, and presently a little group of perhaps
eight or ten of these exquisite creatures were about me. One of them
addressed me. It came into my head, oddly enough, that my voice was too
harsh and deep for them. So I shook my head, and, pointing to my ears,
shook it again. He came a step forward, hesitated, and then touched my
hand. Then I felt other soft little tentacles upon my back and
shoulders. They wanted to make sure I was real. There was nothing in
this at all alarming. Indeed, there was something in these pretty
little people that inspired confidence—a graceful gentleness, a certain
childlike ease. And besides, they looked so frail that I could fancy
myself flinging the whole dozen of them about like ninepins. But I made
a sudden motion to warn them when I saw their little pink hands feeling
at the Time Machine. Happily then, when it was not too late, I thought
of a danger I had hitherto forgotten, and reaching over the bars of the
machine I unscrewed the little levers that would set it in motion, and
put these in my pocket. Then I turned again to see what I could do in
the way of communication.

“And then, looking more nearly into their features, I saw some further
peculiarities in their Dresden china type of prettiness. Their hair,
which was uniformly curly, came to a sharp end at the neck and cheek;
there was not the faintest suggestion of it on the face, and their ears
were singularly minute. The mouths were small, with bright red, rather
thin lips, and the little chins ran to a point. The eyes were large and
mild; and—this may seem egotism on my part—I fancied even that there
was a certain lack of the interest I might have expected in them.

“As they made no effort to communicate with me, but simply stood round
me smiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other, I began the
conversation. I pointed to the Time Machine and to myself. Then,
hesitating for a moment how to express Time, I pointed to the sun. At
once a quaintly pretty little figure in chequered purple and white
followed my gesture, and then astonished me by imitating the sound of
thunder.

“For a moment I was staggered, though the import of his gesture was
plain enough. The question had come into my mind abruptly: were these
creatures fools? You may hardly understand how it took me. You see, I
had always anticipated that the people of the year Eight Hundred and
Two Thousand odd would be incredibly in front of us in knowledge, art,
everything. Then one of them suddenly asked me a question that showed
him to be on the intellectual level of one of our five-year-old
children—asked me, in fact, if I had come from the sun in a
thunderstorm! It let loose the judgment I had suspended upon their
clothes, their frail light limbs, and fragile features. A flow of
disappointment rushed across my mind. For a moment I felt that I had
built the Time Machine in vain.

“I nodded, pointed to the sun, and gave them such a vivid rendering of
a thunderclap as startled them. They all withdrew a pace or so and
bowed. Then came one laughing towards me, carrying a chain of beautiful
flowers altogether new to me, and put it about my neck. The idea was
received with melodious applause; and presently they were all running
to and fro for flowers, and laughingly flinging them upon me until I
was almost smothered with blossom. You who have never seen the like can
scarcely imagine what delicate and wonderful flowers countless years of
culture had created. Then someone suggested that their plaything should
be exhibited in the nearest building, and so I was led past the sphinx
of white marble, which had seemed to watch me all the while with a
smile at my astonishment, towards a vast grey edifice of fretted stone.
As I went with them the memory of my confident anticipations of a
profoundly grave and intellectual posterity came, with irresistible
merriment, to my mind.

“The building had a huge entry, and was altogether of colossal
dimensions. I was naturally most occupied with the growing crowd of
little people, and with the big open portals that yawned before me
shadowy and mysterious. My general impression of the world I saw over
their heads was a tangled waste of beautiful bushes and flowers, a long
neglected and yet weedless garden. I saw a number of tall spikes of
strange white flowers, measuring a foot perhaps across the spread of
the waxen petals. They grew scattered, as if wild, among the variegated
shrubs, but, as I say, I did not examine them closely at this time. The
Time Machine was left deserted on the turf among the rhododendrons.

“The arch of the doorway was richly carved, but naturally I did not
observe the carving very narrowly, though I fancied I saw suggestions
of old Phœnician decorations as I passed through, and it struck me that
they were very badly broken and weather-worn. Several more brightly
clad people met me in the doorway, and so we entered, I, dressed in
dingy nineteenth-century garments, looking grotesque enough, garlanded
with flowers, and surrounded by an eddying mass of bright,
soft-coloured robes and shining white limbs, in a melodious whirl of
laughter and laughing speech.

“The big doorway opened into a proportionately great hall hung with
brown. The roof was in shadow, and the windows, partially glazed with
coloured glass and partially unglazed, admitted a tempered light. The
floor was made up of huge blocks of some very hard white metal, not
plates nor slabs—blocks, and it was so much worn, as I judged by the
going to and fro of past generations, as to be deeply channelled along
the more frequented ways. Transverse to the length were innumerable
tables made of slabs of polished stone, raised, perhaps, a foot from
the floor, and upon these were heaps of fruits. Some I recognised as a
kind of hypertrophied raspberry and orange, but for the most part they
were strange.

“Between the tables was scattered a great number of cushions. Upon
these my conductors seated themselves, signing for me to do likewise.
With a pretty absence of ceremony they began to eat the fruit with
their hands, flinging peel and stalks, and so forth, into the round
openings in the sides of the tables. I was not loath to follow their
example, for I felt thirsty and hungry. As I did so I surveyed the hall
at my leisure.

“And perhaps the thing that struck me most was its dilapidated look.
The stained-glass windows, which displayed only a geometrical pattern,
were broken in many places, and the curtains that hung across the lower
end were thick with dust. And it caught my eye that the corner of the
marble table near me was fractured. Nevertheless, the general effect
was extremely rich and picturesque. There were, perhaps, a couple of
hundred people dining in the hall, and most of them, seated as near to
me as they could come, were watching me with interest, their little
eyes shining over the fruit they were eating. All were clad in the same
soft, and yet strong, silky material.

“Fruit, by the bye, was all their diet. These people of the remote
future were strict vegetarians, and while I was with them, in spite of
some carnal cravings, I had to be frugivorous also. Indeed, I found
afterwards that horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, had followed the
Ichthyosaurus into extinction. But the fruits were very delightful;
one, in particular, that seemed to be in season all the time I was
there—a floury thing in a three-sided husk—was especially good, and I
made it my staple. At first I was puzzled by all these strange fruits,
and by the strange flowers I saw, but later I began to perceive their
import.

“However, I am telling you of my fruit dinner in the distant future
now. So soon as my appetite was a little checked, I determined to make
a resolute attempt to learn the speech of these new men of mine.
Clearly that was the next thing to do. The fruits seemed a convenient
thing to begin upon, and holding one of these up I began a series of
interrogative sounds and gestures. I had some considerable difficulty
in conveying my meaning. At first my efforts met with a stare of
surprise or inextinguishable laughter, but presently a fair-haired
little creature seemed to grasp my intention and repeated a name. They
had to chatter and explain the business at great length to each other,
and my first attempts to make the exquisite little sounds of their
language caused an immense amount of genuine, if uncivil, amusement.
However, I felt like a schoolmaster amidst children, and persisted, and
presently I had a score of noun substantives at least at my command;
and then I got to demonstrative pronouns, and even the verb ‘to eat.’
But it was slow work, and the little people soon tired and wanted to
get away from my interrogations, so I determined, rather of necessity,
to let them give their lessons in little doses when they felt inclined.
And very little doses I found they were before long, for I never met
people more indolent or more easily fatigued.




 VI.
 The Sunset of Mankind


“A queer thing I soon discovered about my little hosts, and that was
their lack of interest. They would come to me with eager cries of
astonishment, like children, but, like children they would soon stop
examining me, and wander away after some other toy. The dinner and my
conversational beginnings ended, I noted for the first time that almost
all those who had surrounded me at first were gone. It is odd, too, how
speedily I came to disregard these little people. I went out through
the portal into the sunlit world again as soon as my hunger was
satisfied. I was continually meeting more of these men of the future,
who would follow me a little distance, chatter and laugh about me, and,
having smiled and gesticulated in a friendly way, leave me again to my
own devices.

“The calm of evening was upon the world as I emerged from the great
hall, and the scene was lit by the warm glow of the setting sun. At
first things were very confusing. Everything was so entirely different
from the world I had known—even the flowers. The big building I had
left was situated on the slope of a broad river valley, but the Thames
had shifted, perhaps, a mile from its present position. I resolved to
mount to the summit of a crest, perhaps a mile and a half away, from
which I could get a wider view of this our planet in the year Eight
Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred and One, A.D. For that, I should
explain, was the date the little dials of my machine recorded.

“As I walked I was watching for every impression that could possibly
help to explain the condition of ruinous splendour in which I found the
world—for ruinous it was. A little way up the hill, for instance, was a
great heap of granite, bound together by masses of aluminium, a vast
labyrinth of precipitous walls and crumpled heaps, amidst which were
thick heaps of very beautiful pagoda-like plants—nettles possibly—but
wonderfully tinted with brown about the leaves, and incapable of
stinging. It was evidently the derelict remains of some vast structure,
to what end built I could not determine. It was here that I was
destined, at a later date, to have a very strange experience—the first
intimation of a still stranger discovery—but of that I will speak in
its proper place.

“Looking round, with a sudden thought, from a terrace on which I rested
for a while, I realised that there were no small houses to be seen.
Apparently the single house, and possibly even the household, had
vanished. Here and there among the greenery were palace-like buildings,
but the house and the cottage, which form such characteristic features
of our own English landscape, had disappeared.

“‘Communism,’ said I to myself.

“And on the heels of that came another thought. I looked at the
half-dozen little figures that were following me. Then, in a flash, I
perceived that all had the same form of costume, the same soft hairless
visage, and the same girlish rotundity of limb. It may seem strange,
perhaps, that I had not noticed this before. But everything was so
strange. Now, I saw the fact plainly enough. In costume, and in all the
differences of texture and bearing that now mark off the sexes from
each other, these people of the future were alike. And the children
seemed to my eyes to be but the miniatures of their parents. I judged
then that the children of that time were extremely precocious,
physically at least, and I found afterwards abundant verification of my
opinion.

“Seeing the ease and security in which these people were living, I felt
that this close resemblance of the sexes was after all what one would
expect; for the strength of a man and the softness of a woman, the
institution of the family, and the differentiation of occupations are
mere militant necessities of an age of physical force. Where population
is balanced and abundant, much childbearing becomes an evil rather than
a blessing to the State; where violence comes but rarely and offspring
are secure, there is less necessity—indeed there is no necessity—for an
efficient family, and the specialisation of the sexes with reference to
their children’s needs disappears. We see some beginnings of this even
in our own time, and in this future age it was complete. This, I must
remind you, was my speculation at the time. Later, I was to appreciate
how far it fell short of the reality.

“While I was musing upon these things, my attention was attracted by a
pretty little structure, like a well under a cupola. I thought in a
transitory way of the oddness of wells still existing, and then resumed
the thread of my speculations. There were no large buildings towards
the top of the hill, and as my walking powers were evidently
miraculous, I was presently left alone for the first time. With a
strange sense of freedom and adventure I pushed on up to the crest.

“There I found a seat of some yellow metal that I did not recognise,
corroded in places with a kind of pinkish rust and half smothered in
soft moss, the arm-rests cast and filed into the resemblance of
griffins’ heads. I sat down on it, and I surveyed the broad view of our
old world under the sunset of that long day. It was as sweet and fair a
view as I have ever seen. The sun had already gone below the horizon
and the west was flaming gold, touched with some horizontal bars of
purple and crimson. Below was the valley of the Thames, in which the
river lay like a band of burnished steel. I have already spoken of the
great palaces dotted about among the variegated greenery, some in ruins
and some still occupied. Here and there rose a white or silvery figure
in the waste garden of the earth, here and there came the sharp
vertical line of some cupola or obelisk. There were no hedges, no signs
of proprietary rights, no evidences of agriculture; the whole earth had
become a garden.

“So watching, I began to put my interpretation upon the things I had
seen, and as it shaped itself to me that evening, my interpretation was
something in this way. (Afterwards I found I had got only a half
truth—or only a glimpse of one facet of the truth.)

“It seemed to me that I had happened upon humanity upon the wane. The
ruddy sunset set me thinking of the sunset of mankind. For the first
time I began to realise an odd consequence of the social effort in
which we are at present engaged. And yet, come to think, it is a
logical consequence enough. Strength is the outcome of need; security
sets a premium on feebleness. The work of ameliorating the conditions
of life—the true civilising process that makes life more and more
secure—had gone steadily on to a climax. One triumph of a united
humanity over Nature had followed another. Things that are now mere
dreams had become projects deliberately put in hand and carried
forward. And the harvest was what I saw!

“After all, the sanitation and the agriculture of today are still in
the rudimentary stage. The science of our time has attacked but a
little department of the field of human disease, but, even so, it
spreads its operations very steadily and persistently. Our agriculture
and horticulture destroy a weed just here and there and cultivate
perhaps a score or so of wholesome plants, leaving the greater number
to fight out a balance as they can. We improve our favourite plants and
animals—and how few they are—gradually by selective breeding; now a new
and better peach, now a seedless grape, now a sweeter and larger
flower, now a more convenient breed of cattle. We improve them
gradually, because our ideals are vague and tentative, and our
knowledge is very limited; because Nature, too, is shy and slow in our
clumsy hands. Some day all this will be better organised, and still
better. That is the drift of the current in spite of the eddies. The
whole world will be intelligent, educated, and co-operating; things
will move faster and faster towards the subjugation of Nature. In the
end, wisely and carefully we shall readjust the balance of animal and
vegetable life to suit our human needs.

“This adjustment, I say, must have been done, and done well; done
indeed for all Time, in the space of Time across which my machine had
leapt. The air was free from gnats, the earth from weeds or fungi;
everywhere were fruits and sweet and delightful flowers; brilliant
butterflies flew hither and thither. The ideal of preventive medicine
was attained. Diseases had been stamped out. I saw no evidence of any
contagious diseases during all my stay. And I shall have to tell you
later that even the processes of putrefaction and decay had been
profoundly affected by these changes.

“Social triumphs, too, had been effected. I saw mankind housed in
splendid shelters, gloriously clothed, and as yet I had found them
engaged in no toil. There were no signs of struggle, neither social nor
economical struggle. The shop, the advertisement, traffic, all that
commerce which constitutes the body of our world, was gone. It was
natural on that golden evening that I should jump at the idea of a
social paradise. The difficulty of increasing population had been met,
I guessed, and population had ceased to increase.

“But with this change in condition comes inevitably adaptations to the
change. What, unless biological science is a mass of errors, is the
cause of human intelligence and vigour? Hardship and freedom:
conditions under which the active, strong, and subtle survive and the
weaker go to the wall; conditions that put a premium upon the loyal
alliance of capable men, upon self-restraint, patience, and decision.
And the institution of the family, and the emotions that arise therein,
the fierce jealousy, the tenderness for offspring, parental
self-devotion, all found their justification and support in the
imminent dangers of the young. _Now_, where are these imminent dangers?
There is a sentiment arising, and it will grow, against connubial
jealousy, against fierce maternity, against passion of all sorts;
unnecessary things now, and things that make us uncomfortable, savage
survivals, discords in a refined and pleasant life.

“I thought of the physical slightness of the people, their lack of
intelligence, and those big abundant ruins, and it strengthened my
belief in a perfect conquest of Nature. For after the battle comes
Quiet. Humanity had been strong, energetic, and intelligent, and had
used all its abundant vitality to alter the conditions under which it
lived. And now came the reaction of the altered conditions.

“Under the new conditions of perfect comfort and security, that
restless energy, that with us is strength, would become weakness. Even
in our own time certain tendencies and desires, once necessary to
survival, are a constant source of failure. Physical courage and the
love of battle, for instance, are no great help—may even be
hindrances—to a civilised man. And in a state of physical balance and
security, power, intellectual as well as physical, would be out of
place. For countless years I judged there had been no danger of war or
solitary violence, no danger from wild beasts, no wasting disease to
require strength of constitution, no need of toil. For such a life,
what we should call the weak are as well equipped as the strong, are
indeed no longer weak. Better equipped indeed they are, for the strong
would be fretted by an energy for which there was no outlet. No doubt
the exquisite beauty of the buildings I saw was the outcome of the last
surgings of the now purposeless energy of mankind before it settled
down into perfect harmony with the conditions under which it lived—the
flourish of that triumph which began the last great peace. This has
ever been the fate of energy in security; it takes to art and to
eroticism, and then come languor and decay.

“Even this artistic impetus would at last die away—had almost died in
the Time I saw. To adorn themselves with flowers, to dance, to sing in
the sunlight: so much was left of the artistic spirit, and no more.
Even that would fade in the end into a contented inactivity. We are
kept keen on the grindstone of pain and necessity, and it seemed to me
that here was that hateful grindstone broken at last!

“As I stood there in the gathering dark I thought that in this simple
explanation I had mastered the problem of the world—mastered the whole
secret of these delicious people. Possibly the checks they had devised
for the increase of population had succeeded too well, and their
numbers had rather diminished than kept stationary. That would account
for the abandoned ruins. Very simple was my explanation, and plausible
enough—as most wrong theories are!




 VII.
 A Sudden Shock


“As I stood there musing over this too perfect triumph of man, the full
moon, yellow and gibbous, came up out of an overflow of silver light in
the north-east. The bright little figures ceased to move about below, a
noiseless owl flitted by, and I shivered with the chill of the night. I
determined to descend and find where I could sleep.

“I looked for the building I knew. Then my eye travelled along to the
figure of the White Sphinx upon the pedestal of bronze, growing
distinct as the light of the rising moon grew brighter. I could see the
silver birch against it. There was the tangle of rhododendron bushes,
black in the pale light, and there was the little lawn. I looked at the
lawn again. A queer doubt chilled my complacency. ‘No,’ said I stoutly
to myself, ‘that was not the lawn.’

“But it _was_ the lawn. For the white leprous face of the sphinx was
towards it. Can you imagine what I felt as this conviction came home to
me? But you cannot. The Time Machine was gone!

“At once, like a lash across the face, came the possibility of losing
my own age, of being left helpless in this strange new world. The bare
thought of it was an actual physical sensation. I could feel it grip me
at the throat and stop my breathing. In another moment I was in a
passion of fear and running with great leaping strides down the slope.
Once I fell headlong and cut my face; I lost no time in stanching the
blood, but jumped up and ran on, with a warm trickle down my cheek and
chin. All the time I ran I was saying to myself: ‘They have moved it a
little, pushed it under the bushes out of the way.’ Nevertheless, I ran
with all my might. All the time, with the certainty that sometimes
comes with excessive dread, I knew that such assurance was folly, knew
instinctively that the machine was removed out of my reach. My breath
came with pain. I suppose I covered the whole distance from the hill
crest to the little lawn, two miles perhaps, in ten minutes. And I am
not a young man. I cursed aloud, as I ran, at my confident folly in
leaving the machine, wasting good breath thereby. I cried aloud, and
none answered. Not a creature seemed to be stirring in that moonlit
world.

“When I reached the lawn my worst fears were realised. Not a trace of
the thing was to be seen. I felt faint and cold when I faced the empty
space among the black tangle of bushes. I ran round it furiously, as if
the thing might be hidden in a corner, and then stopped abruptly, with
my hands clutching my hair. Above me towered the sphinx, upon the
bronze pedestal, white, shining, leprous, in the light of the rising
moon. It seemed to smile in mockery of my dismay.

“I might have consoled myself by imagining the little people had put
the mechanism in some shelter for me, had I not felt assured of their
physical and intellectual inadequacy. That is what dismayed me: the
sense of some hitherto unsuspected power, through whose intervention my
invention had vanished. Yet, for one thing I felt assured: unless some
other age had produced its exact duplicate, the machine could not have
moved in time. The attachment of the levers—I will show you the method
later—prevented anyone from tampering with it in that way when they
were removed. It had moved, and was hid, only in space. But then, where
could it be?

“I think I must have had a kind of frenzy. I remember running violently
in and out among the moonlit bushes all round the sphinx, and startling
some white animal that, in the dim light, I took for a small deer. I
remember, too, late that night, beating the bushes with my clenched
fist until my knuckles were gashed and bleeding from the broken twigs.
Then, sobbing and raving in my anguish of mind, I went down to the
great building of stone. The big hall was dark, silent, and deserted. I
slipped on the uneven floor, and fell over one of the malachite tables,
almost breaking my shin. I lit a match and went on past the dusty
curtains, of which I have told you.

“There I found a second great hall covered with cushions, upon which,
perhaps, a score or so of the little people were sleeping. I have no
doubt they found my second appearance strange enough, coming suddenly
out of the quiet darkness with inarticulate noises and the splutter and
flare of a match. For they had forgotten about matches. ‘Where is my
Time Machine?’ I began, bawling like an angry child, laying hands upon
them and shaking them up together. It must have been very queer to
them. Some laughed, most of them looked sorely frightened. When I saw
them standing round me, it came into my head that I was doing as
foolish a thing as it was possible for me to do under the
circumstances, in trying to revive the sensation of fear. For,
reasoning from their daylight behaviour, I thought that fear must be
forgotten.

“Abruptly, I dashed down the match, and knocking one of the people over
in my course, went blundering across the big dining-hall again, out
under the moonlight. I heard cries of terror and their little feet
running and stumbling this way and that. I do not remember all I did as
the moon crept up the sky. I suppose it was the unexpected nature of my
loss that maddened me. I felt hopelessly cut off from my own kind—a
strange animal in an unknown world. I must have raved to and fro,
screaming and crying upon God and Fate. I have a memory of horrible
fatigue, as the long night of despair wore away; of looking in this
impossible place and that; of groping among moonlit ruins and touching
strange creatures in the black shadows; at last, of lying on the ground
near the sphinx and weeping with absolute wretchedness, even anger at
the folly of leaving the machine having leaked away with my strength. I
had nothing left but misery. Then I slept, and when I woke again it was
full day, and a couple of sparrows were hopping round me on the turf
within reach of my arm.

“I sat up in the freshness of the morning, trying to remember how I had
got there, and why I had such a profound sense of desertion and
despair. Then things came clear in my mind. With the plain, reasonable
daylight, I could look my circumstances fairly in the face. I saw the
wild folly of my frenzy overnight, and I could reason with myself.
‘Suppose the worst?’ I said. ‘Suppose the machine altogether
lost—perhaps destroyed? It behoves me to be calm and patient, to learn
the way of the people, to get a clear idea of the method of my loss,
and the means of getting materials and tools; so that in the end,
perhaps, I may make another.’ That would be my only hope, a poor hope,
perhaps, but better than despair. And, after all, it was a beautiful
and curious world.

“But probably the machine had only been taken away. Still, I must be
calm and patient, find its hiding-place, and recover it by force or
cunning. And with that I scrambled to my feet and looked about me,
wondering where I could bathe. I felt weary, stiff, and travel-soiled.
The freshness of the morning made me desire an equal freshness. I had
exhausted my emotion. Indeed, as I went about my business, I found
myself wondering at my intense excitement overnight. I made a careful
examination of the ground about the little lawn. I wasted some time in
futile questionings, conveyed, as well as I was able, to such of the
little people as came by. They all failed to understand my gestures;
some were simply stolid, some thought it was a jest and laughed at me.
I had the hardest task in the world to keep my hands off their pretty
laughing faces. It was a foolish impulse, but the devil begotten of
fear and blind anger was ill curbed and still eager to take advantage
of my perplexity. The turf gave better counsel. I found a groove ripped
in it, about midway between the pedestal of the sphinx and the marks of
my feet where, on arrival, I had struggled with the overturned machine.
There were other signs of removal about, with queer narrow footprints
like those I could imagine made by a sloth. This directed my closer
attention to the pedestal. It was, as I think I have said, of bronze.
It was not a mere block, but highly decorated with deep framed panels
on either side. I went and rapped at these. The pedestal was hollow.
Examining the panels with care I found them discontinuous with the
frames. There were no handles or keyholes, but possibly the panels, if
they were doors, as I supposed, opened from within. One thing was clear
enough to my mind. It took no very great mental effort to infer that my
Time Machine was inside that pedestal. But how it got there was a
different problem.

“I saw the heads of two orange-clad people coming through the bushes
and under some blossom-covered apple-trees towards me. I turned smiling
to them, and beckoned them to me. They came, and then, pointing to the
bronze pedestal, I tried to intimate my wish to open it. But at my
first gesture towards this they behaved very oddly. I don’t know how to
convey their expression to you. Suppose you were to use a grossly
improper gesture to a delicate-minded woman—it is how she would look.
They went off as if they had received the last possible insult. I tried
a sweet-looking little chap in white next, with exactly the same
result. Somehow, his manner made me feel ashamed of myself. But, as you
know, I wanted the Time Machine, and I tried him once more. As he
turned off, like the others, my temper got the better of me. In three
strides I was after him, had him by the loose part of his robe round
the neck, and began dragging him towards the sphinx. Then I saw the
horror and repugnance of his face, and all of a sudden I let him go.

“But I was not beaten yet. I banged with my fist at the bronze panels.
I thought I heard something stir inside—to be explicit, I thought I
heard a sound like a chuckle—but I must have been mistaken. Then I got
a big pebble from the river, and came and hammered till I had flattened
a coil in the decorations, and the verdigris came off in powdery
flakes. The delicate little people must have heard me hammering in
gusty outbreaks a mile away on either hand, but nothing came of it. I
saw a crowd of them upon the slopes, looking furtively at me. At last,
hot and tired, I sat down to watch the place. But I was too restless to
watch long; I am too Occidental for a long vigil. I could work at a
problem for years, but to wait inactive for twenty-four hours—that is
another matter.

“I got up after a time, and began walking aimlessly through the bushes
towards the hill again. ‘Patience,’ said I to myself. ‘If you want your
machine again you must leave that sphinx alone. If they mean to take
your machine away, it’s little good your wrecking their bronze panels,
and if they don’t, you will get it back as soon as you can ask for it.
To sit among all those unknown things before a puzzle like that is
hopeless. That way lies monomania. Face this world. Learn its ways,
watch it, be careful of too hasty guesses at its meaning. In the end
you will find clues to it all.’ Then suddenly the humour of the
situation came into my mind: the thought of the years I had spent in
study and toil to get into the future age, and now my passion of
anxiety to get out of it. I had made myself the most complicated and
the most hopeless trap that ever a man devised. Although it was at my
own expense, I could not help myself. I laughed aloud.

“Going through the big palace, it seemed to me that the little people
avoided me. It may have been my fancy, or it may have had something to
do with my hammering at the gates of bronze. Yet I felt tolerably sure
of the avoidance. I was careful, however, to show no concern and to
abstain from any pursuit of them, and in the course of a day or two
things got back to the old footing. I made what progress I could in the
language, and in addition I pushed my explorations here and there.
Either I missed some subtle point or their language was excessively
simple—almost exclusively composed of concrete substantives and verbs.
There seemed to be few, if any, abstract terms, or little use of
figurative language. Their sentences were usually simple and of two
words, and I failed to convey or understand any but the simplest
propositions. I determined to put the thought of my Time Machine and
the mystery of the bronze doors under the sphinx, as much as possible
in a corner of memory, until my growing knowledge would lead me back to
them in a natural way. Yet a certain feeling, you may understand,
tethered me in a circle of a few miles round the point of my arrival.




 VIII.
 Explanation


“So far as I could see, all the world displayed the same exuberant
richness as the Thames valley. From every hill I climbed I saw the same
abundance of splendid buildings, endlessly varied in material and
style, the same clustering thickets of evergreens, the same
blossom-laden trees and tree ferns. Here and there water shone like
silver, and beyond, the land rose into blue undulating hills, and so
faded into the serenity of the sky. A peculiar feature, which presently
attracted my attention, was the presence of certain circular wells,
several, as it seemed to me, of a very great depth. One lay by the path
up the hill which I had followed during my first walk. Like the others,
it was rimmed with bronze, curiously wrought, and protected by a little
cupola from the rain. Sitting by the side of these wells, and peering
down into the shafted darkness, I could see no gleam of water, nor
could I start any reflection with a lighted match. But in all of them I
heard a certain sound: a thud—thud—thud, like the beating of some big
engine; and I discovered, from the flaring of my matches, that a steady
current of air set down the shafts. Further, I threw a scrap of paper
into the throat of one, and, instead of fluttering slowly down, it was
at once sucked swiftly out of sight.

“After a time, too, I came to connect these wells with tall towers
standing here and there upon the slopes; for above them there was often
just such a flicker in the air as one sees on a hot day above a
sun-scorched beach. Putting things together, I reached a strong
suggestion of an extensive system of subterranean ventilation, whose
true import it was difficult to imagine. I was at first inclined to
associate it with the sanitary apparatus of these people. It was an
obvious conclusion, but it was absolutely wrong.

“And here I must admit that I learnt very little of drains and bells
and modes of conveyance, and the like conveniences, during my time in
this real future. In some of these visions of Utopias and coming times
which I have read, there is a vast amount of detail about building, and
social arrangements, and so forth. But while such details are easy
enough to obtain when the whole world is contained in one’s
imagination, they are altogether inaccessible to a real traveller amid
such realities as I found here. Conceive the tale of London which a
negro, fresh from Central Africa, would take back to his tribe! What
would he know of railway companies, of social movements, of telephone
and telegraph wires, of the Parcels Delivery Company, and postal orders
and the like? Yet we, at least, should be willing enough to explain
these things to him! And even of what he knew, how much could he make
his untravelled friend either apprehend or believe? Then, think how
narrow the gap between a negro and a white man of our own times, and
how wide the interval between myself and these of the Golden Age! I was
sensible of much which was unseen, and which contributed to my comfort;
but save for a general impression of automatic organisation, I fear I
can convey very little of the difference to your mind.

“In the matter of sepulture, for instance, I could see no signs of
crematoria nor anything suggestive of tombs. But it occurred to me
that, possibly, there might be cemeteries (or crematoria) somewhere
beyond the range of my explorings. This, again, was a question I
deliberately put to myself, and my curiosity was at first entirely
defeated upon the point. The thing puzzled me, and I was led to make a
further remark, which puzzled me still more: that aged and infirm among
this people there were none.

“I must confess that my satisfaction with my first theories of an
automatic civilisation and a decadent humanity did not long endure. Yet
I could think of no other. Let me put my difficulties. The several big
palaces I had explored were mere living places, great dining-halls and
sleeping apartments. I could find no machinery, no appliances of any
kind. Yet these people were clothed in pleasant fabrics that must at
times need renewal, and their sandals, though undecorated, were fairly
complex specimens of metalwork. Somehow such things must be made. And
the little people displayed no vestige of a creative tendency. There
were no shops, no workshops, no sign of importations among them. They
spent all their time in playing gently, in bathing in the river, in
making love in a half-playful fashion, in eating fruit and sleeping. I
could not see how things were kept going.

“Then, again, about the Time Machine: something, I knew not what, had
taken it into the hollow pedestal of the White Sphinx. _Why?_ For the
life of me I could not imagine. Those waterless wells, too, those
flickering pillars. I felt I lacked a clue. I felt—how shall I put it?
Suppose you found an inscription, with sentences here and there in
excellent plain English, and interpolated therewith, others made up of
words, of letters even, absolutely unknown to you? Well, on the third
day of my visit, that was how the world of Eight Hundred and Two
Thousand Seven Hundred and One presented itself to me!

“That day, too, I made a friend—of a sort. It happened that, as I was
watching some of the little people bathing in a shallow, one of them
was seized with cramp and began drifting downstream. The main current
ran rather swiftly, but not too strongly for even a moderate swimmer.
It will give you an idea, therefore, of the strange deficiency in these
creatures, when I tell you that none made the slightest attempt to
rescue the weakly crying little thing which was drowning before their
eyes. When I realised this, I hurriedly slipped off my clothes, and,
wading in at a point lower down, I caught the poor mite and drew her
safe to land. A little rubbing of the limbs soon brought her round, and
I had the satisfaction of seeing she was all right before I left her. I
had got to such a low estimate of her kind that I did not expect any
gratitude from her. In that, however, I was wrong.

“This happened in the morning. In the afternoon I met my little woman,
as I believe it was, as I was returning towards my centre from an
exploration, and she received me with cries of delight and presented me
with a big garland of flowers—evidently made for me and me alone. The
thing took my imagination. Very possibly I had been feeling desolate.
At any rate I did my best to display my appreciation of the gift. We
were soon seated together in a little stone arbour, engaged in
conversation, chiefly of smiles. The creature’s friendliness affected
me exactly as a child’s might have done. We passed each other flowers,
and she kissed my hands. I did the same to hers. Then I tried talk, and
found that her name was Weena, which, though I don’t know what it
meant, somehow seemed appropriate enough. That was the beginning of a
queer friendship which lasted a week, and ended—as I will tell you!

“She was exactly like a child. She wanted to be with me always. She
tried to follow me everywhere, and on my next journey out and about it
went to my heart to tire her down, and leave her at last, exhausted and
calling after me rather plaintively. But the problems of the world had
to be mastered. I had not, I said to myself, come into the future to
carry on a miniature flirtation. Yet her distress when I left her was
very great, her expostulations at the parting were sometimes frantic,
and I think, altogether, I had as much trouble as comfort from her
devotion. Nevertheless she was, somehow, a very great comfort. I
thought it was mere childish affection that made her cling to me. Until
it was too late, I did not clearly know what I had inflicted upon her
when I left her. Nor until it was too late did I clearly understand
what she was to me. For, by merely seeming fond of me, and showing in
her weak, futile way that she cared for me, the little doll of a
creature presently gave my return to the neighbourhood of the White
Sphinx almost the feeling of coming home; and I would watch for her
tiny figure of white and gold so soon as I came over the hill.

“It was from her, too, that I learnt that fear had not yet left the
world. She was fearless enough in the daylight, and she had the oddest
confidence in me; for once, in a foolish moment, I made threatening
grimaces at her, and she simply laughed at them. But she dreaded the
dark, dreaded shadows, dreaded black things. Darkness to her was the
one thing dreadful. It was a singularly passionate emotion, and it set
me thinking and observing. I discovered then, among other things, that
these little people gathered into the great houses after dark, and
slept in droves. To enter upon them without a light was to put them
into a tumult of apprehension. I never found one out of doors, or one
sleeping alone within doors, after dark. Yet I was still such a
blockhead that I missed the lesson of that fear, and in spite of
Weena’s distress, I insisted upon sleeping away from these slumbering
multitudes.

“It troubled her greatly, but in the end her odd affection for me
triumphed, and for five of the nights of our acquaintance, including
the last night of all, she slept with her head pillowed on my arm. But
my story slips away from me as I speak of her. It must have been the
night before her rescue that I was awakened about dawn. I had been
restless, dreaming most disagreeably that I was drowned, and that sea
anemones were feeling over my face with their soft palps. I woke with a
start, and with an odd fancy that some greyish animal had just rushed
out of the chamber. I tried to get to sleep again, but I felt restless
and uncomfortable. It was that dim grey hour when things are just
creeping out of darkness, when everything is colourless and clear cut,
and yet unreal. I got up, and went down into the great hall, and so out
upon the flagstones in front of the palace. I thought I would make a
virtue of necessity, and see the sunrise.

“The moon was setting, and the dying moonlight and the first pallor of
dawn were mingled in a ghastly half-light. The bushes were inky black,
the ground a sombre grey, the sky colourless and cheerless. And up the
hill I thought I could see ghosts. Three several times, as I scanned
the slope, I saw white figures. Twice I fancied I saw a solitary white,
ape-like creature running rather quickly up the hill, and once near the
ruins I saw a leash of them carrying some dark body. They moved
hastily. I did not see what became of them. It seemed that they
vanished among the bushes. The dawn was still indistinct, you must
understand. I was feeling that chill, uncertain, early-morning feeling
you may have known. I doubted my eyes.

“As the eastern sky grew brighter, and the light of the day came on and
its vivid colouring returned upon the world once more, I scanned the
view keenly. But I saw no vestige of my white figures. They were mere
creatures of the half-light. ‘They must have been ghosts,’ I said; ‘I
wonder whence they dated.’ For a queer notion of Grant Allen’s came
into my head, and amused me. If each generation die and leave ghosts,
he argued, the world at last will get overcrowded with them. On that
theory they would have grown innumerable some Eight Hundred Thousand
Years hence, and it was no great wonder to see four at once. But the
jest was unsatisfying, and I was thinking of these figures all the
morning, until Weena’s rescue drove them out of my head. I associated
them in some indefinite way with the white animal I had startled in my
first passionate search for the Time Machine. But Weena was a pleasant
substitute. Yet all the same, they were soon destined to take far
deadlier possession of my mind.

“I think I have said how much hotter than our own was the weather of
this Golden Age. I cannot account for it. It may be that the sun was
hotter, or the earth nearer the sun. It is usual to assume that the sun
will go on cooling steadily in the future. But people, unfamiliar with
such speculations as those of the younger Darwin, forget that the
planets must ultimately fall back one by one into the parent body. As
these catastrophes occur, the sun will blaze with renewed energy; and
it may be that some inner planet had suffered this fate. Whatever the
reason, the fact remains that the sun was very much hotter than we know
it.

“Well, one very hot morning—my fourth, I think—as I was seeking shelter
from the heat and glare in a colossal ruin near the great house where I
slept and fed, there happened this strange thing. Clambering among
these heaps of masonry, I found a narrow gallery, whose end and side
windows were blocked by fallen masses of stone. By contrast with the
brilliancy outside, it seemed at first impenetrably dark to me. I
entered it groping, for the change from light to blackness made spots
of colour swim before me. Suddenly I halted spellbound. A pair of eyes,
luminous by reflection against the daylight without, was watching me
out of the darkness.

“The old instinctive dread of wild beasts came upon me. I clenched my
hands and steadfastly looked into the glaring eyeballs. I was afraid to
turn. Then the thought of the absolute security in which humanity
appeared to be living came to my mind. And then I remembered that
strange terror of the dark. Overcoming my fear to some extent, I
advanced a step and spoke. I will admit that my voice was harsh and
ill-controlled. I put out my hand and touched something soft. At once
the eyes darted sideways, and something white ran past me. I turned
with my heart in my mouth, and saw a queer little ape-like figure, its
head held down in a peculiar manner, running across the sunlit space
behind me. It blundered against a block of granite, staggered aside,
and in a moment was hidden in a black shadow beneath another pile of
ruined masonry.

“My impression of it is, of course, imperfect; but I know it was a dull
white, and had strange large greyish-red eyes; also that there was
flaxen hair on its head and down its back. But, as I say, it went too
fast for me to see distinctly. I cannot even say whether it ran on all
fours, or only with its forearms held very low. After an instant’s
pause I followed it into the second heap of ruins. I could not find it
at first; but, after a time in the profound obscurity, I came upon one
of those round well-like openings of which I have told you, half closed
by a fallen pillar. A sudden thought came to me. Could this Thing have
vanished down the shaft? I lit a match, and, looking down, I saw a
small, white, moving creature, with large bright eyes which regarded me
steadfastly as it retreated. It made me shudder. It was so like a human
spider! It was clambering down the wall, and now I saw for the first
time a number of metal foot and hand rests forming a kind of ladder
down the shaft. Then the light burned my fingers and fell out of my
hand, going out as it dropped, and when I had lit another the little
monster had disappeared.

“I do not know how long I sat peering down that well. It was not for
some time that I could succeed in persuading myself that the thing I
had seen was human. But, gradually, the truth dawned on me: that Man
had not remained one species, but had differentiated into two distinct
animals: that my graceful children of the Upper World were not the sole
descendants of our generation, but that this bleached, obscene,
nocturnal Thing, which had flashed before me, was also heir to all the
ages.

“I thought of the flickering pillars and of my theory of an underground
ventilation. I began to suspect their true import. And what, I
wondered, was this Lemur doing in my scheme of a perfectly balanced
organisation? How was it related to the indolent serenity of the
beautiful Overworlders? And what was hidden down there, at the foot of
that shaft? I sat upon the edge of the well telling myself that, at any
rate, there was nothing to fear, and that there I must descend for the
solution of my difficulties. And withal I was absolutely afraid to go!
As I hesitated, two of the beautiful upperworld people came running in
their amorous sport across the daylight in the shadow. The male pursued
the female, flinging flowers at her as he ran.

“They seemed distressed to find me, my arm against the overturned
pillar, peering down the well. Apparently it was considered bad form to
remark these apertures; for when I pointed to this one, and tried to
frame a question about it in their tongue, they were still more visibly
distressed and turned away. But they were interested by my matches, and
I struck some to amuse them. I tried them again about the well, and
again I failed. So presently I left them, meaning to go back to Weena,
and see what I could get from her. But my mind was already in
revolution; my guesses and impressions were slipping and sliding to a
new adjustment. I had now a clue to the import of these wells, to the
ventilating towers, to the mystery of the ghosts; to say nothing of a
hint at the meaning of the bronze gates and the fate of the Time
Machine! And very vaguely there came a suggestion towards the solution
of the economic problem that had puzzled me.

“Here was the new view. Plainly, this second species of Man was
subterranean. There were three circumstances in particular which made
me think that its rare emergence above ground was the outcome of a
long-continued underground habit. In the first place, there was the
bleached look common in most animals that live largely in the dark—the
white fish of the Kentucky caves, for instance. Then, those large eyes,
with that capacity for reflecting light, are common features of
nocturnal things—witness the owl and the cat. And last of all, that
evident confusion in the sunshine, that hasty yet fumbling awkward
flight towards dark shadow, and that peculiar carriage of the head
while in the light—all reinforced the theory of an extreme
sensitiveness of the retina.

“Beneath my feet, then, the earth must be tunnelled enormously, and
these tunnellings were the habitat of the New Race. The presence of
ventilating shafts and wells along the hill slopes—everywhere, in fact,
except along the river valley—showed how universal were its
ramifications. What so natural, then, as to assume that it was in this
artificial Underworld that such work as was necessary to the comfort of
the daylight race was done? The notion was so plausible that I at once
accepted it, and went on to assume the _how_ of this splitting of the
human species. I dare say you will anticipate the shape of my theory;
though, for myself, I very soon felt that it fell far short of the
truth.

“At first, proceeding from the problems of our own age, it seemed clear
as daylight to me that the gradual widening of the present merely
temporary and social difference between the Capitalist and the Labourer
was the key to the whole position. No doubt it will seem grotesque
enough to you—and wildly incredible!—and yet even now there are
existing circumstances to point that way. There is a tendency to
utilise underground space for the less ornamental purposes of
civilisation; there is the Metropolitan Railway in London, for
instance, there are new electric railways, there are subways, there are
underground workrooms and restaurants, and they increase and multiply.
Evidently, I thought, this tendency had increased till Industry had
gradually lost its birthright in the sky. I mean that it had gone
deeper and deeper into larger and ever larger underground factories,
spending a still-increasing amount of its time therein, till, in the
end—! Even now, does not an East-end worker live in such artificial
conditions as practically to be cut off from the natural surface of the
earth?

“Again, the exclusive tendency of richer people—due, no doubt, to the
increasing refinement of their education, and the widening gulf between
them and the rude violence of the poor—is already leading to the
closing, in their interest, of considerable portions of the surface of
the land. About London, for instance, perhaps half the prettier country
is shut in against intrusion. And this same widening gulf—which is due
to the length and expense of the higher educational process and the
increased facilities for and temptations towards refined habits on the
part of the rich—will make that exchange between class and class, that
promotion by intermarriage which at present retards the splitting of
our species along lines of social stratification, less and less
frequent. So, in the end, above ground you must have the Haves,
pursuing pleasure and comfort and beauty, and below ground the
Have-nots, the Workers getting continually adapted to the conditions of
their labour. Once they were there, they would no doubt have to pay
rent, and not a little of it, for the ventilation of their caverns; and
if they refused, they would starve or be suffocated for arrears. Such
of them as were so constituted as to be miserable and rebellious would
die; and, in the end, the balance being permanent, the survivors would
become as well adapted to the conditions of underground life, and as
happy in their way, as the Overworld people were to theirs. As it
seemed to me, the refined beauty and the etiolated pallor followed
naturally enough.

“The great triumph of Humanity I had dreamed of took a different shape
in my mind. It had been no such triumph of moral education and general
co-operation as I had imagined. Instead, I saw a real aristocracy,
armed with a perfected science and working to a logical conclusion the
industrial system of today. Its triumph had not been simply a triumph
over Nature, but a triumph over Nature and the fellow-man. This, I must
warn you, was my theory at the time. I had no convenient cicerone in
the pattern of the Utopian books. My explanation may be absolutely
wrong. I still think it is the most plausible one. But even on this
supposition the balanced civilisation that was at last attained must
have long since passed its zenith, and was now far fallen into decay.
The too-perfect security of the Overworlders had led them to a slow
movement of degeneration, to a general dwindling in size, strength, and
intelligence. That I could see clearly enough already. What had
happened to the Undergrounders I did not yet suspect; but, from what I
had seen of the Morlocks—that, by the bye, was the name by which these
creatures were called—I could imagine that the modification of the
human type was even far more profound than among the ‘Eloi,’ the
beautiful race that I already knew.

“Then came troublesome doubts. Why had the Morlocks taken my Time
Machine? For I felt sure it was they who had taken it. Why, too, if the
Eloi were masters, could they not restore the machine to me? And why
were they so terribly afraid of the dark? I proceeded, as I have said,
to question Weena about this Underworld, but here again I was
disappointed. At first she would not understand my questions, and
presently she refused to answer them. She shivered as though the topic
was unendurable. And when I pressed her, perhaps a little harshly, she
burst into tears. They were the only tears, except my own, I ever saw
in that Golden Age. When I saw them I ceased abruptly to trouble about
the Morlocks, and was only concerned in banishing these signs of her
human inheritance from Weena’s eyes. And very soon she was smiling and
clapping her hands, while I solemnly burnt a match.




 IX.
 The Morlocks


“It may seem odd to you, but it was two days before I could follow up
the new-found clue in what was manifestly the proper way. I felt a
peculiar shrinking from those pallid bodies. They were just the
half-bleached colour of the worms and things one sees preserved in
spirit in a zoological museum. And they were filthily cold to the
touch. Probably my shrinking was largely due to the sympathetic
influence of the Eloi, whose disgust of the Morlocks I now began to
appreciate.

“The next night I did not sleep well. Probably my health was a little
disordered. I was oppressed with perplexity and doubt. Once or twice I
had a feeling of intense fear for which I could perceive no definite
reason. I remember creeping noiselessly into the great hall where the
little people were sleeping in the moonlight—that night Weena was among
them—and feeling reassured by their presence. It occurred to me even
then, that in the course of a few days the moon must pass through its
last quarter, and the nights grow dark, when the appearances of these
unpleasant creatures from below, these whitened Lemurs, this new vermin
that had replaced the old, might be more abundant. And on both these
days I had the restless feeling of one who shirks an inevitable duty. I
felt assured that the Time Machine was only to be recovered by boldly
penetrating these mysteries of underground. Yet I could not face the
mystery. If only I had had a companion it would have been different.
But I was so horribly alone, and even to clamber down into the darkness
of the well appalled me. I don’t know if you will understand my
feeling, but I never felt quite safe at my back.

“It was this restlessness, this insecurity, perhaps, that drove me
farther and farther afield in my exploring expeditions. Going to the
south-westward towards the rising country that is now called Combe
Wood, I observed far-off, in the direction of nineteenth-century
Banstead, a vast green structure, different in character from any I had
hitherto seen. It was larger than the largest of the palaces or ruins I
knew, and the façade had an Oriental look: the face of it having the
lustre, as well as the pale-green tint, a kind of bluish-green, of a
certain type of Chinese porcelain. This difference in aspect suggested
a difference in use, and I was minded to push on and explore. But the
day was growing late, and I had come upon the sight of the place after
a long and tiring circuit; so I resolved to hold over the adventure for
the following day, and I returned to the welcome and the caresses of
little Weena. But next morning I perceived clearly enough that my
curiosity regarding the Palace of Green Porcelain was a piece of
self-deception, to enable me to shirk, by another day, an experience I
dreaded. I resolved I would make the descent without further waste of
time, and started out in the early morning towards a well near the
ruins of granite and aluminium.

“Little Weena ran with me. She danced beside me to the well, but when
she saw me lean over the mouth and look downward, she seemed strangely
disconcerted. ‘Good-bye, little Weena,’ I said, kissing her; and then
putting her down, I began to feel over the parapet for the climbing
hooks. Rather hastily, I may as well confess, for I feared my courage
might leak away! At first she watched me in amazement. Then she gave a
most piteous cry, and running to me, she began to pull at me with her
little hands. I think her opposition nerved me rather to proceed. I
shook her off, perhaps a little roughly, and in another moment I was in
the throat of the well. I saw her agonised face over the parapet, and
smiled to reassure her. Then I had to look down at the unstable hooks
to which I clung.

“I had to clamber down a shaft of perhaps two hundred yards. The
descent was effected by means of metallic bars projecting from the
sides of the well, and these being adapted to the needs of a creature
much smaller and lighter than myself, I was speedily cramped and
fatigued by the descent. And not simply fatigued! One of the bars bent
suddenly under my weight, and almost swung me off into the blackness
beneath. For a moment I hung by one hand, and after that experience I
did not dare to rest again. Though my arms and back were presently
acutely painful, I went on clambering down the sheer descent with as
quick a motion as possible. Glancing upward, I saw the aperture, a
small blue disc, in which a star was visible, while little Weena’s head
showed as a round black projection. The thudding sound of a machine
below grew louder and more oppressive. Everything save that little disc
above was profoundly dark, and when I looked up again Weena had
disappeared.

“I was in an agony of discomfort. I had some thought of trying to go up
the shaft again, and leave the Underworld alone. But even while I
turned this over in my mind I continued to descend. At last, with
intense relief, I saw dimly coming up, a foot to the right of me, a
slender loophole in the wall. Swinging myself in, I found it was the
aperture of a narrow horizontal tunnel in which I could lie down and
rest. It was not too soon. My arms ached, my back was cramped, and I
was trembling with the prolonged terror of a fall. Besides this, the
unbroken darkness had had a distressing effect upon my eyes. The air
was full of the throb and hum of machinery pumping air down the shaft.

“I do not know how long I lay. I was arroused by a soft hand touching
my face. Starting up in the darkness I snatched at my matches and,
hastily striking one, I saw three stooping white creatures similar to
the one I had seen above ground in the ruin, hastily retreating before
the light. Living, as they did, in what appeared to me impenetrable
darkness, their eyes were abnormally large and sensitive, just as are
the pupils of the abysmal fishes, and they reflected the light in the
same way. I have no doubt they could see me in that rayless obscurity,
and they did not seem to have any fear of me apart from the light. But,
so soon as I struck a match in order to see them, they fled
incontinently, vanishing into dark gutters and tunnels, from which
their eyes glared at me in the strangest fashion.

“I tried to call to them, but the language they had was apparently
different from that of the Overworld people; so that I was needs left
to my own unaided efforts, and the thought of flight before exploration
was even then in my mind. But I said to myself, ‘You are in for it
now,’ and, feeling my way along the tunnel, I found the noise of
machinery grow louder. Presently the walls fell away from me, and I
came to a large open space, and striking another match, saw that I had
entered a vast arched cavern, which stretched into utter darkness
beyond the range of my light. The view I had of it was as much as one
could see in the burning of a match.

“Necessarily my memory is vague. Great shapes like big machines rose
out of the dimness, and cast grotesque black shadows, in which dim
spectral Morlocks sheltered from the glare. The place, by the bye, was
very stuffy and oppressive, and the faint halitus of freshly-shed blood
was in the air. Some way down the central vista was a little table of
white metal, laid with what seemed a meal. The Morlocks at any rate
were carnivorous! Even at the time, I remember wondering what large
animal could have survived to furnish the red joint I saw. It was all
very indistinct: the heavy smell, the big unmeaning shapes, the obscene
figures lurking in the shadows, and only waiting for the darkness to
come at me again! Then the match burnt down, and stung my fingers, and
fell, a wriggling red spot in the blackness.

“I have thought since how particularly ill-equipped I was for such an
experience. When I had started with the Time Machine, I had started
with the absurd assumption that the men of the Future would certainly
be infinitely ahead of ourselves in all their appliances. I had come
without arms, without medicine, without anything to smoke—at times I
missed tobacco frightfully!—even without enough matches. If only I had
thought of a Kodak! I could have flashed that glimpse of the Underworld
in a second, and examined it at leisure. But, as it was, I stood there
with only the weapons and the powers that Nature had endowed me
with—hands, feet, and teeth; these, and four safety-matches that still
remained to me.

“I was afraid to push my way in among all this machinery in the dark,
and it was only with my last glimpse of light I discovered that my
store of matches had run low. It had never occurred to me until that
moment that there was any need to economise them, and I had wasted
almost half the box in astonishing the Overworlders, to whom fire was a
novelty. Now, as I say, I had four left, and while I stood in the dark,
a hand touched mine, lank fingers came feeling over my face, and I was
sensible of a peculiar unpleasant odour. I fancied I heard the
breathing of a crowd of those dreadful little beings about me. I felt
the box of matches in my hand being gently disengaged, and other hands
behind me plucking at my clothing. The sense of these unseen creatures
examining me was indescribably unpleasant. The sudden realisation of my
ignorance of their ways of thinking and doing came home to me very
vividly in the darkness. I shouted at them as loudly as I could. They
started away, and then I could feel them approaching me again. They
clutched at me more boldly, whispering odd sounds to each other. I
shivered violently, and shouted again—rather discordantly. This time
they were not so seriously alarmed, and they made a queer laughing
noise as they came back at me. I will confess I was horribly
frightened. I determined to strike another match and escape under the
protection of its glare. I did so, and eking out the flicker with a
scrap of paper from my pocket, I made good my retreat to the narrow
tunnel. But I had scarce entered this when my light was blown out and
in the blackness I could hear the Morlocks rustling like wind among
leaves, and pattering like the rain, as they hurried after me.

“In a moment I was clutched by several hands, and there was no
mistaking that they were trying to haul me back. I struck another
light, and waved it in their dazzled faces. You can scarce imagine how
nauseatingly inhuman they looked—those pale, chinless faces and great,
lidless, pinkish-grey eyes!—as they stared in their blindness and
bewilderment. But I did not stay to look, I promise you: I retreated
again, and when my second match had ended, I struck my third. It had
almost burnt through when I reached the opening into the shaft. I lay
down on the edge, for the throb of the great pump below made me giddy.
Then I felt sideways for the projecting hooks, and, as I did so, my
feet were grasped from behind, and I was violently tugged backward. I
lit my last match … and it incontinently went out. But I had my hand on
the climbing bars now, and, kicking violently, I disengaged myself from
the clutches of the Morlocks, and was speedily clambering up the shaft,
while they stayed peering and blinking up at me: all but one little
wretch who followed me for some way, and well-nigh secured my boot as a
trophy.

“That climb seemed interminable to me. With the last twenty or thirty
feet of it a deadly nausea came upon me. I had the greatest difficulty
in keeping my hold. The last few yards was a frightful struggle against
this faintness. Several times my head swam, and I felt all the
sensations of falling. At last, however, I got over the well-mouth
somehow, and staggered out of the ruin into the blinding sunlight. I
fell upon my face. Even the soil smelt sweet and clean. Then I remember
Weena kissing my hands and ears, and the voices of others among the
Eloi. Then, for a time, I was insensible.




 X.
 When Night Came


“Now, indeed, I seemed in a worse case than before. Hitherto, except
during my night’s anguish at the loss of the Time Machine, I had felt a
sustaining hope of ultimate escape, but that hope was staggered by
these new discoveries. Hitherto I had merely thought myself impeded by
the childish simplicity of the little people, and by some unknown
forces which I had only to understand to overcome; but there was an
altogether new element in the sickening quality of the Morlocks—a
something inhuman and malign. Instinctively I loathed them. Before, I
had felt as a man might feel who had fallen into a pit: my concern was
with the pit and how to get out of it. Now I felt like a beast in a
trap, whose enemy would come upon him soon.

“The enemy I dreaded may surprise you. It was the darkness of the new
moon. Weena had put this into my head by some at first incomprehensible
remarks about the Dark Nights. It was not now such a very difficult
problem to guess what the coming Dark Nights might mean. The moon was
on the wane: each night there was a longer interval of darkness. And I
now understood to some slight degree at least the reason of the fear of
the little Upperworld people for the dark. I wondered vaguely what foul
villainy it might be that the Morlocks did under the new moon. I felt
pretty sure now that my second hypothesis was all wrong. The Upperworld
people might once have been the favoured aristocracy, and the Morlocks
their mechanical servants: but that had long since passed away. The two
species that had resulted from the evolution of man were sliding down
towards, or had already arrived at, an altogether new relationship. The
Eloi, like the Carlovignan kings, had decayed to a mere beautiful
futility. They still possessed the earth on sufferance: since the
Morlocks, subterranean for innumerable generations, had come at last to
find the daylit surface intolerable. And the Morlocks made their
garments, I inferred, and maintained them in their habitual needs,
perhaps through the survival of an old habit of service. They did it as
a standing horse paws with his foot, or as a man enjoys killing animals
in sport: because ancient and departed necessities had impressed it on
the organism. But, clearly, the old order was already in part reversed.
The Nemesis of the delicate ones was creeping on apace. Ages ago,
thousands of generations ago, man had thrust his brother man out of the
ease and the sunshine. And now that brother was coming back—changed!
Already the Eloi had begun to learn one old lesson anew. They were
becoming reacquainted with Fear. And suddenly there came into my head
the memory of the meat I had seen in the Underworld. It seemed odd how
it floated into my mind: not stirred up as it were by the current of my
meditations, but coming in almost like a question from outside. I tried
to recall the form of it. I had a vague sense of something familiar,
but I could not tell what it was at the time.

“Still, however helpless the little people in the presence of their
mysterious Fear, I was differently constituted. I came out of this age
of ours, this ripe prime of the human race, when Fear does not paralyse
and mystery has lost its terrors. I at least would defend myself.
Without further delay I determined to make myself arms and a fastness
where I might sleep. With that refuge as a base, I could face this
strange world with some of that confidence I had lost in realising to
what creatures night by night I lay exposed. I felt I could never sleep
again until my bed was secure from them. I shuddered with horror to
think how they must already have examined me.

“I wandered during the afternoon along the valley of the Thames, but
found nothing that commended itself to my mind as inaccessible. All the
buildings and trees seemed easily practicable to such dexterous
climbers as the Morlocks, to judge by their wells, must be. Then the
tall pinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain and the polished gleam
of its walls came back to my memory; and in the evening, taking Weena
like a child upon my shoulder, I went up the hills towards the
south-west. The distance, I had reckoned, was seven or eight miles, but
it must have been nearer eighteen. I had first seen the place on a
moist afternoon when distances are deceptively diminished. In addition,
the heel of one of my shoes was loose, and a nail was working through
the sole—they were comfortable old shoes I wore about indoors—so that I
was lame. And it was already long past sunset when I came in sight of
the palace, silhouetted black against the pale yellow of the sky.

“Weena had been hugely delighted when I began to carry her, but after a
while she desired me to let her down, and ran along by the side of me,
occasionally darting off on either hand to pick flowers to stick in my
pockets. My pockets had always puzzled Weena, but at the last she had
concluded that they were an eccentric kind of vases for floral
decoration. At least she utilised them for that purpose. And that
reminds me! In changing my jacket I found…”

_The Time Traveller paused, put his hand into his pocket, and silently
placed two withered flowers, not unlike very large white mallows, upon
the little table. Then he resumed his narrative._

“As the hush of evening crept over the world and we proceeded over the
hill crest towards Wimbledon, Weena grew tired and wanted to return to
the house of grey stone. But I pointed out the distant pinnacles of the
Palace of Green Porcelain to her, and contrived to make her understand
that we were seeking a refuge there from her Fear. You know that great
pause that comes upon things before the dusk? Even the breeze stops in
the trees. To me there is always an air of expectation about that
evening stillness. The sky was clear, remote, and empty save for a few
horizontal bars far down in the sunset. Well, that night the
expectation took the colour of my fears. In that darkling calm my
senses seemed preternaturally sharpened. I fancied I could even feel
the hollowness of the ground beneath my feet: could, indeed, almost see
through it the Morlocks on their ant-hill going hither and thither and
waiting for the dark. In my excitement I fancied that they would
receive my invasion of their burrows as a declaration of war. And why
had they taken my Time Machine?

“So we went on in the quiet, and the twilight deepened into night. The
clear blue of the distance faded, and one star after another came out.
The ground grew dim and the trees black. Weena’s fears and her fatigue
grew upon her. I took her in my arms and talked to her and caressed
her. Then, as the darkness grew deeper, she put her arms round my neck,
and, closing her eyes, tightly pressed her face against my shoulder. So
we went down a long slope into a valley, and there in the dimness I
almost walked into a little river. This I waded, and went up the
opposite side of the valley, past a number of sleeping houses, and by a
statue—a Faun, or some such figure, _minus_ the head. Here too were
acacias. So far I had seen nothing of the Morlocks, but it was yet
early in the night, and the darker hours before the old moon rose were
still to come.

“From the brow of the next hill I saw a thick wood spreading wide and
black before me. I hesitated at this. I could see no end to it, either
to the right or the left. Feeling tired—my feet, in particular, were
very sore—I carefully lowered Weena from my shoulder as I halted, and
sat down upon the turf. I could no longer see the Palace of Green
Porcelain, and I was in doubt of my direction. I looked into the
thickness of the wood and thought of what it might hide. Under that
dense tangle of branches one would be out of sight of the stars. Even
were there no other lurking danger—a danger I did not care to let my
imagination loose upon—there would still be all the roots to stumble
over and the tree-boles to strike against. I was very tired, too, after
the excitements of the day; so I decided that I would not face it, but
would pass the night upon the open hill.

“Weena, I was glad to find, was fast asleep. I carefully wrapped her in
my jacket, and sat down beside her to wait for the moonrise. The
hillside was quiet and deserted, but from the black of the wood there
came now and then a stir of living things. Above me shone the stars,
for the night was very clear. I felt a certain sense of friendly
comfort in their twinkling. All the old constellations had gone from
the sky, however: that slow movement which is imperceptible in a
hundred human lifetimes, had long since rearranged them in unfamiliar
groupings. But the Milky Way, it seemed to me, was still the same
tattered streamer of star-dust as of yore. Southward (as I judged it)
was a very bright red star that was new to me; it was even more
splendid than our own green Sirius. And amid all these scintillating
points of light one bright planet shone kindly and steadily like the
face of an old friend.

“Looking at these stars suddenly dwarfed my own troubles and all the
gravities of terrestrial life. I thought of their unfathomable
distance, and the slow inevitable drift of their movements out of the
unknown past into the unknown future. I thought of the great
precessional cycle that the pole of the earth describes. Only forty
times had that silent revolution occurred during all the years that I
had traversed. And during these few revolutions all the activity, all
the traditions, the complex organisations, the nations, languages,
literatures, aspirations, even the mere memory of Man as I knew him,
had been swept out of existence. Instead were these frail creatures who
had forgotten their high ancestry, and the white Things of which I went
in terror. Then I thought of the Great Fear that was between the two
species, and for the first time, with a sudden shiver, came the clear
knowledge of what the meat I had seen might be. Yet it was too
horrible! I looked at little Weena sleeping beside me, her face white
and starlike under the stars, and forthwith dismissed the thought.

“Through that long night I held my mind off the Morlocks as well as I
could, and whiled away the time by trying to fancy I could find signs
of the old constellations in the new confusion. The sky kept very
clear, except for a hazy cloud or so. No doubt I dozed at times. Then,
as my vigil wore on, came a faintness in the eastward sky, like the
reflection of some colourless fire, and the old moon rose, thin and
peaked and white. And close behind, and overtaking it, and overflowing
it, the dawn came, pale at first, and then growing pink and warm. No
Morlocks had approached us. Indeed, I had seen none upon the hill that
night. And in the confidence of renewed day it almost seemed to me that
my fear had been unreasonable. I stood up and found my foot with the
loose heel swollen at the ankle and painful under the heel; so I sat
down again, took off my shoes, and flung them away.

“I awakened Weena, and we went down into the wood, now green and
pleasant instead of black and forbidding. We found some fruit wherewith
to break our fast. We soon met others of the dainty ones, laughing and
dancing in the sunlight as though there was no such thing in nature as
the night. And then I thought once more of the meat that I had seen. I
felt assured now of what it was, and from the bottom of my heart I
pitied this last feeble rill from the great flood of humanity. Clearly,
at some time in the Long-Ago of human decay the Morlocks’ food had run
short. Possibly they had lived on rats and such-like vermin. Even now
man is far less discriminating and exclusive in his food than he
was—far less than any monkey. His prejudice against human flesh is no
deep-seated instinct. And so these inhuman sons of men——! I tried to
look at the thing in a scientific spirit. After all, they were less
human and more remote than our cannibal ancestors of three or four
thousand years ago. And the intelligence that would have made this
state of things a torment had gone. Why should I trouble myself? These
Eloi were mere fatted cattle, which the ant-like Morlocks preserved and
preyed upon—probably saw to the breeding of. And there was Weena
dancing at my side!

“Then I tried to preserve myself from the horror that was coming upon
me, by regarding it as a rigorous punishment of human selfishness. Man
had been content to live in ease and delight upon the labours of his
fellow-man, had taken Necessity as his watchword and excuse, and in the
fullness of time Necessity had come home to him. I even tried a
Carlyle-like scorn of this wretched aristocracy in decay. But this
attitude of mind was impossible. However great their intellectual
degradation, the Eloi had kept too much of the human form not to claim
my sympathy, and to make me perforce a sharer in their degradation and
their Fear.

“I had at that time very vague ideas as to the course I should pursue.
My first was to secure some safe place of refuge, and to make myself
such arms of metal or stone as I could contrive. That necessity was
immediate. In the next place, I hoped to procure some means of fire, so
that I should have the weapon of a torch at hand, for nothing, I knew,
would be more efficient against these Morlocks. Then I wanted to
arrange some contrivance to break open the doors of bronze under the
White Sphinx. I had in mind a battering ram. I had a persuasion that if
I could enter those doors and carry a blaze of light before me I should
discover the Time Machine and escape. I could not imagine the Morlocks
were strong enough to move it far away. Weena I had resolved to bring
with me to our own time. And turning such schemes over in my mind I
pursued our way towards the building which my fancy had chosen as our
dwelling.




 XI.
 The Palace of Green Porcelain


“I found the Palace of Green Porcelain, when we approached it about
noon, deserted and falling into ruin. Only ragged vestiges of glass
remained in its windows, and great sheets of the green facing had
fallen away from the corroded metallic framework. It lay very high upon
a turfy down, and looking north-eastward before I entered it, I was
surprised to see a large estuary, or even creek, where I judged
Wandsworth and Battersea must once have been. I thought then—though I
never followed up the thought—of what might have happened, or might be
happening, to the living things in the sea.

“The material of the Palace proved on examination to be indeed
porcelain, and along the face of it I saw an inscription in some
unknown character. I thought, rather foolishly, that Weena might help
me to interpret this, but I only learnt that the bare idea of writing
had never entered her head. She always seemed to me, I fancy, more
human than she was, perhaps because her affection was so human.

“Within the big valves of the door—which were open and broken—we found,
instead of the customary hall, a long gallery lit by many side windows.
At the first glance I was reminded of a museum. The tiled floor was
thick with dust, and a remarkable array of miscellaneous objects was
shrouded in the same grey covering. Then I perceived, standing strange
and gaunt in the centre of the hall, what was clearly the lower part of
a huge skeleton. I recognised by the oblique feet that it was some
extinct creature after the fashion of the Megatherium. The skull and
the upper bones lay beside it in the thick dust, and in one place,
where rain-water had dropped through a leak in the roof, the thing
itself had been worn away. Further in the gallery was the huge skeleton
barrel of a Brontosaurus. My museum hypothesis was confirmed. Going
towards the side I found what appeared to be sloping shelves, and
clearing away the thick dust, I found the old familiar glass cases of
our own time. But they must have been air-tight to judge from the fair
preservation of some of their contents.

“Clearly we stood among the ruins of some latter-day South Kensington!
Here, apparently, was the Palæontological Section, and a very splendid
array of fossils it must have been, though the inevitable process of
decay that had been staved off for a time, and had, through the
extinction of bacteria and fungi, lost ninety-nine hundredths of its
force, was nevertheless, with extreme sureness if with extreme slowness
at work again upon all its treasures. Here and there I found traces of
the little people in the shape of rare fossils broken to pieces or
threaded in strings upon reeds. And the cases had in some instances
been bodily removed—by the Morlocks, as I judged. The place was very
silent. The thick dust deadened our footsteps. Weena, who had been
rolling a sea urchin down the sloping glass of a case, presently came,
as I stared about me, and very quietly took my hand and stood beside
me.

“And at first I was so much surprised by this ancient monument of an
intellectual age that I gave no thought to the possibilities it
presented. Even my preoccupation about the Time Machine receded a
little from my mind.

“To judge from the size of the place, this Palace of Green Porcelain
had a great deal more in it than a Gallery of Palæontology; possibly
historical galleries; it might be, even a library! To me, at least in
my present circumstances, these would be vastly more interesting than
this spectacle of old-time geology in decay. Exploring, I found another
short gallery running transversely to the first. This appeared to be
devoted to minerals, and the sight of a block of sulphur set my mind
running on gunpowder. But I could find no saltpetre; indeed, no
nitrates of any kind. Doubtless they had deliquesced ages ago. Yet the
sulphur hung in my mind, and set up a train of thinking. As for the
rest of the contents of that gallery, though on the whole they were the
best preserved of all I saw, I had little interest. I am no specialist
in mineralogy, and I went on down a very ruinous aisle running parallel
to the first hall I had entered. Apparently this section had been
devoted to natural history, but everything had long since passed out of
recognition. A few shrivelled and blackened vestiges of what had once
been stuffed animals, desiccated mummies in jars that had once held
spirit, a brown dust of departed plants: that was all! I was sorry for
that, because I should have been glad to trace the patient
readjustments by which the conquest of animated nature had been
attained. Then we came to a gallery of simply colossal proportions, but
singularly ill-lit, the floor of it running downward at a slight angle
from the end at which I entered. At intervals white globes hung from
the ceiling—many of them cracked and smashed—which suggested that
originally the place had been artificially lit. Here I was more in my
element, for rising on either side of me were the huge bulks of big
machines, all greatly corroded and many broken down, but some still
fairly complete. You know I have a certain weakness for mechanism, and
I was inclined to linger among these; the more so as for the most part
they had the interest of puzzles, and I could make only the vaguest
guesses at what they were for. I fancied that if I could solve their
puzzles I should find myself in possession of powers that might be of
use against the Morlocks.

“Suddenly Weena came very close to my side. So suddenly that she
startled me. Had it not been for her I do not think I should have
noticed that the floor of the gallery sloped at all. [Footnote: It may
be, of course, that the floor did not slope, but that the museum was
built into the side of a hill.—ED.] The end I had come in at was quite
above ground, and was lit by rare slit-like windows. As you went down
the length, the ground came up against these windows, until at last
there was a pit like the ‘area‘ of a London house before each, and only
a narrow line of daylight at the top. I went slowly along, puzzling
about the machines, and had been too intent upon them to notice the
gradual diminution of the light, until Weena’s increasing apprehensions
drew my attention. Then I saw that the gallery ran down at last into a
thick darkness. I hesitated, and then, as I looked round me, I saw that
the dust was less abundant and its surface less even. Further away
towards the dimness, it appeared to be broken by a number of small
narrow footprints. My sense of the immediate presence of the Morlocks
revived at that. I felt that I was wasting my time in the academic
examination of machinery. I called to mind that it was already far
advanced in the afternoon, and that I had still no weapon, no refuge,
and no means of making a fire. And then down in the remote blackness of
the gallery I heard a peculiar pattering, and the same odd noises I had
heard down the well.

“I took Weena’s hand. Then, struck with a sudden idea, I left her and
turned to a machine from which projected a lever not unlike those in a
signal-box. Clambering upon the stand, and grasping this lever in my
hands, I put all my weight upon it sideways. Suddenly Weena, deserted
in the central aisle, began to whimper. I had judged the strength of
the lever pretty correctly, for it snapped after a minute’s strain, and
I rejoined her with a mace in my hand more than sufficient, I judged,
for any Morlock skull I might encounter. And I longed very much to kill
a Morlock or so. Very inhuman, you may think, to want to go killing
one’s own descendants! But it was impossible, somehow, to feel any
humanity in the things. Only my disinclination to leave Weena, and a
persuasion that if I began to slake my thirst for murder my Time
Machine might suffer, restrained me from going straight down the
gallery and killing the brutes I heard.

“Well, mace in one hand and Weena in the other, I went out of that
gallery and into another and still larger one, which at the first
glance reminded me of a military chapel hung with tattered flags. The
brown and charred rags that hung from the sides of it, I presently
recognised as the decaying vestiges of books. They had long since
dropped to pieces, and every semblance of print had left them. But here
and there were warped boards and cracked metallic clasps that told the
tale well enough. Had I been a literary man I might, perhaps, have
moralised upon the futility of all ambition. But as it was, the thing
that struck me with keenest force was the enormous waste of labour to
which this sombre wilderness of rotting paper testified. At the time I
will confess that I thought chiefly of the _Philosophical Transactions_
and my own seventeen papers upon physical optics.

“Then, going up a broad staircase, we came to what may once have been a
gallery of technical chemistry. And here I had not a little hope of
useful discoveries. Except at one end where the roof had collapsed,
this gallery was well preserved. I went eagerly to every unbroken case.
And at last, in one of the really air-tight cases, I found a box of
matches. Very eagerly I tried them. They were perfectly good. They were
not even damp. I turned to Weena. ‘Dance,’ I cried to her in her own
tongue. For now I had a weapon indeed against the horrible creatures we
feared. And so, in that derelict museum, upon the thick soft carpeting
of dust, to Weena’s huge delight, I solemnly performed a kind of
composite dance, whistling _The Land of the Leal_ as cheerfully as I
could. In part it was a modest _cancan_, in part a step dance, in part
a skirt dance (so far as my tail-coat permitted), and in part original.
For I am naturally inventive, as you know.

“Now, I still think that for this box of matches to have escaped the
wear of time for immemorial years was a most strange, as for me it was
a most fortunate, thing. Yet, oddly enough, I found a far unlikelier
substance, and that was camphor. I found it in a sealed jar, that by
chance, I suppose, had been really hermetically sealed. I fancied at
first that it was paraffin wax, and smashed the glass accordingly. But
the odour of camphor was unmistakable. In the universal decay this
volatile substance had chanced to survive, perhaps through many
thousands of centuries. It reminded me of a sepia painting I had once
seen done from the ink of a fossil Belemnite that must have perished
and become fossilised millions of years ago. I was about to throw it
away, but I remembered that it was inflammable and burnt with a good
bright flame—was, in fact, an excellent candle—and I put it in my
pocket. I found no explosives, however, nor any means of breaking down
the bronze doors. As yet my iron crowbar was the most helpful thing I
had chanced upon. Nevertheless I left that gallery greatly elated.

“I cannot tell you all the story of that long afternoon. It would
require a great effort of memory to recall my explorations in at all
the proper order. I remember a long gallery of rusting stands of arms,
and how I hesitated between my crowbar and a hatchet or a sword. I
could not carry both, however, and my bar of iron promised best against
the bronze gates. There were numbers of guns, pistols, and rifles. The
most were masses of rust, but many were of some new metal, and still
fairly sound. But any cartridges or powder there may once have been had
rotted into dust. One corner I saw was charred and shattered; perhaps,
I thought, by an explosion among the specimens. In another place was a
vast array of idols—Polynesian, Mexican, Grecian, Phœnician, every
country on earth, I should think. And here, yielding to an irresistible
impulse, I wrote my name upon the nose of a steatite monster from South
America that particularly took my fancy.

“As the evening drew on, my interest waned. I went through gallery
after gallery, dusty, silent, often ruinous, the exhibits sometimes
mere heaps of rust and lignite, sometimes fresher. In one place I
suddenly found myself near the model of a tin mine, and then by the
merest accident I discovered, in an air-tight case, two dynamite
cartridges! I shouted ‘Eureka!’ and smashed the case with joy. Then
came a doubt. I hesitated. Then, selecting a little side gallery, I
made my essay. I never felt such a disappointment as I did in waiting
five, ten, fifteen minutes for an explosion that never came. Of course
the things were dummies, as I might have guessed from their presence. I
really believe that had they not been so, I should have rushed off
incontinently and blown Sphinx, bronze doors, and (as it proved) my
chances of finding the Time Machine, all together into non-existence.

“It was after that, I think, that we came to a little open court within
the palace. It was turfed, and had three fruit-trees. So we rested and
refreshed ourselves. Towards sunset I began to consider our position.
Night was creeping upon us, and my inaccessible hiding-place had still
to be found. But that troubled me very little now. I had in my
possession a thing that was, perhaps, the best of all defences against
the Morlocks—I had matches! I had the camphor in my pocket, too, if a
blaze were needed. It seemed to me that the best thing we could do
would be to pass the night in the open, protected by a fire. In the
morning there was the getting of the Time Machine. Towards that, as
yet, I had only my iron mace. But now, with my growing knowledge, I
felt very differently towards those bronze doors. Up to this, I had
refrained from forcing them, largely because of the mystery on the
other side. They had never impressed me as being very strong, and I
hoped to find my bar of iron not altogether inadequate for the work.




 XII.
 In the Darkness


“We emerged from the Palace while the sun was still in part above the
horizon. I was determined to reach the White Sphinx early the next
morning, and ere the dusk I purposed pushing through the woods that had
stopped me on the previous journey. My plan was to go as far as
possible that night, and then, building a fire, to sleep in the
protection of its glare. Accordingly, as we went along I gathered any
sticks or dried grass I saw, and presently had my arms full of such
litter. Thus loaded, our progress was slower than I had anticipated,
and besides Weena was tired. And I, also, began to suffer from
sleepiness too; so that it was full night before we reached the wood.
Upon the shrubby hill of its edge Weena would have stopped, fearing the
darkness before us; but a singular sense of impending calamity, that
should indeed have served me as a warning, drove me onward. I had been
without sleep for a night and two days, and I was feverish and
irritable. I felt sleep coming upon me, and the Morlocks with it.

“While we hesitated, among the black bushes behind us, and dim against
their blackness, I saw three crouching figures. There was scrub and
long grass all about us, and I did not feel safe from their insidious
approach. The forest, I calculated, was rather less than a mile across.
If we could get through it to the bare hillside, there, as it seemed to
me, was an altogether safer resting-place; I thought that with my
matches and my camphor I could contrive to keep my path illuminated
through the woods. Yet it was evident that if I was to flourish matches
with my hands I should have to abandon my firewood; so, rather
reluctantly, I put it down. And then it came into my head that I would
amaze our friends behind by lighting it. I was to discover the
atrocious folly of this proceeding, but it came to my mind as an
ingenious move for covering our retreat.

“I don’t know if you have ever thought what a rare thing flame must be
in the absence of man and in a temperate climate. The sun’s heat is
rarely strong enough to burn, even when it is focused by dewdrops, as
is sometimes the case in more tropical districts. Lightning may blast
and blacken, but it rarely gives rise to widespread fire. Decaying
vegetation may occasionally smoulder with the heat of its fermentation,
but this rarely results in flame. In this decadence, too, the art of
fire-making had been forgotten on the earth. The red tongues that went
licking up my heap of wood were an altogether new and strange thing to
Weena.

“She wanted to run to it and play with it. I believe she would have
cast herself into it had I not restrained her. But I caught her up, and
in spite of her struggles, plunged boldly before me into the wood. For
a little way the glare of my fire lit the path. Looking back presently,
I could see, through the crowded stems, that from my heap of sticks the
blaze had spread to some bushes adjacent, and a curved line of fire was
creeping up the grass of the hill. I laughed at that, and turned again
to the dark trees before me. It was very black, and Weena clung to me
convulsively, but there was still, as my eyes grew accustomed to the
darkness, sufficient light for me to avoid the stems. Overhead it was
simply black, except where a gap of remote blue sky shone down upon us
here and there. I lit none of my matches because I had no hand free.
Upon my left arm I carried my little one, in my right hand I had my
iron bar.

“For some way I heard nothing but the crackling twigs under my feet,
the faint rustle of the breeze above, and my own breathing and the
throb of the blood-vessels in my ears. Then I seemed to know of a
pattering behind me. I pushed on grimly. The pattering grew more
distinct, and then I caught the same queer sound and voices I had heard
in the Underworld. There were evidently several of the Morlocks, and
they were closing in upon me. Indeed, in another minute I felt a tug at
my coat, then something at my arm. And Weena shivered violently, and
became quite still.

“It was time for a match. But to get one I must put her down. I did so,
and, as I fumbled with my pocket, a struggle began in the darkness
about my knees, perfectly silent on her part and with the same peculiar
cooing sounds from the Morlocks. Soft little hands, too, were creeping
over my coat and back, touching even my neck. Then the match scratched
and fizzed. I held it flaring, and saw the white backs of the Morlocks
in flight amid the trees. I hastily took a lump of camphor from my
pocket, and prepared to light it as soon as the match should wane. Then
I looked at Weena. She was lying clutching my feet and quite
motionless, with her face to the ground. With a sudden fright I stooped
to her. She seemed scarcely to breathe. I lit the block of camphor and
flung it to the ground, and as it split and flared up and drove back
the Morlocks and the shadows, I knelt down and lifted her. The wood
behind seemed full of the stir and murmur of a great company!

“She seemed to have fainted. I put her carefully upon my shoulder and
rose to push on, and then there came a horrible realisation. In
manœuvring with my matches and Weena, I had turned myself about several
times, and now I had not the faintest idea in what direction lay my
path. For all I knew, I might be facing back towards the Palace of
Green Porcelain. I found myself in a cold sweat. I had to think rapidly
what to do. I determined to build a fire and encamp where we were. I
put Weena, still motionless, down upon a turfy bole, and very hastily,
as my first lump of camphor waned, I began collecting sticks and
leaves. Here and there out of the darkness round me the Morlocks’ eyes
shone like carbuncles.

“The camphor flickered and went out. I lit a match, and as I did so,
two white forms that had been approaching Weena dashed hastily away.
One was so blinded by the light that he came straight for me, and I
felt his bones grind under the blow of my fist. He gave a whoop of
dismay, staggered a little way, and fell down. I lit another piece of
camphor, and went on gathering my bonfire. Presently I noticed how dry
was some of the foliage above me, for since my arrival on the Time
Machine, a matter of a week, no rain had fallen. So, instead of casting
about among the trees for fallen twigs, I began leaping up and dragging
down branches. Very soon I had a choking smoky fire of green wood and
dry sticks, and could economise my camphor. Then I turned to where
Weena lay beside my iron mace. I tried what I could to revive her, but
she lay like one dead. I could not even satisfy myself whether or not
she breathed.

“Now, the smoke of the fire beat over towards me, and it must have made
me heavy of a sudden. Moreover, the vapour of camphor was in the air.
My fire would not need replenishing for an hour or so. I felt very
weary after my exertion, and sat down. The wood, too, was full of a
slumbrous murmur that I did not understand. I seemed just to nod and
open my eyes. But all was dark, and the Morlocks had their hands upon
me. Flinging off their clinging fingers I hastily felt in my pocket for
the match-box, and—it had gone! Then they gripped and closed with me
again. In a moment I knew what had happened. I had slept, and my fire
had gone out, and the bitterness of death came over my soul. The forest
seemed full of the smell of burning wood. I was caught by the neck, by
the hair, by the arms, and pulled down. It was indescribably horrible
in the darkness to feel all these soft creatures heaped upon me. I felt
as if I was in a monstrous spider’s web. I was overpowered, and went
down. I felt little teeth nipping at my neck. I rolled over, and as I
did so my hand came against my iron lever. It gave me strength. I
struggled up, shaking the human rats from me, and, holding the bar
short, I thrust where I judged their faces might be. I could feel the
succulent giving of flesh and bone under my blows, and for a moment I
was free.

“The strange exultation that so often seems to accompany hard fighting
came upon me. I knew that both I and Weena were lost, but I determined
to make the Morlocks pay for their meat. I stood with my back to a
tree, swinging the iron bar before me. The whole wood was full of the
stir and cries of them. A minute passed. Their voices seemed to rise to
a higher pitch of excitement, and their movements grew faster. Yet none
came within reach. I stood glaring at the blackness. Then suddenly came
hope. What if the Morlocks were afraid? And close on the heels of that
came a strange thing. The darkness seemed to grow luminous. Very dimly
I began to see the Morlocks about me—three battered at my feet—and then
I recognised, with incredulous surprise, that the others were running,
in an incessant stream, as it seemed, from behind me, and away through
the wood in front. And their backs seemed no longer white, but reddish.
As I stood agape, I saw a little red spark go drifting across a gap of
starlight between the branches, and vanish. And at that I understood
the smell of burning wood, the slumbrous murmur that was growing now
into a gusty roar, the red glow, and the Morlocks’ flight.

“Stepping out from behind my tree and looking back, I saw, through the
black pillars of the nearer trees, the flames of the burning forest. It
was my first fire coming after me. With that I looked for Weena, but
she was gone. The hissing and crackling behind me, the explosive thud
as each fresh tree burst into flame, left little time for reflection.
My iron bar still gripped, I followed in the Morlocks’ path. It was a
close race. Once the flames crept forward so swiftly on my right as I
ran that I was outflanked and had to strike off to the left. But at
last I emerged upon a small open space, and as I did so, a Morlock came
blundering towards me, and past me, and went on straight into the fire!

“And now I was to see the most weird and horrible thing, I think, of
all that I beheld in that future age. This whole space was as bright as
day with the reflection of the fire. In the centre was a hillock or
tumulus, surmounted by a scorched hawthorn. Beyond this was another arm
of the burning forest, with yellow tongues already writhing from it,
completely encircling the space with a fence of fire. Upon the hillside
were some thirty or forty Morlocks, dazzled by the light and heat, and
blundering hither and thither against each other in their bewilderment.
At first I did not realise their blindness, and struck furiously at
them with my bar, in a frenzy of fear, as they approached me, killing
one and crippling several more. But when I had watched the gestures of
one of them groping under the hawthorn against the red sky, and heard
their moans, I was assured of their absolute helplessness and misery in
the glare, and I struck no more of them.

“Yet every now and then one would come straight towards me, setting
loose a quivering horror that made me quick to elude him. At one time
the flames died down somewhat, and I feared the foul creatures would
presently be able to see me. I was thinking of beginning the fight by
killing some of them before this should happen; but the fire burst out
again brightly, and I stayed my hand. I walked about the hill among
them and avoided them, looking for some trace of Weena. But Weena was
gone.

“At last I sat down on the summit of the hillock, and watched this
strange incredible company of blind things groping to and fro, and
making uncanny noises to each other, as the glare of the fire beat on
them. The coiling uprush of smoke streamed across the sky, and through
the rare tatters of that red canopy, remote as though they belonged to
another universe, shone the little stars. Two or three Morlocks came
blundering into me, and I drove them off with blows of my fists,
trembling as I did so.

“For the most part of that night I was persuaded it was a nightmare. I
bit myself and screamed in a passionate desire to awake. I beat the
ground with my hands, and got up and sat down again, and wandered here
and there, and again sat down. Then I would fall to rubbing my eyes and
calling upon God to let me awake. Thrice I saw Morlocks put their heads
down in a kind of agony and rush into the flames. But, at last, above
the subsiding red of the fire, above the streaming masses of black
smoke and the whitening and blackening tree stumps, and the diminishing
numbers of these dim creatures, came the white light of the day.

“I searched again for traces of Weena, but there were none. It was
plain that they had left her poor little body in the forest. I cannot
describe how it relieved me to think that it had escaped the awful fate
to which it seemed destined. As I thought of that, I was almost moved
to begin a massacre of the helpless abominations about me, but I
contained myself. The hillock, as I have said, was a kind of island in
the forest. From its summit I could now make out through a haze of
smoke the Palace of Green Porcelain, and from that I could get my
bearings for the White Sphinx. And so, leaving the remnant of these
damned souls still going hither and thither and moaning, as the day
grew clearer, I tied some grass about my feet and limped on across
smoking ashes and among black stems that still pulsated internally with
fire, towards the hiding-place of the Time Machine. I walked slowly,
for I was almost exhausted, as well as lame, and I felt the intensest
wretchedness for the horrible death of little Weena. It seemed an
overwhelming calamity. Now, in this old familiar room, it is more like
the sorrow of a dream than an actual loss. But that morning it left me
absolutely lonely again—terribly alone. I began to think of this house
of mine, of this fireside, of some of you, and with such thoughts came
a longing that was pain.

“But, as I walked over the smoking ashes under the bright morning sky,
I made a discovery. In my trouser pocket were still some loose matches.
The box must have leaked before it was lost.




 XIII.
 The Trap of the White Sphinx


“About eight or nine in the morning I came to the same seat of yellow
metal from which I had viewed the world upon the evening of my arrival.
I thought of my hasty conclusions upon that evening and could not
refrain from laughing bitterly at my confidence. Here was the same
beautiful scene, the same abundant foliage, the same splendid palaces
and magnificent ruins, the same silver river running between its
fertile banks. The gay robes of the beautiful people moved hither and
thither among the trees. Some were bathing in exactly the place where I
had saved Weena, and that suddenly gave me a keen stab of pain. And
like blots upon the landscape rose the cupolas above the ways to the
Underworld. I understood now what all the beauty of the Overworld
people covered. Very pleasant was their day, as pleasant as the day of
the cattle in the field. Like the cattle, they knew of no enemies and
provided against no needs. And their end was the same.

“I grieved to think how brief the dream of the human intellect had
been. It had committed suicide. It had set itself steadfastly towards
comfort and ease, a balanced society with security and permanency as
its watchword, it had attained its hopes—to come to this at last. Once,
life and property must have reached almost absolute safety. The rich
had been assured of his wealth and comfort, the toiler assured of his
life and work. No doubt in that perfect world there had been no
unemployed problem, no social question left unsolved. And a great quiet
had followed.

“It is a law of nature we overlook, that intellectual versatility is
the compensation for change, danger, and trouble. An animal perfectly
in harmony with its environment is a perfect mechanism. Nature never
appeals to intelligence until habit and instinct are useless. There is
no intelligence where there is no change and no need of change. Only
those animals partake of intelligence that have to meet a huge variety
of needs and dangers.

“So, as I see it, the Upperworld man had drifted towards his feeble
prettiness, and the Underworld to mere mechanical industry. But that
perfect state had lacked one thing even for mechanical
perfection—absolute permanency. Apparently as time went on, the feeding
of an Underworld, however it was effected, had become disjointed.
Mother Necessity, who had been staved off for a few thousand years,
came back again, and she began below. The Underworld being in contact
with machinery, which, however perfect, still needs some little thought
outside habit, had probably retained perforce rather more initiative,
if less of every other human character, than the Upper. And when other
meat failed them, they turned to what old habit had hitherto forbidden.
So I say I saw it in my last view of the world of Eight Hundred and Two
Thousand Seven Hundred and One. It may be as wrong an explanation as
mortal wit could invent. It is how the thing shaped itself to me, and
as that I give it to you.

“After the fatigues, excitements, and terrors of the past days, and in
spite of my grief, this seat and the tranquil view and the warm
sunlight were very pleasant. I was very tired and sleepy, and soon my
theorising passed into dozing. Catching myself at that, I took my own
hint, and spreading myself out upon the turf I had a long and
refreshing sleep.

“I awoke a little before sunsetting. I now felt safe against being
caught napping by the Morlocks, and, stretching myself, I came on down
the hill towards the White Sphinx. I had my crowbar in one hand, and
the other hand played with the matches in my pocket.

“And now came a most unexpected thing. As I approached the pedestal of
the sphinx I found the bronze valves were open. They had slid down into
grooves.

“At that I stopped short before them, hesitating to enter.

“Within was a small apartment, and on a raised place in the corner of
this was the Time Machine. I had the small levers in my pocket. So
here, after all my elaborate preparations for the siege of the White
Sphinx, was a meek surrender. I threw my iron bar away, almost sorry
not to use it.

“A sudden thought came into my head as I stooped towards the portal.
For once, at least, I grasped the mental operations of the Morlocks.
Suppressing a strong inclination to laugh, I stepped through the bronze
frame and up to the Time Machine. I was surprised to find it had been
carefully oiled and cleaned. I have suspected since that the Morlocks
had even partially taken it to pieces while trying in their dim way to
grasp its purpose.

“Now as I stood and examined it, finding a pleasure in the mere touch
of the contrivance, the thing I had expected happened. The bronze
panels suddenly slid up and struck the frame with a clang. I was in the
dark—trapped. So the Morlocks thought. At that I chuckled gleefully.

“I could already hear their murmuring laughter as they came towards me.
Very calmly I tried to strike the match. I had only to fix on the
levers and depart then like a ghost. But I had overlooked one little
thing. The matches were of that abominable kind that light only on the
box.

“You may imagine how all my calm vanished. The little brutes were close
upon me. One touched me. I made a sweeping blow in the dark at them
with the levers, and began to scramble into the saddle of the machine.
Then came one hand upon me and then another. Then I had simply to fight
against their persistent fingers for my levers, and at the same time
feel for the studs over which these fitted. One, indeed, they almost
got away from me. As it slipped from my hand, I had to butt in the dark
with my head—I could hear the Morlock’s skull ring—to recover it. It
was a nearer thing than the fight in the forest, I think, this last
scramble.

“But at last the lever was fixed and pulled over. The clinging hands
slipped from me. The darkness presently fell from my eyes. I found
myself in the same grey light and tumult I have already described.




 XIV.
 The Further Vision


“I have already told you of the sickness and confusion that comes with
time travelling. And this time I was not seated properly in the saddle,
but sideways and in an unstable fashion. For an indefinite time I clung
to the machine as it swayed and vibrated, quite unheeding how I went,
and when I brought myself to look at the dials again I was amazed to
find where I had arrived. One dial records days, and another thousands
of days, another millions of days, and another thousands of millions.
Now, instead of reversing the levers, I had pulled them over so as to
go forward with them, and when I came to look at these indicators I
found that the thousands hand was sweeping round as fast as the seconds
hand of a watch—into futurity.

“As I drove on, a peculiar change crept over the appearance of things.
The palpitating greyness grew darker; then—though I was still
travelling with prodigious velocity—the blinking succession of day and
night, which was usually indicative of a slower pace, returned, and
grew more and more marked. This puzzled me very much at first. The
alternations of night and day grew slower and slower, and so did the
passage of the sun across the sky, until they seemed to stretch through
centuries. At last a steady twilight brooded over the earth, a twilight
only broken now and then when a comet glared across the darkling sky.
The band of light that had indicated the sun had long since
disappeared; for the sun had ceased to set—it simply rose and fell in
the west, and grew ever broader and more red. All trace of the moon had
vanished. The circling of the stars, growing slower and slower, had
given place to creeping points of light. At last, some time before I
stopped, the sun, red and very large, halted motionless upon the
horizon, a vast dome glowing with a dull heat, and now and then
suffering a momentary extinction. At one time it had for a little while
glowed more brilliantly again, but it speedily reverted to its sullen
red heat. I perceived by this slowing down of its rising and setting
that the work of the tidal drag was done. The earth had come to rest
with one face to the sun, even as in our own time the moon faces the
earth. Very cautiously, for I remembered my former headlong fall, I
began to reverse my motion. Slower and slower went the circling hands
until the thousands one seemed motionless and the daily one was no
longer a mere mist upon its scale. Still slower, until the dim outlines
of a desolate beach grew visible.

“I stopped very gently and sat upon the Time Machine, looking round.
The sky was no longer blue. North-eastward it was inky black, and out
of the blackness shone brightly and steadily the pale white stars.
Overhead it was a deep Indian red and starless, and south-eastward it
grew brighter to a glowing scarlet where, cut by the horizon, lay the
huge hull of the sun, red and motionless. The rocks about me were of a
harsh reddish colour, and all the trace of life that I could see at
first was the intensely green vegetation that covered every projecting
point on their south-eastern face. It was the same rich green that one
sees on forest moss or on the lichen in caves: plants which like these
grow in a perpetual twilight.

“The machine was standing on a sloping beach. The sea stretched away to
the south-west, to rise into a sharp bright horizon against the wan
sky. There were no breakers and no waves, for not a breath of wind was
stirring. Only a slight oily swell rose and fell like a gentle
breathing, and showed that the eternal sea was still moving and living.
And along the margin where the water sometimes broke was a thick
incrustation of salt—pink under the lurid sky. There was a sense of
oppression in my head, and I noticed that I was breathing very fast.
The sensation reminded me of my only experience of mountaineering, and
from that I judged the air to be more rarefied than it is now.

“Far away up the desolate slope I heard a harsh scream, and saw a thing
like a huge white butterfly go slanting and fluttering up into the sky
and, circling, disappear over some low hillocks beyond. The sound of
its voice was so dismal that I shivered and seated myself more firmly
upon the machine. Looking round me again, I saw that, quite near, what
I had taken to be a reddish mass of rock was moving slowly towards me.
Then I saw the thing was really a monstrous crab-like creature. Can you
imagine a crab as large as yonder table, with its many legs moving
slowly and uncertainly, its big claws swaying, its long antennæ, like
carters’ whips, waving and feeling, and its stalked eyes gleaming at
you on either side of its metallic front? Its back was corrugated and
ornamented with ungainly bosses, and a greenish incrustation blotched
it here and there. I could see the many palps of its complicated mouth
flickering and feeling as it moved.

“As I stared at this sinister apparition crawling towards me, I felt a
tickling on my cheek as though a fly had lighted there. I tried to
brush it away with my hand, but in a moment it returned, and almost
immediately came another by my ear. I struck at this, and caught
something threadlike. It was drawn swiftly out of my hand. With a
frightful qualm, I turned, and I saw that I had grasped the antenna of
another monster crab that stood just behind me. Its evil eyes were
wriggling on their stalks, its mouth was all alive with appetite, and
its vast ungainly claws, smeared with an algal slime, were descending
upon me. In a moment my hand was on the lever, and I had placed a month
between myself and these monsters. But I was still on the same beach,
and I saw them distinctly now as soon as I stopped. Dozens of them
seemed to be crawling here and there, in the sombre light, among the
foliated sheets of intense green.

“I cannot convey the sense of abominable desolation that hung over the
world. The red eastern sky, the northward blackness, the salt Dead Sea,
the stony beach crawling with these foul, slow-stirring monsters, the
uniform poisonous-looking green of the lichenous plants, the thin air
that hurts one’s lungs: all contributed to an appalling effect. I moved
on a hundred years, and there was the same red sun—a little larger, a
little duller—the same dying sea, the same chill air, and the same
crowd of earthy crustacea creeping in and out among the green weed and
the red rocks. And in the westward sky, I saw a curved pale line like a
vast new moon.

“So I travelled, stopping ever and again, in great strides of a
thousand years or more, drawn on by the mystery of the earth’s fate,
watching with a strange fascination the sun grow larger and duller in
the westward sky, and the life of the old earth ebb away. At last, more
than thirty million years hence, the huge red-hot dome of the sun had
come to obscure nearly a tenth part of the darkling heavens. Then I
stopped once more, for the crawling multitude of crabs had disappeared,
and the red beach, save for its livid green liverworts and lichens,
seemed lifeless. And now it was flecked with white. A bitter cold
assailed me. Rare white flakes ever and again came eddying down. To the
north-eastward, the glare of snow lay under the starlight of the sable
sky, and I could see an undulating crest of hillocks pinkish white.
There were fringes of ice along the sea margin, with drifting masses
farther out; but the main expanse of that salt ocean, all bloody under
the eternal sunset, was still unfrozen.

“I looked about me to see if any traces of animal life remained. A
certain indefinable apprehension still kept me in the saddle of the
machine. But I saw nothing moving, in earth or sky or sea. The green
slime on the rocks alone testified that life was not extinct. A shallow
sandbank had appeared in the sea and the water had receded from the
beach. I fancied I saw some black object flopping about upon this bank,
but it became motionless as I looked at it, and I judged that my eye
had been deceived, and that the black object was merely a rock. The
stars in the sky were intensely bright and seemed to me to twinkle very
little.

“Suddenly I noticed that the circular westward outline of the sun had
changed; that a concavity, a bay, had appeared in the curve. I saw this
grow larger. For a minute perhaps I stared aghast at this blackness
that was creeping over the day, and then I realised that an eclipse was
beginning. Either the moon or the planet Mercury was passing across the
sun’s disk. Naturally, at first I took it to be the moon, but there is
much to incline me to believe that what I really saw was the transit of
an inner planet passing very near to the earth.

“The darkness grew apace; a cold wind began to blow in freshening gusts
from the east, and the showering white flakes in the air increased in
number. From the edge of the sea came a ripple and whisper. Beyond
these lifeless sounds the world was silent. Silent? It would be hard to
convey the stillness of it. All the sounds of man, the bleating of
sheep, the cries of birds, the hum of insects, the stir that makes the
background of our lives—all that was over. As the darkness thickened,
the eddying flakes grew more abundant, dancing before my eyes; and the
cold of the air more intense. At last, one by one, swiftly, one after
the other, the white peaks of the distant hills vanished into
blackness. The breeze rose to a moaning wind. I saw the black central
shadow of the eclipse sweeping towards me. In another moment the pale
stars alone were visible. All else was rayless obscurity. The sky was
absolutely black.

“A horror of this great darkness came on me. The cold, that smote to my
marrow, and the pain I felt in breathing, overcame me. I shivered, and
a deadly nausea seized me. Then like a red-hot bow in the sky appeared
the edge of the sun. I got off the machine to recover myself. I felt
giddy and incapable of facing the return journey. As I stood sick and
confused I saw again the moving thing upon the shoal—there was no
mistake now that it was a moving thing—against the red water of the
sea. It was a round thing, the size of a football perhaps, or, it may
be, bigger, and tentacles trailed down from it; it seemed black against
the weltering blood-red water, and it was hopping fitfully about. Then
I felt I was fainting. But a terrible dread of lying helpless in that
remote and awful twilight sustained me while I clambered upon the
saddle.




 XV.
 The Time Traveller’s Return


“So I came back. For a long time I must have been insensible upon the
machine. The blinking succession of the days and nights was resumed,
the sun got golden again, the sky blue. I breathed with greater
freedom. The fluctuating contours of the land ebbed and flowed. The
hands spun backward upon the dials. At last I saw again the dim shadows
of houses, the evidences of decadent humanity. These, too, changed and
passed, and others came. Presently, when the million dial was at zero,
I slackened speed. I began to recognise our own pretty and familiar
architecture, the thousands hand ran back to the starting-point, the
night and day flapped slower and slower. Then the old walls of the
laboratory came round me. Very gently, now, I slowed the mechanism
down.

“I saw one little thing that seemed odd to me. I think I have told you
that when I set out, before my velocity became very high, Mrs. Watchett
had walked across the room, travelling, as it seemed to me, like a
rocket. As I returned, I passed again across that minute when she
traversed the laboratory. But now her every motion appeared to be the
exact inversion of her previous ones. The door at the lower end opened,
and she glided quietly up the laboratory, back foremost, and
disappeared behind the door by which she had previously entered. Just
before that I seemed to see Hillyer for a moment; but he passed like a
flash.

“Then I stopped the machine, and saw about me again the old familiar
laboratory, my tools, my appliances just as I had left them. I got off
the thing very shakily, and sat down upon my bench. For several minutes
I trembled violently. Then I became calmer. Around me was my old
workshop again, exactly as it had been. I might have slept there, and
the whole thing have been a dream.

“And yet, not exactly! The thing had started from the south-east corner
of the laboratory. It had come to rest again in the north-west, against
the wall where you saw it. That gives you the exact distance from my
little lawn to the pedestal of the White Sphinx, into which the
Morlocks had carried my machine.

“For a time my brain went stagnant. Presently I got up and came through
the passage here, limping, because my heel was still painful, and
feeling sorely begrimed. I saw the _Pall Mall Gazette_ on the table by
the door. I found the date was indeed today, and looking at the
timepiece, saw the hour was almost eight o’clock. I heard your voices
and the clatter of plates. I hesitated—I felt so sick and weak. Then I
sniffed good wholesome meat, and opened the door on you. You know the
rest. I washed, and dined, and now I am telling you the story.




 XVI.
 After the Story


“I know,” he said, after a pause, “that all this will be absolutely
incredible to you, but to me the one incredible thing is that I am here
tonight in this old familiar room looking into your friendly faces and
telling you these strange adventures.” He looked at the Medical Man.
“No. I cannot expect you to believe it. Take it as a lie—or a prophecy.
Say I dreamed it in the workshop. Consider I have been speculating upon
the destinies of our race, until I have hatched this fiction. Treat my
assertion of its truth as a mere stroke of art to enhance its interest.
And taking it as a story, what do you think of it?”

He took up his pipe, and began, in his old accustomed manner, to tap
with it nervously upon the bars of the grate. There was a momentary
stillness. Then chairs began to creak and shoes to scrape upon the
carpet. I took my eyes off the Time Traveller’s face, and looked round
at his audience. They were in the dark, and little spots of colour swam
before them. The Medical Man seemed absorbed in the contemplation of
our host. The Editor was looking hard at the end of his cigar—the
sixth. The Journalist fumbled for his watch. The others, as far as I
remember, were motionless.

The Editor stood up with a sigh. “What a pity it is you’re not a writer
of stories!” he said, putting his hand on the Time Traveller’s
shoulder.

“You don’t believe it?”

“Well——”

“I thought not.”

The Time Traveller turned to us. “Where are the matches?” he said. He
lit one and spoke over his pipe, puffing. “To tell you the truth... I
hardly believe it myself..... And yet...”

His eye fell with a mute inquiry upon the withered white flowers upon
the little table. Then he turned over the hand holding his pipe, and I
saw he was looking at some half-healed scars on his knuckles.

The Medical Man rose, came to the lamp, and examined the flowers. “The
gynæceum’s odd,” he said. The Psychologist leant forward to see,
holding out his hand for a specimen.

“I’m hanged if it isn’t a quarter to one,” said the Journalist. “How
shall we get home?”

“Plenty of cabs at the station,” said the Psychologist.

“It’s a curious thing,” said the Medical Man; “but I certainly don’t
know the natural order of these flowers. May I have them?”

The Time Traveller hesitated. Then suddenly: “Certainly not.”

“Where did you really get them?” said the Medical Man.

The Time Traveller put his hand to his head. He spoke like one who was
trying to keep hold of an idea that eluded him. “They were put into my
pocket by Weena, when I travelled into Time.” He stared round the room.
“I’m damned if it isn’t all going. This room and you and the atmosphere
of every day is too much for my memory. Did I ever make a Time Machine,
or a model of a Time Machine? Or is it all only a dream? They say life
is a dream, a precious poor dream at times—but I can’t stand another
that won’t fit. It’s madness. And where did the dream come from? … I
must look at that machine. If there is one!”

He caught up the lamp swiftly, and carried it, flaring red, through the
door into the corridor. We followed him. There in the flickering light
of the lamp was the machine sure enough, squat, ugly, and askew, a
thing of brass, ebony, ivory, and translucent glimmering quartz. Solid
to the touch—for I put out my hand and felt the rail of it—and with
brown spots and smears upon the ivory, and bits of grass and moss upon
the lower parts, and one rail bent awry.

The Time Traveller put the lamp down on the bench, and ran his hand
along the damaged rail. “It’s all right now,” he said. “The story I
told you was true. I’m sorry to have brought you out here in the cold.”
He took up the lamp, and, in an absolute silence, we returned to the
smoking-room.

He came into the hall with us and helped the Editor on with his coat.
The Medical Man looked into his face and, with a certain hesitation,
told him he was suffering from overwork, at which he laughed hugely. I
remember him standing in the open doorway, bawling good-night.

I shared a cab with the Editor. He thought the tale a “gaudy lie.” For
my own part I was unable to come to a conclusion. The story was so
fantastic and incredible, the telling so credible and sober. I lay
awake most of the night thinking about it. I determined to go next day
and see the Time Traveller again. I was told he was in the laboratory,
and being on easy terms in the house, I went up to him. The laboratory,
however, was empty. I stared for a minute at the Time Machine and put
out my hand and touched the lever. At that the squat
substantial-looking mass swayed like a bough shaken by the wind. Its
instability startled me extremely, and I had a queer reminiscence of
the childish days when I used to be forbidden to meddle. I came back
through the corridor. The Time Traveller met me in the smoking-room. He
was coming from the house. He had a small camera under one arm and a
knapsack under the other. He laughed when he saw me, and gave me an
elbow to shake. “I’m frightfully busy,” said he, “with that thing in
there.”

“But is it not some hoax?” I said. “Do you really travel through time?”

“Really and truly I do.” And he looked frankly into my eyes. He
hesitated. His eye wandered about the room. “I only want half an hour,”
he said. “I know why you came, and it’s awfully good of you. There’s
some magazines here. If you’ll stop to lunch I’ll prove you this time
travelling up to the hilt, specimens and all. If you’ll forgive my
leaving you now?”

I consented, hardly comprehending then the full import of his words,
and he nodded and went on down the corridor. I heard the door of the
laboratory slam, seated myself in a chair, and took up a daily paper.
What was he going to do before lunch-time? Then suddenly I was reminded
by an advertisement that I had promised to meet Richardson, the
publisher, at two. I looked at my watch, and saw that I could barely
save that engagement. I got up and went down the passage to tell the
Time Traveller.

As I took hold of the handle of the door I heard an exclamation, oddly
truncated at the end, and a click and a thud. A gust of air whirled
round me as I opened the door, and from within came the sound of broken
glass falling on the floor. The Time Traveller was not there. I seemed
to see a ghostly, indistinct figure sitting in a whirling mass of black
and brass for a moment—a figure so transparent that the bench behind
with its sheets of drawings was absolutely distinct; but this phantasm
vanished as I rubbed my eyes. The Time Machine had gone. Save for a
subsiding stir of dust, the further end of the laboratory was empty. A
pane of the skylight had, apparently, just been blown in.

I felt an unreasonable amazement. I knew that something strange had
happened, and for the moment could not distinguish what the strange
thing might be. As I stood staring, the door into the garden opened,
and the man-servant appeared.

We looked at each other. Then ideas began to come. “Has Mr. —— gone out
that way?” said I.

“No, sir. No one has come out this way. I was expecting to find him
here.”

At that I understood. At the risk of disappointing Richardson I stayed
on, waiting for the Time Traveller; waiting for the second, perhaps
still stranger story, and the specimens and photographs he would bring
with him. But I am beginning now to fear that I must wait a lifetime.
The Time Traveller vanished three years ago. And, as everybody knows
now, he has never returned.




 Epilogue


One cannot choose but wonder. Will he ever return? It may be that he
swept back into the past, and fell among the blood-drinking, hairy
savages of the Age of Unpolished Stone; into the abysses of the
Cretaceous Sea; or among the grotesque saurians, the huge reptilian
brutes of the Jurassic times. He may even now—if I may use the
phrase—be wandering on some plesiosaurus-haunted Oolitic coral reef, or
beside the lonely saline seas of the Triassic Age. Or did he go
forward, into one of the nearer ages, in which men are still men, but
with the riddles of our own time answered and its wearisome problems
solved? Into the manhood of the race: for I, for my own part, cannot
think that these latter days of weak experiment, fragmentary theory,
and mutual discord are indeed man’s culminating time! I say, for my own
part. He, I know—for the question had been discussed among us long
before the Time Machine was made—thought but cheerlessly of the
Advancement of Mankind, and saw in the growing pile of civilisation
only a foolish heaping that must inevitably fall back upon and destroy
its makers in the end. If that is so, it remains for us to live as
though it were not so. But to me the future is still black and blank—is
a vast ignorance, lit at a few casual places by the memory of his
story. And I have by me, for my comfort, two strange white
flowers—shrivelled now, and brown and flat and brittle—to witness that
even when mind and strength had gone, gratitude and a mutual tenderness
still lived on in the heart of man.

BOOK ONE
THE COMING OF THE MARTIANS




I.
THE EVE OF THE WAR.


No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century
that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences
greater than man’s and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied
themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and
studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might
scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of
water. With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe
about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire
over matter. It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do
the same. No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources
of human danger, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life
upon them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to recall some of
the mental habits of those departed days. At most terrestrial men
fancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to
themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet across the
gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the
beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic,
regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their
plans against us. And early in the twentieth century came the great
disillusionment.

The planet Mars, I scarcely need remind the reader, revolves about the
sun at a mean distance of 140,000,000 miles, and the light and heat it
receives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world. It
must be, if the nebular hypothesis has any truth, older than our world;
and long before this earth ceased to be molten, life upon its surface
must have begun its course. The fact that it is scarcely one seventh of
the volume of the earth must have accelerated its cooling to the
temperature at which life could begin. It has air and water and all
that is necessary for the support of animated existence.

Yet so vain is man, and so blinded by his vanity, that no writer, up to
the very end of the nineteenth century, expressed any idea that
intelligent life might have developed there far, or indeed at all,
beyond its earthly level. Nor was it generally understood that since
Mars is older than our earth, with scarcely a quarter of the
superficial area and remoter from the sun, it necessarily follows that
it is not only more distant from time’s beginning but nearer its end.

The secular cooling that must someday overtake our planet has already
gone far indeed with our neighbour. Its physical condition is still
largely a mystery, but we know now that even in its equatorial region
the midday temperature barely approaches that of our coldest winter.
Its air is much more attenuated than ours, its oceans have shrunk until
they cover but a third of its surface, and as its slow seasons change
huge snowcaps gather and melt about either pole and periodically
inundate its temperate zones. That last stage of exhaustion, which to
us is still incredibly remote, has become a present-day problem for the
inhabitants of Mars. The immediate pressure of necessity has brightened
their intellects, enlarged their powers, and hardened their hearts. And
looking across space with instruments, and intelligences such as we
have scarcely dreamed of, they see, at its nearest distance only
35,000,000 of miles sunward of them, a morning star of hope, our own
warmer planet, green with vegetation and grey with water, with a cloudy
atmosphere eloquent of fertility, with glimpses through its drifting
cloud wisps of broad stretches of populous country and narrow,
navy-crowded seas.

And we men, the creatures who inhabit this earth, must be to them at
least as alien and lowly as are the monkeys and lemurs to us. The
intellectual side of man already admits that life is an incessant
struggle for existence, and it would seem that this too is the belief
of the minds upon Mars. Their world is far gone in its cooling and this
world is still crowded with life, but crowded only with what they
regard as inferior animals. To carry warfare sunward is, indeed, their
only escape from the destruction that, generation after generation,
creeps upon them.

And before we judge of them too harshly we must remember what ruthless
and utter destruction our own species has wrought, not only upon
animals, such as the vanished bison and the dodo, but upon its inferior
races. The Tasmanians, in spite of their human likeness, were entirely
swept out of existence in a war of extermination waged by European
immigrants, in the space of fifty years. Are we such apostles of mercy
as to complain if the Martians warred in the same spirit?

The Martians seem to have calculated their descent with amazing
subtlety—their mathematical learning is evidently far in excess of
ours—and to have carried out their preparations with a well-nigh
perfect unanimity. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have seen
the gathering trouble far back in the nineteenth century. Men like
Schiaparelli watched the red planet—it is odd, by-the-bye, that for
countless centuries Mars has been the star of war—but failed to
interpret the fluctuating appearances of the markings they mapped so
well. All that time the Martians must have been getting ready.

During the opposition of 1894 a great light was seen on the illuminated
part of the disk, first at the Lick Observatory, then by Perrotin of
Nice, and then by other observers. English readers heard of it first in
the issue of _Nature_ dated August 2. I am inclined to think that this
blaze may have been the casting of the huge gun, in the vast pit sunk
into their planet, from which their shots were fired at us. Peculiar
markings, as yet unexplained, were seen near the site of that outbreak
during the next two oppositions.

The storm burst upon us six years ago now. As Mars approached
opposition, Lavelle of Java set the wires of the astronomical exchange
palpitating with the amazing intelligence of a huge outbreak of
incandescent gas upon the planet. It had occurred towards midnight of
the twelfth; and the spectroscope, to which he had at once resorted,
indicated a mass of flaming gas, chiefly hydrogen, moving with an
enormous velocity towards this earth. This jet of fire had become
invisible about a quarter past twelve. He compared it to a colossal
puff of flame suddenly and violently squirted out of the planet, “as
flaming gases rushed out of a gun.”

A singularly appropriate phrase it proved. Yet the next day there was
nothing of this in the papers except a little note in the _Daily
Telegraph_, and the world went in ignorance of one of the gravest
dangers that ever threatened the human race. I might not have heard of
the eruption at all had I not met Ogilvy, the well-known astronomer, at
Ottershaw. He was immensely excited at the news, and in the excess of
his feelings invited me up to take a turn with him that night in a
scrutiny of the red planet.

In spite of all that has happened since, I still remember that vigil
very distinctly: the black and silent observatory, the shadowed lantern
throwing a feeble glow upon the floor in the corner, the steady ticking
of the clockwork of the telescope, the little slit in the roof—an
oblong profundity with the stardust streaked across it. Ogilvy moved
about, invisible but audible. Looking through the telescope, one saw a
circle of deep blue and the little round planet swimming in the field.
It seemed such a little thing, so bright and small and still, faintly
marked with transverse stripes, and slightly flattened from the perfect
round. But so little it was, so silvery warm—a pin’s head of light! It
was as if it quivered, but really this was the telescope vibrating with
the activity of the clockwork that kept the planet in view.

As I watched, the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller and to
advance and recede, but that was simply that my eye was tired. Forty
millions of miles it was from us—more than forty millions of miles of
void. Few people realise the immensity of vacancy in which the dust of
the material universe swims.

Near it in the field, I remember, were three faint points of light,
three telescopic stars infinitely remote, and all around it was the
unfathomable darkness of empty space. You know how that blackness looks
on a frosty starlight night. In a telescope it seems far profounder.
And invisible to me because it was so remote and small, flying swiftly
and steadily towards me across that incredible distance, drawing nearer
every minute by so many thousands of miles, came the Thing they were
sending us, the Thing that was to bring so much struggle and calamity
and death to the earth. I never dreamed of it then as I watched; no one
on earth dreamed of that unerring missile.

That night, too, there was another jetting out of gas from the distant
planet. I saw it. A reddish flash at the edge, the slightest projection
of the outline just as the chronometer struck midnight; and at that I
told Ogilvy and he took my place. The night was warm and I was thirsty,
and I went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the
darkness, to the little table where the siphon stood, while Ogilvy
exclaimed at the streamer of gas that came out towards us.

That night another invisible missile started on its way to the earth
from Mars, just a second or so under twenty-four hours after the first
one. I remember how I sat on the table there in the blackness, with
patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes. I wished I had a
light to smoke by, little suspecting the meaning of the minute gleam I
had seen and all that it would presently bring me. Ogilvy watched till
one, and then gave it up; and we lit the lantern and walked over to his
house. Down below in the darkness were Ottershaw and Chertsey and all
their hundreds of people, sleeping in peace.

He was full of speculation that night about the condition of Mars, and
scoffed at the vulgar idea of its having inhabitants who were
signalling us. His idea was that meteorites might be falling in a heavy
shower upon the planet, or that a huge volcanic explosion was in
progress. He pointed out to me how unlikely it was that organic
evolution had taken the same direction in the two adjacent planets.

“The chances against anything manlike on Mars are a million to one,” he
said.

Hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
about midnight, and again the night after; and so for ten nights, a
flame each night. Why the shots ceased after the tenth no one on earth
has attempted to explain. It may be the gases of the firing caused the
Martians inconvenience. Dense clouds of smoke or dust, visible through
a powerful telescope on earth as little grey, fluctuating patches,
spread through the clearness of the planet’s atmosphere and obscured
its more familiar features.

Even the daily papers woke up to the disturbances at last, and popular
notes appeared here, there, and everywhere concerning the volcanoes
upon Mars. The seriocomic periodical _Punch_, I remember, made a happy
use of it in the political cartoon. And, all unsuspected, those
missiles the Martians had fired at us drew earthward, rushing now at a
pace of many miles a second through the empty gulf of space, hour by
hour and day by day, nearer and nearer. It seems to me now almost
incredibly wonderful that, with that swift fate hanging over us, men
could go about their petty concerns as they did. I remember how
jubilant Markham was at securing a new photograph of the planet for the
illustrated paper he edited in those days. People in these latter times
scarcely realise the abundance and enterprise of our nineteenth-century
papers. For my own part, I was much occupied in learning to ride the
bicycle, and busy upon a series of papers discussing the probable
developments of moral ideas as civilisation progressed.

One night (the first missile then could scarcely have been 10,000,000
miles away) I went for a walk with my wife. It was starlight and I
explained the Signs of the Zodiac to her, and pointed out Mars, a
bright dot of light creeping zenithward, towards which so many
telescopes were pointed. It was a warm night. Coming home, a party of
excursionists from Chertsey or Isleworth passed us singing and playing
music. There were lights in the upper windows of the houses as the
people went to bed. From the railway station in the distance came the
sound of shunting trains, ringing and rumbling, softened almost into
melody by the distance. My wife pointed out to me the brightness of the
red, green, and yellow signal lights hanging in a framework against the
sky. It seemed so safe and tranquil.




II.
THE FALLING STAR.


Then came the night of the first falling star. It was seen early in the
morning, rushing over Winchester eastward, a line of flame high in the
atmosphere. Hundreds must have seen it, and taken it for an ordinary
falling star. Albin described it as leaving a greenish streak behind it
that glowed for some seconds. Denning, our greatest authority on
meteorites, stated that the height of its first appearance was about
ninety or one hundred miles. It seemed to him that it fell to earth
about one hundred miles east of him.

I was at home at that hour and writing in my study; and although my
French windows face towards Ottershaw and the blind was up (for I loved
in those days to look up at the night sky), I saw nothing of it. Yet
this strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space
must have fallen while I was sitting there, visible to me had I only
looked up as it passed. Some of those who saw its flight say it
travelled with a hissing sound. I myself heard nothing of that. Many
people in Berkshire, Surrey, and Middlesex must have seen the fall of
it, and, at most, have thought that another meteorite had descended. No
one seems to have troubled to look for the fallen mass that night.

But very early in the morning poor Ogilvy, who had seen the shooting
star and who was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere on the common
between Horsell, Ottershaw, and Woking, rose early with the idea of
finding it. Find it he did, soon after dawn, and not far from the
sand-pits. An enormous hole had been made by the impact of the
projectile, and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every
direction over the heath, forming heaps visible a mile and a half away.
The heather was on fire eastward, and a thin blue smoke rose against
the dawn.

The Thing itself lay almost entirely buried in sand, amidst the
scattered splinters of a fir tree it had shivered to fragments in its
descent. The uncovered part had the appearance of a huge cylinder,
caked over and its outline softened by a thick scaly dun-coloured
incrustation. It had a diameter of about thirty yards. He approached
the mass, surprised at the size and more so at the shape, since most
meteorites are rounded more or less completely. It was, however, still
so hot from its flight through the air as to forbid his near approach.
A stirring noise within its cylinder he ascribed to the unequal cooling
of its surface; for at that time it had not occurred to him that it
might be hollow.

He remained standing at the edge of the pit that the Thing had made for
itself, staring at its strange appearance, astonished chiefly at its
unusual shape and colour, and dimly perceiving even then some evidence
of design in its arrival. The early morning was wonderfully still, and
the sun, just clearing the pine trees towards Weybridge, was already
warm. He did not remember hearing any birds that morning, there was
certainly no breeze stirring, and the only sounds were the faint
movements from within the cindery cylinder. He was all alone on the
common.

Then suddenly he noticed with a start that some of the grey clinker,
the ashy incrustation that covered the meteorite, was falling off the
circular edge of the end. It was dropping off in flakes and raining
down upon the sand. A large piece suddenly came off and fell with a
sharp noise that brought his heart into his mouth.

For a minute he scarcely realised what this meant, and, although the
heat was excessive, he clambered down into the pit close to the bulk to
see the Thing more clearly. He fancied even then that the cooling of
the body might account for this, but what disturbed that idea was the
fact that the ash was falling only from the end of the cylinder.

And then he perceived that, very slowly, the circular top of the
cylinder was rotating on its body. It was such a gradual movement that
he discovered it only through noticing that a black mark that had been
near him five minutes ago was now at the other side of the
circumference. Even then he scarcely understood what this indicated,
until he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk
forward an inch or so. Then the thing came upon him in a flash. The
cylinder was artificial—hollow—with an end that screwed out! Something
within the cylinder was unscrewing the top!

“Good heavens!” said Ogilvy. “There’s a man in it—men in it! Half
roasted to death! Trying to escape!”

At once, with a quick mental leap, he linked the Thing with the flash
upon Mars.

The thought of the confined creature was so dreadful to him that he
forgot the heat and went forward to the cylinder to help turn. But
luckily the dull radiation arrested him before he could burn his hands
on the still-glowing metal. At that he stood irresolute for a moment,
then turned, scrambled out of the pit, and set off running wildly into
Woking. The time then must have been somewhere about six o’clock. He
met a waggoner and tried to make him understand, but the tale he told
and his appearance were so wild—his hat had fallen off in the pit—that
the man simply drove on. He was equally unsuccessful with the potman
who was just unlocking the doors of the public-house by Horsell Bridge.
The fellow thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful
attempt to shut him into the taproom. That sobered him a little; and
when he saw Henderson, the London journalist, in his garden, he called
over the palings and made himself understood.

“Henderson,” he called, “you saw that shooting star last night?”

“Well?” said Henderson.

“It’s out on Horsell Common now.”

“Good Lord!” said Henderson. “Fallen meteorite! That’s good.”

“But it’s something more than a meteorite. It’s a cylinder—an
artificial cylinder, man! And there’s something inside.”

Henderson stood up with his spade in his hand.

“What’s that?” he said. He was deaf in one ear.

Ogilvy told him all that he had seen. Henderson was a minute or so
taking it in. Then he dropped his spade, snatched up his jacket, and
came out into the road. The two men hurried back at once to the common,
and found the cylinder still lying in the same position. But now the
sounds inside had ceased, and a thin circle of bright metal showed
between the top and the body of the cylinder. Air was either entering
or escaping at the rim with a thin, sizzling sound.

They listened, rapped on the scaly burnt metal with a stick, and,
meeting with no response, they both concluded the man or men inside
must be insensible or dead.

Of course the two were quite unable to do anything. They shouted
consolation and promises, and went off back to the town again to get
help. One can imagine them, covered with sand, excited and disordered,
running up the little street in the bright sunlight just as the shop
folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their
bedroom windows. Henderson went into the railway station at once, in
order to telegraph the news to London. The newspaper articles had
prepared men’s minds for the reception of the idea.

By eight o’clock a number of boys and unemployed men had already
started for the common to see the “dead men from Mars.” That was the
form the story took. I heard of it first from my newspaper boy about a
quarter to nine when I went out to get my _Daily Chronicle_. I was
naturally startled, and lost no time in going out and across the
Ottershaw bridge to the sand-pits.




III.
ON HORSELL COMMON.


I found a little crowd of perhaps twenty people surrounding the huge
hole in which the cylinder lay. I have already described the appearance
of that colossal bulk, embedded in the ground. The turf and gravel
about it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion. No doubt its
impact had caused a flash of fire. Henderson and Ogilvy were not there.
I think they perceived that nothing was to be done for the present, and
had gone away to breakfast at Henderson’s house.

There were four or five boys sitting on the edge of the Pit, with their
feet dangling, and amusing themselves—until I stopped them—by throwing
stones at the giant mass. After I had spoken to them about it, they
began playing at “touch” in and out of the group of bystanders.

Among these were a couple of cyclists, a jobbing gardener I employed
sometimes, a girl carrying a baby, Gregg the butcher and his little
boy, and two or three loafers and golf caddies who were accustomed to
hang about the railway station. There was very little talking. Few of
the common people in England had anything but the vaguest astronomical
ideas in those days. Most of them were staring quietly at the big table
like end of the cylinder, which was still as Ogilvy and Henderson had
left it. I fancy the popular expectation of a heap of charred corpses
was disappointed at this inanimate bulk. Some went away while I was
there, and other people came. I clambered into the pit and fancied I
heard a faint movement under my feet. The top had certainly ceased to
rotate.

It was only when I got thus close to it that the strangeness of this
object was at all evident to me. At the first glance it was really no
more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the
road. Not so much so, indeed. It looked like a rusty gas float. It
required a certain amount of scientific education to perceive that the
grey scale of the Thing was no common oxide, that the yellowish-white
metal that gleamed in the crack between the lid and the cylinder had an
unfamiliar hue. “Extra-terrestrial” had no meaning for most of the
onlookers.

At that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the Thing had come
from the planet Mars, but I judged it improbable that it contained any
living creature. I thought the unscrewing might be automatic. In spite
of Ogilvy, I still believed that there were men in Mars. My mind ran
fancifully on the possibilities of its containing manuscript, on the
difficulties in translation that might arise, whether we should find
coins and models in it, and so forth. Yet it was a little too large for
assurance on this idea. I felt an impatience to see it opened. About
eleven, as nothing seemed happening, I walked back, full of such
thought, to my home in Maybury. But I found it difficult to get to work
upon my abstract investigations.

In the afternoon the appearance of the common had altered very much.
The early editions of the evening papers had startled London with
enormous headlines:

“A MESSAGE RECEIVED FROM MARS.”


“REMARKABLE STORY FROM WOKING,”


and so forth. In addition, Ogilvy’s wire to the Astronomical Exchange
had roused every observatory in the three kingdoms.

There were half a dozen flys or more from the Woking station standing
in the road by the sand-pits, a basket-chaise from Chobham, and a
rather lordly carriage. Besides that, there was quite a heap of
bicycles. In addition, a large number of people must have walked, in
spite of the heat of the day, from Woking and Chertsey, so that there
was altogether quite a considerable crowd—one or two gaily dressed
ladies among the others.

It was glaringly hot, not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind, and
the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees. The burning
heather had been extinguished, but the level ground towards Ottershaw
was blackened as far as one could see, and still giving off vertical
streamers of smoke. An enterprising sweet-stuff dealer in the Chobham
Road had sent up his son with a barrow-load of green apples and ginger
beer.

Going to the edge of the pit, I found it occupied by a group of about
half a dozen men—Henderson, Ogilvy, and a tall, fair-haired man that I
afterwards learned was Stent, the Astronomer Royal, with several
workmen wielding spades and pickaxes. Stent was giving directions in a
clear, high-pitched voice. He was standing on the cylinder, which was
now evidently much cooler; his face was crimson and streaming with
perspiration, and something seemed to have irritated him.

A large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered, though its lower
end was still embedded. As soon as Ogilvy saw me among the staring
crowd on the edge of the pit he called to me to come down, and asked me
if I would mind going over to see Lord Hilton, the lord of the manor.

The growing crowd, he said, was becoming a serious impediment to their
excavations, especially the boys. They wanted a light railing put up,
and help to keep the people back. He told me that a faint stirring was
occasionally still audible within the case, but that the workmen had
failed to unscrew the top, as it afforded no grip to them. The case
appeared to be enormously thick, and it was possible that the faint
sounds we heard represented a noisy tumult in the interior.

I was very glad to do as he asked, and so become one of the privileged
spectators within the contemplated enclosure. I failed to find Lord
Hilton at his house, but I was told he was expected from London by the
six o’clock train from Waterloo; and as it was then about a quarter
past five, I went home, had some tea, and walked up to the station to
waylay him.




IV.
THE CYLINDER OPENS.


When I returned to the common the sun was setting. Scattered groups
were hurrying from the direction of Woking, and one or two persons were
returning. The crowd about the pit had increased, and stood out black
against the lemon yellow of the sky—a couple of hundred people,
perhaps. There were raised voices, and some sort of struggle appeared
to be going on about the pit. Strange imaginings passed through my
mind. As I drew nearer I heard Stent’s voice:

“Keep back! Keep back!”

A boy came running towards me.

“It’s a-movin’,” he said to me as he passed; “a-screwin’ and a-screwin’
out. I don’t like it. I’m a-goin’ ’ome, I am.”

I went on to the crowd. There were really, I should think, two or three
hundred people elbowing and jostling one another, the one or two ladies
there being by no means the least active.

“He’s fallen in the pit!” cried some one.

“Keep back!” said several.

The crowd swayed a little, and I elbowed my way through. Every one
seemed greatly excited. I heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit.

“I say!” said Ogilvy; “help keep these idiots back. We don’t know
what’s in the confounded thing, you know!”

I saw a young man, a shop assistant in Woking I believe he was,
standing on the cylinder and trying to scramble out of the hole again.
The crowd had pushed him in.

The end of the cylinder was being screwed out from within. Nearly two
feet of shining screw projected. Somebody blundered against me, and I
narrowly missed being pitched onto the top of the screw. I turned, and
as I did so the screw must have come out, for the lid of the cylinder
fell upon the gravel with a ringing concussion. I stuck my elbow into
the person behind me, and turned my head towards the Thing again. For a
moment that circular cavity seemed perfectly black. I had the sunset in
my eyes.

I think everyone expected to see a man emerge—possibly something a
little unlike us terrestrial men, but in all essentials a man. I know I
did. But, looking, I presently saw something stirring within the
shadow: greyish billowy movements, one above another, and then two
luminous disks—like eyes. Then something resembling a little grey
snake, about the thickness of a walking stick, coiled up out of the
writhing middle, and wriggled in the air towards me—and then another.

A sudden chill came over me. There was a loud shriek from a woman
behind. I half turned, keeping my eyes fixed upon the cylinder still,
from which other tentacles were now projecting, and began pushing my
way back from the edge of the pit. I saw astonishment giving place to
horror on the faces of the people about me. I heard inarticulate
exclamations on all sides. There was a general movement backwards. I
saw the shopman struggling still on the edge of the pit. I found myself
alone, and saw the people on the other side of the pit running off,
Stent among them. I looked again at the cylinder, and ungovernable
terror gripped me. I stood petrified and staring.

A big greyish rounded bulk, the size, perhaps, of a bear, was rising
slowly and painfully out of the cylinder. As it bulged up and caught
the light, it glistened like wet leather.

Two large dark-coloured eyes were regarding me steadfastly. The mass
that framed them, the head of the thing, was rounded, and had, one
might say, a face. There was a mouth under the eyes, the lipless brim
of which quivered and panted, and dropped saliva. The whole creature
heaved and pulsated convulsively. A lank tentacular appendage gripped
the edge of the cylinder, another swayed in the air.

Those who have never seen a living Martian can scarcely imagine the
strange horror of its appearance. The peculiar V-shaped mouth with its
pointed upper lip, the absence of brow ridges, the absence of a chin
beneath the wedgelike lower lip, the incessant quivering of this mouth,
the Gorgon groups of tentacles, the tumultuous breathing of the lungs
in a strange atmosphere, the evident heaviness and painfulness of
movement due to the greater gravitational energy of the earth—above
all, the extraordinary intensity of the immense eyes—were at once
vital, intense, inhuman, crippled and monstrous. There was something
fungoid in the oily brown skin, something in the clumsy deliberation of
the tedious movements unspeakably nasty. Even at this first encounter,
this first glimpse, I was overcome with disgust and dread.

Suddenly the monster vanished. It had toppled over the brim of the
cylinder and fallen into the pit, with a thud like the fall of a great
mass of leather. I heard it give a peculiar thick cry, and forthwith
another of these creatures appeared darkly in the deep shadow of the
aperture.

I turned and, running madly, made for the first group of trees, perhaps
a hundred yards away; but I ran slantingly and stumbling, for I could
not avert my face from these things.

There, among some young pine trees and furze bushes, I stopped,
panting, and waited further developments. The common round the
sand-pits was dotted with people, standing like myself in a
half-fascinated terror, staring at these creatures, or rather at the
heaped gravel at the edge of the pit in which they lay. And then, with
a renewed horror, I saw a round, black object bobbing up and down on
the edge of the pit. It was the head of the shopman who had fallen in,
but showing as a little black object against the hot western sun. Now
he got his shoulder and knee up, and again he seemed to slip back until
only his head was visible. Suddenly he vanished, and I could have
fancied a faint shriek had reached me. I had a momentary impulse to go
back and help him that my fears overruled.

Everything was then quite invisible, hidden by the deep pit and the
heap of sand that the fall of the cylinder had made. Anyone coming
along the road from Chobham or Woking would have been amazed at the
sight—a dwindling multitude of perhaps a hundred people or more
standing in a great irregular circle, in ditches, behind bushes, behind
gates and hedges, saying little to one another and that in short,
excited shouts, and staring, staring hard at a few heaps of sand. The
barrow of ginger beer stood, a queer derelict, black against the
burning sky, and in the sand-pits was a row of deserted vehicles with
their horses feeding out of nosebags or pawing the ground.




V.
THE HEAT-RAY.


After the glimpse I had had of the Martians emerging from the cylinder
in which they had come to the earth from their planet, a kind of
fascination paralysed my actions. I remained standing knee-deep in the
heather, staring at the mound that hid them. I was a battleground of
fear and curiosity.

I did not dare to go back towards the pit, but I felt a passionate
longing to peer into it. I began walking, therefore, in a big curve,
seeking some point of vantage and continually looking at the sand-heaps
that hid these new-comers to our earth. Once a leash of thin black
whips, like the arms of an octopus, flashed across the sunset and was
immediately withdrawn, and afterwards a thin rod rose up, joint by
joint, bearing at its apex a circular disk that spun with a wobbling
motion. What could be going on there?

Most of the spectators had gathered in one or two groups—one a little
crowd towards Woking, the other a knot of people in the direction of
Chobham. Evidently they shared my mental conflict. There were few near
me. One man I approached—he was, I perceived, a neighbour of mine,
though I did not know his name—and accosted. But it was scarcely a time
for articulate conversation.

“What ugly _brutes_!” he said. “Good God! What ugly brutes!” He
repeated this over and over again.

“Did you see a man in the pit?” I said; but he made no answer to that.
We became silent, and stood watching for a time side by side, deriving,
I fancy, a certain comfort in one another’s company. Then I shifted my
position to a little knoll that gave me the advantage of a yard or more
of elevation and when I looked for him presently he was walking towards
Woking.

The sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened. The
crowd far away on the left, towards Woking, seemed to grow, and I heard
now a faint murmur from it. The little knot of people towards Chobham
dispersed. There was scarcely an intimation of movement from the pit.

It was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage, and I
suppose the new arrivals from Woking also helped to restore confidence.
At any rate, as the dusk came on a slow, intermittent movement upon the
sand-pits began, a movement that seemed to gather force as the
stillness of the evening about the cylinder remained unbroken. Vertical
black figures in twos and threes would advance, stop, watch, and
advance again, spreading out as they did so in a thin irregular
crescent that promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated horns. I,
too, on my side began to move towards the pit.

Then I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand-pits,
and heard the clatter of hoofs and the gride of wheels. I saw a lad
trundling off the barrow of apples. And then, within thirty yards of
the pit, advancing from the direction of Horsell, I noted a little
black knot of men, the foremost of whom was waving a white flag.

This was the Deputation. There had been a hasty consultation, and since
the Martians were evidently, in spite of their repulsive forms,
intelligent creatures, it had been resolved to show them, by
approaching them with signals, that we too were intelligent.

Flutter, flutter, went the flag, first to the right, then to the left.
It was too far for me to recognise anyone there, but afterwards I
learned that Ogilvy, Stent, and Henderson were with others in this
attempt at communication. This little group had in its advance dragged
inward, so to speak, the circumference of the now almost complete
circle of people, and a number of dim black figures followed it at
discreet distances.

Suddenly there was a flash of light, and a quantity of luminous
greenish smoke came out of the pit in three distinct puffs, which drove
up, one after the other, straight into the still air.

This smoke (or flame, perhaps, would be the better word for it) was so
bright that the deep blue sky overhead and the hazy stretches of brown
common towards Chertsey, set with black pine trees, seemed to darken
abruptly as these puffs arose, and to remain the darker after their
dispersal. At the same time a faint hissing sound became audible.

Beyond the pit stood the little wedge of people with the white flag at
its apex, arrested by these phenomena, a little knot of small vertical
black shapes upon the black ground. As the green smoke arose, their
faces flashed out pallid green, and faded again as it vanished. Then
slowly the hissing passed into a humming, into a long, loud, droning
noise. Slowly a humped shape rose out of the pit, and the ghost of a
beam of light seemed to flicker out from it.

Forthwith flashes of actual flame, a bright glare leaping from one to
another, sprang from the scattered group of men. It was as if some
invisible jet impinged upon them and flashed into white flame. It was
as if each man were suddenly and momentarily turned to fire.

Then, by the light of their own destruction, I saw them staggering and
falling, and their supporters turning to run.

I stood staring, not as yet realising that this was death leaping from
man to man in that little distant crowd. All I felt was that it was
something very strange. An almost noiseless and blinding flash of
light, and a man fell headlong and lay still; and as the unseen shaft
of heat passed over them, pine trees burst into fire, and every dry
furze bush became with one dull thud a mass of flames. And far away
towards Knaphill I saw the flashes of trees and hedges and wooden
buildings suddenly set alight.

It was sweeping round swiftly and steadily, this flaming death, this
invisible, inevitable sword of heat. I perceived it coming towards me
by the flashing bushes it touched, and was too astounded and stupefied
to stir. I heard the crackle of fire in the sand-pits and the sudden
squeal of a horse that was as suddenly stilled. Then it was as if an
invisible yet intensely heated finger were drawn through the heather
between me and the Martians, and all along a curving line beyond the
sand-pits the dark ground smoked and crackled. Something fell with a
crash far away to the left where the road from Woking station opens out
on the common. Forth-with the hissing and humming ceased, and the
black, dome-like object sank slowly out of sight into the pit.

All this had happened with such swiftness that I had stood motionless,
dumbfounded and dazzled by the flashes of light. Had that death swept
through a full circle, it must inevitably have slain me in my surprise.
But it passed and spared me, and left the night about me suddenly dark
and unfamiliar.

The undulating common seemed now dark almost to blackness, except where
its roadways lay grey and pale under the deep blue sky of the early
night. It was dark, and suddenly void of men. Overhead the stars were
mustering, and in the west the sky was still a pale, bright, almost
greenish blue. The tops of the pine trees and the roofs of Horsell came
out sharp and black against the western afterglow. The Martians and
their appliances were altogether invisible, save for that thin mast
upon which their restless mirror wobbled. Patches of bush and isolated
trees here and there smoked and glowed still, and the houses towards
Woking station were sending up spires of flame into the stillness of
the evening air.

Nothing was changed save for that and a terrible astonishment. The
little group of black specks with the flag of white had been swept out
of existence, and the stillness of the evening, so it seemed to me, had
scarcely been broken.

It came to me that I was upon this dark common, helpless, unprotected,
and alone. Suddenly, like a thing falling upon me from without,
came—fear.

With an effort I turned and began a stumbling run through the heather.

The fear I felt was no rational fear, but a panic terror not only of
the Martians, but of the dusk and stillness all about me. Such an
extraordinary effect in unmanning me it had that I ran weeping silently
as a child might do. Once I had turned, I did not dare to look back.

I remember I felt an extraordinary persuasion that I was being played
with, that presently, when I was upon the very verge of safety, this
mysterious death—as swift as the passage of light—would leap after me
from the pit about the cylinder, and strike me down.




VI.
THE HEAT-RAY IN THE CHOBHAM ROAD.


It is still a matter of wonder how the Martians are able to slay men so
swiftly and so silently. Many think that in some way they are able to
generate an intense heat in a chamber of practically absolute
non-conductivity. This intense heat they project in a parallel beam
against any object they choose, by means of a polished parabolic mirror
of unknown composition, much as the parabolic mirror of a lighthouse
projects a beam of light. But no one has absolutely proved these
details. However it is done, it is certain that a beam of heat is the
essence of the matter. Heat, and invisible, instead of visible, light.
Whatever is combustible flashes into flame at its touch, lead runs like
water, it softens iron, cracks and melts glass, and when it falls upon
water, incontinently that explodes into steam.

That night nearly forty people lay under the starlight about the pit,
charred and distorted beyond recognition, and all night long the common
from Horsell to Maybury was deserted and brightly ablaze.

The news of the massacre probably reached Chobham, Woking, and
Ottershaw about the same time. In Woking the shops had closed when the
tragedy happened, and a number of people, shop people and so forth,
attracted by the stories they had heard, were walking over the Horsell
Bridge and along the road between the hedges that runs out at last upon
the common. You may imagine the young people brushed up after the
labours of the day, and making this novelty, as they would make any
novelty, the excuse for walking together and enjoying a trivial
flirtation. You may figure to yourself the hum of voices along the road
in the gloaming. . . .

As yet, of course, few people in Woking even knew that the cylinder had
opened, though poor Henderson had sent a messenger on a bicycle to the
post office with a special wire to an evening paper.

As these folks came out by twos and threes upon the open, they found
little knots of people talking excitedly and peering at the spinning
mirror over the sand-pits, and the newcomers were, no doubt, soon
infected by the excitement of the occasion.

By half past eight, when the Deputation was destroyed, there may have
been a crowd of three hundred people or more at this place, besides
those who had left the road to approach the Martians nearer. There were
three policemen too, one of whom was mounted, doing their best, under
instructions from Stent, to keep the people back and deter them from
approaching the cylinder. There was some booing from those more
thoughtless and excitable souls to whom a crowd is always an occasion
for noise and horse-play.

Stent and Ogilvy, anticipating some possibilities of a collision, had
telegraphed from Horsell to the barracks as soon as the Martians
emerged, for the help of a company of soldiers to protect these strange
creatures from violence. After that they returned to lead that
ill-fated advance. The description of their death, as it was seen by
the crowd, tallies very closely with my own impressions: the three
puffs of green smoke, the deep humming note, and the flashes of flame.

But that crowd of people had a far narrower escape than mine. Only the
fact that a hummock of heathery sand intercepted the lower part of the
Heat-Ray saved them. Had the elevation of the parabolic mirror been a
few yards higher, none could have lived to tell the tale. They saw the
flashes and the men falling and an invisible hand, as it were, lit the
bushes as it hurried towards them through the twilight. Then, with a
whistling note that rose above the droning of the pit, the beam swung
close over their heads, lighting the tops of the beech trees that line
the road, and splitting the bricks, smashing the windows, firing the
window frames, and bringing down in crumbling ruin a portion of the
gable of the house nearest the corner.

In the sudden thud, hiss, and glare of the igniting trees, the
panic-stricken crowd seems to have swayed hesitatingly for some
moments. Sparks and burning twigs began to fall into the road, and
single leaves like puffs of flame. Hats and dresses caught fire. Then
came a crying from the common. There were shrieks and shouts, and
suddenly a mounted policeman came galloping through the confusion with
his hands clasped over his head, screaming.

“They’re coming!” a woman shrieked, and incontinently everyone was
turning and pushing at those behind, in order to clear their way to
Woking again. They must have bolted as blindly as a flock of sheep.
Where the road grows narrow and black between the high banks the crowd
jammed, and a desperate struggle occurred. All that crowd did not
escape; three persons at least, two women and a little boy, were
crushed and trampled there, and left to die amid the terror and the
darkness.




VII.
HOW I REACHED HOME.


For my own part, I remember nothing of my flight except the stress of
blundering against trees and stumbling through the heather. All about
me gathered the invisible terrors of the Martians; that pitiless sword
of heat seemed whirling to and fro, flourishing overhead before it
descended and smote me out of life. I came into the road between the
crossroads and Horsell, and ran along this to the crossroads.

At last I could go no further; I was exhausted with the violence of my
emotion and of my flight, and I staggered and fell by the wayside. That
was near the bridge that crosses the canal by the gasworks. I fell and
lay still.

I must have remained there some time.

I sat up, strangely perplexed. For a moment, perhaps, I could not
clearly understand how I came there. My terror had fallen from me like
a garment. My hat had gone, and my collar had burst away from its
fastener. A few minutes before, there had only been three real things
before me—the immensity of the night and space and nature, my own
feebleness and anguish, and the near approach of death. Now it was as
if something turned over, and the point of view altered abruptly. There
was no sensible transition from one state of mind to the other. I was
immediately the self of every day again—a decent, ordinary citizen. The
silent common, the impulse of my flight, the starting flames, were as
if they had been in a dream. I asked myself had these latter things
indeed happened? I could not credit it.

I rose and walked unsteadily up the steep incline of the bridge. My
mind was blank wonder. My muscles and nerves seemed drained of their
strength. I dare say I staggered drunkenly. A head rose over the arch,
and the figure of a workman carrying a basket appeared. Beside him ran
a little boy. He passed me, wishing me good night. I was minded to
speak to him, but did not. I answered his greeting with a meaningless
mumble and went on over the bridge.

Over the Maybury arch a train, a billowing tumult of white, firelit
smoke, and a long caterpillar of lighted windows, went flying
south—clatter, clatter, clap, rap, and it had gone. A dim group of
people talked in the gate of one of the houses in the pretty little row
of gables that was called Oriental Terrace. It was all so real and so
familiar. And that behind me! It was frantic, fantastic! Such things, I
told myself, could not be.

Perhaps I am a man of exceptional moods. I do not know how far my
experience is common. At times I suffer from the strangest sense of
detachment from myself and the world about me; I seem to watch it all
from the outside, from somewhere inconceivably remote, out of time, out
of space, out of the stress and tragedy of it all. This feeling was
very strong upon me that night. Here was another side to my dream.

But the trouble was the blank incongruity of this serenity and the
swift death flying yonder, not two miles away. There was a noise of
business from the gasworks, and the electric lamps were all alight. I
stopped at the group of people.

“What news from the common?” said I.

There were two men and a woman at the gate.

“Eh?” said one of the men, turning.

“What news from the common?” I said.

“Ain’t yer just _been_ there?” asked the men.

“People seem fair silly about the common,” said the woman over the
gate. “What’s it all abart?”

“Haven’t you heard of the men from Mars?” said I; “the creatures from
Mars?”

“Quite enough,” said the woman over the gate. “Thenks”; and all three
of them laughed.

I felt foolish and angry. I tried and found I could not tell them what
I had seen. They laughed again at my broken sentences.

“You’ll hear more yet,” I said, and went on to my home.

I startled my wife at the doorway, so haggard was I. I went into the
dining room, sat down, drank some wine, and so soon as I could collect
myself sufficiently I told her the things I had seen. The dinner, which
was a cold one, had already been served, and remained neglected on the
table while I told my story.

“There is one thing,” I said, to allay the fears I had aroused; “they
are the most sluggish things I ever saw crawl. They may keep the pit
and kill people who come near them, but they cannot get out of it. . .
. But the horror of them!”

“Don’t, dear!” said my wife, knitting her brows and putting her hand on
mine.

“Poor Ogilvy!” I said. “To think he may be lying dead there!”

My wife at least did not find my experience incredible. When I saw how
deadly white her face was, I ceased abruptly.

“They may come here,” she said again and again.

I pressed her to take wine, and tried to reassure her.

“They can scarcely move,” I said.

I began to comfort her and myself by repeating all that Ogilvy had told
me of the impossibility of the Martians establishing themselves on the
earth. In particular I laid stress on the gravitational difficulty. On
the surface of the earth the force of gravity is three times what it is
on the surface of Mars. A Martian, therefore, would weigh three times
more than on Mars, albeit his muscular strength would be the same. His
own body would be a cope of lead to him, therefore. That, indeed, was
the general opinion. Both _The Times_ and the _Daily Telegraph_, for
instance, insisted on it the next morning, and both overlooked, just as
I did, two obvious modifying influences.

The atmosphere of the earth, we now know, contains far more oxygen or
far less argon (whichever way one likes to put it) than does Mars’. The
invigorating influences of this excess of oxygen upon the Martians
indisputably did much to counterbalance the increased weight of their
bodies. And, in the second place, we all overlooked the fact that such
mechanical intelligence as the Martian possessed was quite able to
dispense with muscular exertion at a pinch.

But I did not consider these points at the time, and so my reasoning
was dead against the chances of the invaders. With wine and food, the
confidence of my own table, and the necessity of reassuring my wife, I
grew by insensible degrees courageous and secure.

“They have done a foolish thing,” said I, fingering my wineglass. “They
are dangerous because, no doubt, they are mad with terror. Perhaps they
expected to find no living things—certainly no intelligent living
things.”

“A shell in the pit,” said I, “if the worst comes to the worst, will
kill them all.”

The intense excitement of the events had no doubt left my perceptive
powers in a state of erethism. I remember that dinner table with
extraordinary vividness even now. My dear wife’s sweet anxious face
peering at me from under the pink lamp shade, the white cloth with its
silver and glass table furniture—for in those days even philosophical
writers had many little luxuries—the crimson-purple wine in my glass,
are photographically distinct. At the end of it I sat, tempering nuts
with a cigarette, regretting Ogilvy’s rashness, and denouncing the
short-sighted timidity of the Martians.

So some respectable dodo in the Mauritius might have lorded it in his
nest, and discussed the arrival of that shipful of pitiless sailors in
want of animal food. “We will peck them to death tomorrow, my dear.”

I did not know it, but that was the last civilised dinner I was to eat
for very many strange and terrible days.




VIII.
FRIDAY NIGHT.


The most extraordinary thing to my mind, of all the strange and
wonderful things that happened upon that Friday, was the dovetailing of
the commonplace habits of our social order with the first beginnings of
the series of events that was to topple that social order headlong. If
on Friday night you had taken a pair of compasses and drawn a circle
with a radius of five miles round the Woking sand-pits, I doubt if you
would have had one human being outside it, unless it were some relation
of Stent or of the three or four cyclists or London people lying dead
on the common, whose emotions or habits were at all affected by the
new-comers. Many people had heard of the cylinder, of course, and
talked about it in their leisure, but it certainly did not make the
sensation that an ultimatum to Germany would have done.

In London that night poor Henderson’s telegram describing the gradual
unscrewing of the shot was judged to be a canard, and his evening
paper, after wiring for authentication from him and receiving no
reply—the man was killed—decided not to print a special edition.

Even within the five-mile circle the great majority of people were
inert. I have already described the behaviour of the men and women to
whom I spoke. All over the district people were dining and supping;
working men were gardening after the labours of the day, children were
being put to bed, young people were wandering through the lanes
love-making, students sat over their books.

Maybe there was a murmur in the village streets, a novel and dominant
topic in the public-houses, and here and there a messenger, or even an
eye-witness of the later occurrences, caused a whirl of excitement, a
shouting, and a running to and fro; but for the most part the daily
routine of working, eating, drinking, sleeping, went on as it had done
for countless years—as though no planet Mars existed in the sky. Even
at Woking station and Horsell and Chobham that was the case.

In Woking junction, until a late hour, trains were stopping and going
on, others were shunting on the sidings, passengers were alighting and
waiting, and everything was proceeding in the most ordinary way. A boy
from the town, trenching on Smith’s monopoly, was selling papers with
the afternoon’s news. The ringing impact of trucks, the sharp whistle
of the engines from the junction, mingled with their shouts of “Men
from Mars!” Excited men came into the station about nine o’clock with
incredible tidings, and caused no more disturbance than drunkards might
have done. People rattling Londonwards peered into the darkness outside
the carriage windows, and saw only a rare, flickering, vanishing spark
dance up from the direction of Horsell, a red glow and a thin veil of
smoke driving across the stars, and thought that nothing more serious
than a heath fire was happening. It was only round the edge of the
common that any disturbance was perceptible. There were half a dozen
villas burning on the Woking border. There were lights in all the
houses on the common side of the three villages, and the people there
kept awake till dawn.

A curious crowd lingered restlessly, people coming and going but the
crowd remaining, both on the Chobham and Horsell bridges. One or two
adventurous souls, it was afterwards found, went into the darkness and
crawled quite near the Martians; but they never returned, for now and
again a light-ray, like the beam of a warship’s searchlight swept the
common, and the Heat-Ray was ready to follow. Save for such, that big
area of common was silent and desolate, and the charred bodies lay
about on it all night under the stars, and all the next day. A noise of
hammering from the pit was heard by many people.

So you have the state of things on Friday night. In the centre,
sticking into the skin of our old planet Earth like a poisoned dart,
was this cylinder. But the poison was scarcely working yet. Around it
was a patch of silent common, smouldering in places, and with a few
dark, dimly seen objects lying in contorted attitudes here and there.
Here and there was a burning bush or tree. Beyond was a fringe of
excitement, and farther than that fringe the inflammation had not crept
as yet. In the rest of the world the stream of life still flowed as it
had flowed for immemorial years. The fever of war that would presently
clog vein and artery, deaden nerve and destroy brain, had still to
develop.

All night long the Martians were hammering and stirring, sleepless,
indefatigable, at work upon the machines they were making ready, and
ever and again a puff of greenish-white smoke whirled up to the starlit
sky.

About eleven a company of soldiers came through Horsell, and deployed
along the edge of the common to form a cordon. Later a second company
marched through Chobham to deploy on the north side of the common.
Several officers from the Inkerman barracks had been on the common
earlier in the day, and one, Major Eden, was reported to be missing.
The colonel of the regiment came to the Chobham bridge and was busy
questioning the crowd at midnight. The military authorities were
certainly alive to the seriousness of the business. About eleven, the
next morning’s papers were able to say, a squadron of hussars, two
Maxims, and about four hundred men of the Cardigan regiment started
from Aldershot.

A few seconds after midnight the crowd in the Chertsey road, Woking,
saw a star fall from heaven into the pine woods to the northwest. It
had a greenish colour, and caused a silent brightness like summer
lightning. This was the second cylinder.




IX.
THE FIGHTING BEGINS.


Saturday lives in my memory as a day of suspense. It was a day of
lassitude too, hot and close, with, I am told, a rapidly fluctuating
barometer. I had slept but little, though my wife had succeeded in
sleeping, and I rose early. I went into my garden before breakfast and
stood listening, but towards the common there was nothing stirring but
a lark.

The milkman came as usual. I heard the rattle of his chariot and I went
round to the side gate to ask the latest news. He told me that during
the night the Martians had been surrounded by troops, and that guns
were expected. Then—a familiar, reassuring note—I heard a train running
towards Woking.

“They aren’t to be killed,” said the milkman, “if that can possibly be
avoided.”

I saw my neighbour gardening, chatted with him for a time, and then
strolled in to breakfast. It was a most unexceptional morning. My
neighbour was of opinion that the troops would be able to capture or to
destroy the Martians during the day.

“It’s a pity they make themselves so unapproachable,” he said. “It
would be curious to know how they live on another planet; we might
learn a thing or two.”

He came up to the fence and extended a handful of strawberries, for his
gardening was as generous as it was enthusiastic. At the same time he
told me of the burning of the pine woods about the Byfleet Golf Links.

“They say,” said he, “that there’s another of those blessed things
fallen there—number two. But one’s enough, surely. This lot’ll cost the
insurance people a pretty penny before everything’s settled.” He
laughed with an air of the greatest good humour as he said this. The
woods, he said, were still burning, and pointed out a haze of smoke to
me. “They will be hot under foot for days, on account of the thick soil
of pine needles and turf,” he said, and then grew serious over “poor
Ogilvy.”

After breakfast, instead of working, I decided to walk down towards the
common. Under the railway bridge I found a group of soldiers—sappers, I
think, men in small round caps, dirty red jackets unbuttoned, and
showing their blue shirts, dark trousers, and boots coming to the calf.
They told me no one was allowed over the canal, and, looking along the
road towards the bridge, I saw one of the Cardigan men standing
sentinel there. I talked with these soldiers for a time; I told them of
my sight of the Martians on the previous evening. None of them had seen
the Martians, and they had but the vaguest ideas of them, so that they
plied me with questions. They said that they did not know who had
authorised the movements of the troops; their idea was that a dispute
had arisen at the Horse Guards. The ordinary sapper is a great deal
better educated than the common soldier, and they discussed the
peculiar conditions of the possible fight with some acuteness. I
described the Heat-Ray to them, and they began to argue among
themselves.

“Crawl up under cover and rush ’em, say I,” said one.

“Get aht!” said another. “What’s cover against this ’ere ’eat? Sticks
to cook yer! What we got to do is to go as near as the ground’ll let
us, and then drive a trench.”

“Blow yer trenches! You always want trenches; you ought to ha’ been
born a rabbit Snippy.”

“Ain’t they got any necks, then?” said a third, abruptly—a little,
contemplative, dark man, smoking a pipe.

I repeated my description.

“Octopuses,” said he, “that’s what I calls ’em. Talk about fishers of
men—fighters of fish it is this time!”

“It ain’t no murder killing beasts like that,” said the first speaker.

“Why not shell the darned things strite off and finish ’em?” said the
little dark man. “You carn tell what they might do.”

“Where’s your shells?” said the first speaker. “There ain’t no time. Do
it in a rush, that’s my tip, and do it at once.”

So they discussed it. After a while I left them, and went on to the
railway station to get as many morning papers as I could.

But I will not weary the reader with a description of that long morning
and of the longer afternoon. I did not succeed in getting a glimpse of
the common, for even Horsell and Chobham church towers were in the
hands of the military authorities. The soldiers I addressed didn’t know
anything; the officers were mysterious as well as busy. I found people
in the town quite secure again in the presence of the military, and I
heard for the first time from Marshall, the tobacconist, that his son
was among the dead on the common. The soldiers had made the people on
the outskirts of Horsell lock up and leave their houses.

I got back to lunch about two, very tired for, as I have said, the day
was extremely hot and dull; and in order to refresh myself I took a
cold bath in the afternoon. About half past four I went up to the
railway station to get an evening paper, for the morning papers had
contained only a very inaccurate description of the killing of Stent,
Henderson, Ogilvy, and the others. But there was little I didn’t know.
The Martians did not show an inch of themselves. They seemed busy in
their pit, and there was a sound of hammering and an almost continuous
streamer of smoke. Apparently they were busy getting ready for a
struggle. “Fresh attempts have been made to signal, but without
success,” was the stereotyped formula of the papers. A sapper told me
it was done by a man in a ditch with a flag on a long pole. The
Martians took as much notice of such advances as we should of the
lowing of a cow.

I must confess the sight of all this armament, all this preparation,
greatly excited me. My imagination became belligerent, and defeated the
invaders in a dozen striking ways; something of my schoolboy dreams of
battle and heroism came back. It hardly seemed a fair fight to me at
that time. They seemed very helpless in that pit of theirs.

About three o’clock there began the thud of a gun at measured intervals
from Chertsey or Addlestone. I learned that the smouldering pine wood
into which the second cylinder had fallen was being shelled, in the
hope of destroying that object before it opened. It was only about
five, however, that a field gun reached Chobham for use against the
first body of Martians.

About six in the evening, as I sat at tea with my wife in the
summerhouse talking vigorously about the battle that was lowering upon
us, I heard a muffled detonation from the common, and immediately after
a gust of firing. Close on the heels of that came a violent rattling
crash, quite close to us, that shook the ground; and, starting out upon
the lawn, I saw the tops of the trees about the Oriental College burst
into smoky red flame, and the tower of the little church beside it
slide down into ruin. The pinnacle of the mosque had vanished, and the
roof line of the college itself looked as if a hundred-ton gun had been
at work upon it. One of our chimneys cracked as if a shot had hit it,
flew, and a piece of it came clattering down the tiles and made a heap
of broken red fragments upon the flower bed by my study window.

I and my wife stood amazed. Then I realised that the crest of Maybury
Hill must be within range of the Martians’ Heat-Ray now that the
college was cleared out of the way.

At that I gripped my wife’s arm, and without ceremony ran her out into
the road. Then I fetched out the servant, telling her I would go
upstairs myself for the box she was clamouring for.

“We can’t possibly stay here,” I said; and as I spoke the firing
reopened for a moment upon the common.

“But where are we to go?” said my wife in terror.

I thought perplexed. Then I remembered her cousins at Leatherhead.

“Leatherhead!” I shouted above the sudden noise.

She looked away from me downhill. The people were coming out of their
houses, astonished.

“How are we to get to Leatherhead?” she said.

Down the hill I saw a bevy of hussars ride under the railway bridge;
three galloped through the open gates of the Oriental College; two
others dismounted, and began running from house to house. The sun,
shining through the smoke that drove up from the tops of the trees,
seemed blood red, and threw an unfamiliar lurid light upon everything.

“Stop here,” said I; “you are safe here”; and I started off at once for
the Spotted Dog, for I knew the landlord had a horse and dog cart. I
ran, for I perceived that in a moment everyone upon this side of the
hill would be moving. I found him in his bar, quite unaware of what was
going on behind his house. A man stood with his back to me, talking to
him.

“I must have a pound,” said the landlord, “and I’ve no one to drive
it.”

“I’ll give you two,” said I, over the stranger’s shoulder.

“What for?”

“And I’ll bring it back by midnight,” I said.

“Lord!” said the landlord; “what’s the hurry? I’m selling my bit of a
pig. Two pounds, and you bring it back? What’s going on now?”

I explained hastily that I had to leave my home, and so secured the dog
cart. At the time it did not seem to me nearly so urgent that the
landlord should leave his. I took care to have the cart there and then,
drove it off down the road, and, leaving it in charge of my wife and
servant, rushed into my house and packed a few valuables, such plate as
we had, and so forth. The beech trees below the house were burning
while I did this, and the palings up the road glowed red. While I was
occupied in this way, one of the dismounted hussars came running up. He
was going from house to house, warning people to leave. He was going on
as I came out of my front door, lugging my treasures, done up in a
tablecloth. I shouted after him:

“What news?”

He turned, stared, bawled something about “crawling out in a thing like
a dish cover,” and ran on to the gate of the house at the crest. A
sudden whirl of black smoke driving across the road hid him for a
moment. I ran to my neighbour’s door and rapped to satisfy myself of
what I already knew, that his wife had gone to London with him and had
locked up their house. I went in again, according to my promise, to get
my servant’s box, lugged it out, clapped it beside her on the tail of
the dog cart, and then caught the reins and jumped up into the driver’s
seat beside my wife. In another moment we were clear of the smoke and
noise, and spanking down the opposite slope of Maybury Hill towards Old
Woking.

In front was a quiet sunny landscape, a wheat field ahead on either
side of the road, and the Maybury Inn with its swinging sign. I saw the
doctor’s cart ahead of me. At the bottom of the hill I turned my head
to look at the hillside I was leaving. Thick streamers of black smoke
shot with threads of red fire were driving up into the still air, and
throwing dark shadows upon the green treetops eastward. The smoke
already extended far away to the east and west—to the Byfleet pine
woods eastward, and to Woking on the west. The road was dotted with
people running towards us. And very faint now, but very distinct
through the hot, quiet air, one heard the whirr of a machine-gun that
was presently stilled, and an intermittent cracking of rifles.
Apparently the Martians were setting fire to everything within range of
their Heat-Ray.

I am not an expert driver, and I had immediately to turn my attention
to the horse. When I looked back again the second hill had hidden the
black smoke. I slashed the horse with the whip, and gave him a loose
rein until Woking and Send lay between us and that quivering tumult. I
overtook and passed the doctor between Woking and Send.




X.
IN THE STORM.


Leatherhead is about twelve miles from Maybury Hill. The scent of hay
was in the air through the lush meadows beyond Pyrford, and the hedges
on either side were sweet and gay with multitudes of dog-roses. The
heavy firing that had broken out while we were driving down Maybury
Hill ceased as abruptly as it began, leaving the evening very peaceful
and still. We got to Leatherhead without misadventure about nine
o’clock, and the horse had an hour’s rest while I took supper with my
cousins and commended my wife to their care.

My wife was curiously silent throughout the drive, and seemed oppressed
with forebodings of evil. I talked to her reassuringly, pointing out
that the Martians were tied to the pit by sheer heaviness, and at the
utmost could but crawl a little out of it; but she answered only in
monosyllables. Had it not been for my promise to the innkeeper, she
would, I think, have urged me to stay in Leatherhead that night. Would
that I had! Her face, I remember, was very white as we parted.

For my own part, I had been feverishly excited all day. Something very
like the war fever that occasionally runs through a civilised community
had got into my blood, and in my heart I was not so very sorry that I
had to return to Maybury that night. I was even afraid that that last
fusillade I had heard might mean the extermination of our invaders from
Mars. I can best express my state of mind by saying that I wanted to be
in at the death.

It was nearly eleven when I started to return. The night was
unexpectedly dark; to me, walking out of the lighted passage of my
cousins’ house, it seemed indeed black, and it was as hot and close as
the day. Overhead the clouds were driving fast, albeit not a breath
stirred the shrubs about us. My cousins’ man lit both lamps. Happily, I
knew the road intimately. My wife stood in the light of the doorway,
and watched me until I jumped up into the dog cart. Then abruptly she
turned and went in, leaving my cousins side by side wishing me good
hap.

I was a little depressed at first with the contagion of my wife’s
fears, but very soon my thoughts reverted to the Martians. At that time
I was absolutely in the dark as to the course of the evening’s
fighting. I did not know even the circumstances that had precipitated
the conflict. As I came through Ockham (for that was the way I
returned, and not through Send and Old Woking) I saw along the western
horizon a blood-red glow, which as I drew nearer, crept slowly up the
sky. The driving clouds of the gathering thunderstorm mingled there
with masses of black and red smoke.

Ripley Street was deserted, and except for a lighted window or so the
village showed not a sign of life; but I narrowly escaped an accident
at the corner of the road to Pyrford, where a knot of people stood with
their backs to me. They said nothing to me as I passed. I do not know
what they knew of the things happening beyond the hill, nor do I know
if the silent houses I passed on my way were sleeping securely, or
deserted and empty, or harassed and watching against the terror of the
night.

From Ripley until I came through Pyrford I was in the valley of the
Wey, and the red glare was hidden from me. As I ascended the little
hill beyond Pyrford Church the glare came into view again, and the
trees about me shivered with the first intimation of the storm that was
upon me. Then I heard midnight pealing out from Pyrford Church behind
me, and then came the silhouette of Maybury Hill, with its tree-tops
and roofs black and sharp against the red.

Even as I beheld this a lurid green glare lit the road about me and
showed the distant woods towards Addlestone. I felt a tug at the reins.
I saw that the driving clouds had been pierced as it were by a thread
of green fire, suddenly lighting their confusion and falling into the
field to my left. It was the third falling star!

Close on its apparition, and blindingly violet by contrast, danced out
the first lightning of the gathering storm, and the thunder burst like
a rocket overhead. The horse took the bit between his teeth and bolted.

A moderate incline runs towards the foot of Maybury Hill, and down this
we clattered. Once the lightning had begun, it went on in as rapid a
succession of flashes as I have ever seen. The thunderclaps, treading
one on the heels of another and with a strange crackling accompaniment,
sounded more like the working of a gigantic electric machine than the
usual detonating reverberations. The flickering light was blinding and
confusing, and a thin hail smote gustily at my face as I drove down the
slope.

At first I regarded little but the road before me, and then abruptly my
attention was arrested by something that was moving rapidly down the
opposite slope of Maybury Hill. At first I took it for the wet roof of
a house, but one flash following another showed it to be in swift
rolling movement. It was an elusive vision—a moment of bewildering
darkness, and then, in a flash like daylight, the red masses of the
Orphanage near the crest of the hill, the green tops of the pine trees,
and this problematical object came out clear and sharp and bright.

And this Thing I saw! How can I describe it? A monstrous tripod, higher
than many houses, striding over the young pine trees, and smashing them
aside in its career; a walking engine of glittering metal, striding now
across the heather; articulate ropes of steel dangling from it, and the
clattering tumult of its passage mingling with the riot of the thunder.
A flash, and it came out vividly, heeling over one way with two feet in
the air, to vanish and reappear almost instantly as it seemed, with the
next flash, a hundred yards nearer. Can you imagine a milking stool
tilted and bowled violently along the ground? That was the impression
those instant flashes gave. But instead of a milking stool imagine it a
great body of machinery on a tripod stand.

Then suddenly the trees in the pine wood ahead of me were parted, as
brittle reeds are parted by a man thrusting through them; they were
snapped off and driven headlong, and a second huge tripod appeared,
rushing, as it seemed, headlong towards me. And I was galloping hard to
meet it! At the sight of the second monster my nerve went altogether.
Not stopping to look again, I wrenched the horse’s head hard round to
the right and in another moment the dog cart had heeled over upon the
horse; the shafts smashed noisily, and I was flung sideways and fell
heavily into a shallow pool of water.

I crawled out almost immediately, and crouched, my feet still in the
water, under a clump of furze. The horse lay motionless (his neck was
broken, poor brute!) and by the lightning flashes I saw the black bulk
of the overturned dog cart and the silhouette of the wheel still
spinning slowly. In another moment the colossal mechanism went striding
by me, and passed uphill towards Pyrford.

Seen nearer, the Thing was incredibly strange, for it was no mere
insensate machine driving on its way. Machine it was, with a ringing
metallic pace, and long, flexible, glittering tentacles (one of which
gripped a young pine tree) swinging and rattling about its strange
body. It picked its road as it went striding along, and the brazen hood
that surmounted it moved to and fro with the inevitable suggestion of a
head looking about. Behind the main body was a huge mass of white metal
like a gigantic fisherman’s basket, and puffs of green smoke squirted
out from the joints of the limbs as the monster swept by me. And in an
instant it was gone.

So much I saw then, all vaguely for the flickering of the lightning, in
blinding highlights and dense black shadows.

As it passed it set up an exultant deafening howl that drowned the
thunder—“Aloo! Aloo!”—and in another minute it was with its companion,
half a mile away, stooping over something in the field. I have no doubt
this Thing in the field was the third of the ten cylinders they had
fired at us from Mars.

For some minutes I lay there in the rain and darkness watching, by the
intermittent light, these monstrous beings of metal moving about in the
distance over the hedge tops. A thin hail was now beginning, and as it
came and went their figures grew misty and then flashed into clearness
again. Now and then came a gap in the lightning, and the night
swallowed them up.

I was soaked with hail above and puddle water below. It was some time
before my blank astonishment would let me struggle up the bank to a
drier position, or think at all of my imminent peril.

Not far from me was a little one-roomed squatter’s hut of wood,
surrounded by a patch of potato garden. I struggled to my feet at last,
and, crouching and making use of every chance of cover, I made a run
for this. I hammered at the door, but I could not make the people hear
(if there were any people inside), and after a time I desisted, and,
availing myself of a ditch for the greater part of the way, succeeded
in crawling, unobserved by these monstrous machines, into the pine
woods towards Maybury.

Under cover of this I pushed on, wet and shivering now, towards my own
house. I walked among the trees trying to find the footpath. It was
very dark indeed in the wood, for the lightning was now becoming
infrequent, and the hail, which was pouring down in a torrent, fell in
columns through the gaps in the heavy foliage.

If I had fully realised the meaning of all the things I had seen I
should have immediately worked my way round through Byfleet to Street
Cobham, and so gone back to rejoin my wife at Leatherhead. But that
night the strangeness of things about me, and my physical wretchedness,
prevented me, for I was bruised, weary, wet to the skin, deafened and
blinded by the storm.

I had a vague idea of going on to my own house, and that was as much
motive as I had. I staggered through the trees, fell into a ditch and
bruised my knees against a plank, and finally splashed out into the
lane that ran down from the College Arms. I say splashed, for the storm
water was sweeping the sand down the hill in a muddy torrent. There in
the darkness a man blundered into me and sent me reeling back.

He gave a cry of terror, sprang sideways, and rushed on before I could
gather my wits sufficiently to speak to him. So heavy was the stress of
the storm just at this place that I had the hardest task to win my way
up the hill. I went close up to the fence on the left and worked my way
along its palings.

Near the top I stumbled upon something soft, and, by a flash of
lightning, saw between my feet a heap of black broadcloth and a pair of
boots. Before I could distinguish clearly how the man lay, the flicker
of light had passed. I stood over him waiting for the next flash. When
it came, I saw that he was a sturdy man, cheaply but not shabbily
dressed; his head was bent under his body, and he lay crumpled up close
to the fence, as though he had been flung violently against it.

Overcoming the repugnance natural to one who had never before touched a
dead body, I stooped and turned him over to feel for his heart. He was
quite dead. Apparently his neck had been broken. The lightning flashed
for a third time, and his face leaped upon me. I sprang to my feet. It
was the landlord of the Spotted Dog, whose conveyance I had taken.

I stepped over him gingerly and pushed on up the hill. I made my way by
the police station and the College Arms towards my own house. Nothing
was burning on the hillside, though from the common there still came a
red glare and a rolling tumult of ruddy smoke beating up against the
drenching hail. So far as I could see by the flashes, the houses about
me were mostly uninjured. By the College Arms a dark heap lay in the
road.

Down the road towards Maybury Bridge there were voices and the sound of
feet, but I had not the courage to shout or to go to them. I let myself
in with my latchkey, closed, locked and bolted the door, staggered to
the foot of the staircase, and sat down. My imagination was full of
those striding metallic monsters, and of the dead body smashed against
the fence.

I crouched at the foot of the staircase with my back to the wall,
shivering violently.




XI.
AT THE WINDOW.


I have already said that my storms of emotion have a trick of
exhausting themselves. After a time I discovered that I was cold and
wet, and with little pools of water about me on the stair carpet. I got
up almost mechanically, went into the dining room and drank some
whisky, and then I was moved to change my clothes.

After I had done that I went upstairs to my study, but why I did so I
do not know. The window of my study looks over the trees and the
railway towards Horsell Common. In the hurry of our departure this
window had been left open. The passage was dark, and, by contrast with
the picture the window frame enclosed, the side of the room seemed
impenetrably dark. I stopped short in the doorway.

The thunderstorm had passed. The towers of the Oriental College and the
pine trees about it had gone, and very far away, lit by a vivid red
glare, the common about the sand-pits was visible. Across the light
huge black shapes, grotesque and strange, moved busily to and fro.

It seemed indeed as if the whole country in that direction was on
fire—a broad hillside set with minute tongues of flame, swaying and
writhing with the gusts of the dying storm, and throwing a red
reflection upon the cloud scud above. Every now and then a haze of
smoke from some nearer conflagration drove across the window and hid
the Martian shapes. I could not see what they were doing, nor the clear
form of them, nor recognise the black objects they were busied upon.
Neither could I see the nearer fire, though the reflections of it
danced on the wall and ceiling of the study. A sharp, resinous tang of
burning was in the air.

I closed the door noiselessly and crept towards the window. As I did
so, the view opened out until, on the one hand, it reached to the
houses about Woking station, and on the other to the charred and
blackened pine woods of Byfleet. There was a light down below the hill,
on the railway, near the arch, and several of the houses along the
Maybury road and the streets near the station were glowing ruins. The
light upon the railway puzzled me at first; there were a black heap and
a vivid glare, and to the right of that a row of yellow oblongs. Then I
perceived this was a wrecked train, the fore part smashed and on fire,
the hinder carriages still upon the rails.

Between these three main centres of light—the houses, the train, and
the burning county towards Chobham—stretched irregular patches of dark
country, broken here and there by intervals of dimly glowing and
smoking ground. It was the strangest spectacle, that black expanse set
with fire. It reminded me, more than anything else, of the Potteries at
night. At first I could distinguish no people at all, though I peered
intently for them. Later I saw against the light of Woking station a
number of black figures hurrying one after the other across the line.

And this was the little world in which I had been living securely for
years, this fiery chaos! What had happened in the last seven hours I
still did not know; nor did I know, though I was beginning to guess,
the relation between these mechanical colossi and the sluggish lumps I
had seen disgorged from the cylinder. With a queer feeling of
impersonal interest I turned my desk chair to the window, sat down, and
stared at the blackened country, and particularly at the three gigantic
black things that were going to and fro in the glare about the
sand-pits.

They seemed amazingly busy. I began to ask myself what they could be.
Were they intelligent mechanisms? Such a thing I felt was impossible.
Or did a Martian sit within each, ruling, directing, using, much as a
man’s brain sits and rules in his body? I began to compare the things
to human machines, to ask myself for the first time in my life how an
ironclad or a steam engine would seem to an intelligent lower animal.

The storm had left the sky clear, and over the smoke of the burning
land the little fading pinpoint of Mars was dropping into the west,
when a soldier came into my garden. I heard a slight scraping at the
fence, and rousing myself from the lethargy that had fallen upon me, I
looked down and saw him dimly, clambering over the palings. At the
sight of another human being my torpor passed, and I leaned out of the
window eagerly.

“Hist!” said I, in a whisper.

He stopped astride of the fence in doubt. Then he came over and across
the lawn to the corner of the house. He bent down and stepped softly.

“Who’s there?” he said, also whispering, standing under the window and
peering up.

“Where are you going?” I asked.

“God knows.”

“Are you trying to hide?”

“That’s it.”

“Come into the house,” I said.

I went down, unfastened the door, and let him in, and locked the door
again. I could not see his face. He was hatless, and his coat was
unbuttoned.

“My God!” he said, as I drew him in.

“What has happened?” I asked.

“What hasn’t?” In the obscurity I could see he made a gesture of
despair. “They wiped us out—simply wiped us out,” he repeated again and
again.

He followed me, almost mechanically, into the dining room.

“Take some whisky,” I said, pouring out a stiff dose.

He drank it. Then abruptly he sat down before the table, put his head
on his arms, and began to sob and weep like a little boy, in a perfect
passion of emotion, while I, with a curious forgetfulness of my own
recent despair, stood beside him, wondering.

It was a long time before he could steady his nerves to answer my
questions, and then he answered perplexingly and brokenly. He was a
driver in the artillery, and had only come into action about seven. At
that time firing was going on across the common, and it was said the
first party of Martians were crawling slowly towards their second
cylinder under cover of a metal shield.

Later this shield staggered up on tripod legs and became the first of
the fighting-machines I had seen. The gun he drove had been unlimbered
near Horsell, in order to command the sand-pits, and its arrival it was
that had precipitated the action. As the limber gunners went to the
rear, his horse trod in a rabbit hole and came down, throwing him into
a depression of the ground. At the same moment the gun exploded behind
him, the ammunition blew up, there was fire all about him, and he found
himself lying under a heap of charred dead men and dead horses.

“I lay still,” he said, “scared out of my wits, with the fore quarter
of a horse atop of me. We’d been wiped out. And the smell—good God!
Like burnt meat! I was hurt across the back by the fall of the horse,
and there I had to lie until I felt better. Just like parade it had
been a minute before—then stumble, bang, swish!”

“Wiped out!” he said.

He had hid under the dead horse for a long time, peeping out furtively
across the common. The Cardigan men had tried a rush, in skirmishing
order, at the pit, simply to be swept out of existence. Then the
monster had risen to its feet and had begun to walk leisurely to and
fro across the common among the few fugitives, with its headlike hood
turning about exactly like the head of a cowled human being. A kind of
arm carried a complicated metallic case, about which green flashes
scintillated, and out of the funnel of this there smoked the Heat-Ray.

In a few minutes there was, so far as the soldier could see, not a
living thing left upon the common, and every bush and tree upon it that
was not already a blackened skeleton was burning. The hussars had been
on the road beyond the curvature of the ground, and he saw nothing of
them. He heard the Maxims rattle for a time and then become still. The
giant saved Woking station and its cluster of houses until the last;
then in a moment the Heat-Ray was brought to bear, and the town became
a heap of fiery ruins. Then the Thing shut off the Heat-Ray, and
turning its back upon the artilleryman, began to waddle away towards
the smouldering pine woods that sheltered the second cylinder. As it
did so a second glittering Titan built itself up out of the pit.

The second monster followed the first, and at that the artilleryman
began to crawl very cautiously across the hot heather ash towards
Horsell. He managed to get alive into the ditch by the side of the
road, and so escaped to Woking. There his story became ejaculatory. The
place was impassable. It seems there were a few people alive there,
frantic for the most part and many burned and scalded. He was turned
aside by the fire, and hid among some almost scorching heaps of broken
wall as one of the Martian giants returned. He saw this one pursue a
man, catch him up in one of its steely tentacles, and knock his head
against the trunk of a pine tree. At last, after nightfall, the
artilleryman made a rush for it and got over the railway embankment.

Since then he had been skulking along towards Maybury, in the hope of
getting out of danger Londonward. People were hiding in trenches and
cellars, and many of the survivors had made off towards Woking village
and Send. He had been consumed with thirst until he found one of the
water mains near the railway arch smashed, and the water bubbling out
like a spring upon the road.

That was the story I got from him, bit by bit. He grew calmer telling
me and trying to make me see the things he had seen. He had eaten no
food since midday, he told me early in his narrative, and I found some
mutton and bread in the pantry and brought it into the room. We lit no
lamp for fear of attracting the Martians, and ever and again our hands
would touch upon bread or meat. As he talked, things about us came
darkly out of the darkness, and the trampled bushes and broken rose
trees outside the window grew distinct. It would seem that a number of
men or animals had rushed across the lawn. I began to see his face,
blackened and haggard, as no doubt mine was also.

When we had finished eating we went softly upstairs to my study, and I
looked again out of the open window. In one night the valley had become
a valley of ashes. The fires had dwindled now. Where flames had been
there were now streamers of smoke; but the countless ruins of shattered
and gutted houses and blasted and blackened trees that the night had
hidden stood out now gaunt and terrible in the pitiless light of dawn.
Yet here and there some object had had the luck to escape—a white
railway signal here, the end of a greenhouse there, white and fresh
amid the wreckage. Never before in the history of warfare had
destruction been so indiscriminate and so universal. And shining with
the growing light of the east, three of the metallic giants stood about
the pit, their cowls rotating as though they were surveying the
desolation they had made.

It seemed to me that the pit had been enlarged, and ever and again
puffs of vivid green vapour streamed up and out of it towards the
brightening dawn—streamed up, whirled, broke, and vanished.

Beyond were the pillars of fire about Chobham. They became pillars of
bloodshot smoke at the first touch of day.




XII.
WHAT I SAW OF THE DESTRUCTION OF WEYBRIDGE AND SHEPPERTON.


As the dawn grew brighter we withdrew from the window from which we had
watched the Martians, and went very quietly downstairs.

The artilleryman agreed with me that the house was no place to stay in.
He proposed, he said, to make his way Londonward, and thence rejoin his
battery—No. 12, of the Horse Artillery. My plan was to return at once
to Leatherhead; and so greatly had the strength of the Martians
impressed me that I had determined to take my wife to Newhaven, and go
with her out of the country forthwith. For I already perceived clearly
that the country about London must inevitably be the scene of a
disastrous struggle before such creatures as these could be destroyed.

Between us and Leatherhead, however, lay the third cylinder, with its
guarding giants. Had I been alone, I think I should have taken my
chance and struck across country. But the artilleryman dissuaded me:
“It’s no kindness to the right sort of wife,” he said, “to make her a
widow”; and in the end I agreed to go with him, under cover of the
woods, northward as far as Street Cobham before I parted with him.
Thence I would make a big detour by Epsom to reach Leatherhead.

I should have started at once, but my companion had been in active
service and he knew better than that. He made me ransack the house for
a flask, which he filled with whisky; and we lined every available
pocket with packets of biscuits and slices of meat. Then we crept out
of the house, and ran as quickly as we could down the ill-made road by
which I had come overnight. The houses seemed deserted. In the road lay
a group of three charred bodies close together, struck dead by the
Heat-Ray; and here and there were things that people had dropped—a
clock, a slipper, a silver spoon, and the like poor valuables. At the
corner turning up towards the post office a little cart, filled with
boxes and furniture, and horseless, heeled over on a broken wheel. A
cash box had been hastily smashed open and thrown under the debris.

Except the lodge at the Orphanage, which was still on fire, none of the
houses had suffered very greatly here. The Heat-Ray had shaved the
chimney tops and passed. Yet, save ourselves, there did not seem to be
a living soul on Maybury Hill. The majority of the inhabitants had
escaped, I suppose, by way of the Old Woking road—the road I had taken
when I drove to Leatherhead—or they had hidden.

We went down the lane, by the body of the man in black, sodden now from
the overnight hail, and broke into the woods at the foot of the hill.
We pushed through these towards the railway without meeting a soul. The
woods across the line were but the scarred and blackened ruins of
woods; for the most part the trees had fallen, but a certain proportion
still stood, dismal grey stems, with dark brown foliage instead of
green.

On our side the fire had done no more than scorch the nearer trees; it
had failed to secure its footing. In one place the woodmen had been at
work on Saturday; trees, felled and freshly trimmed, lay in a clearing,
with heaps of sawdust by the sawing-machine and its engine. Hard by was
a temporary hut, deserted. There was not a breath of wind this morning,
and everything was strangely still. Even the birds were hushed, and as
we hurried along I and the artilleryman talked in whispers and looked
now and again over our shoulders. Once or twice we stopped to listen.

After a time we drew near the road, and as we did so we heard the
clatter of hoofs and saw through the tree stems three cavalry soldiers
riding slowly towards Woking. We hailed them, and they halted while we
hurried towards them. It was a lieutenant and a couple of privates of
the 8th Hussars, with a stand like a theodolite, which the artilleryman
told me was a heliograph.

“You are the first men I’ve seen coming this way this morning,” said
the lieutenant. “What’s brewing?”

His voice and face were eager. The men behind him stared curiously. The
artilleryman jumped down the bank into the road and saluted.

“Gun destroyed last night, sir. Have been hiding. Trying to rejoin
battery, sir. You’ll come in sight of the Martians, I expect, about
half a mile along this road.”

“What the dickens are they like?” asked the lieutenant.

“Giants in armour, sir. Hundred feet high. Three legs and a body like
’luminium, with a mighty great head in a hood, sir.”

“Get out!” said the lieutenant. “What confounded nonsense!”

“You’ll see, sir. They carry a kind of box, sir, that shoots fire and
strikes you dead.”

“What d’ye mean—a gun?”

“No, sir,” and the artilleryman began a vivid account of the Heat-Ray.
Halfway through, the lieutenant interrupted him and looked up at me. I
was still standing on the bank by the side of the road.

“It’s perfectly true,” I said.

“Well,” said the lieutenant, “I suppose it’s my business to see it too.
Look here”—to the artilleryman—“we’re detailed here clearing people out
of their houses. You’d better go along and report yourself to
Brigadier-General Marvin, and tell him all you know. He’s at Weybridge.
Know the way?”

“I do,” I said; and he turned his horse southward again.

“Half a mile, you say?” said he.

“At most,” I answered, and pointed over the treetops southward. He
thanked me and rode on, and we saw them no more.

Farther along we came upon a group of three women and two children in
the road, busy clearing out a labourer’s cottage. They had got hold of
a little hand truck, and were piling it up with unclean-looking bundles
and shabby furniture. They were all too assiduously engaged to talk to
us as we passed.

By Byfleet station we emerged from the pine trees, and found the
country calm and peaceful under the morning sunlight. We were far
beyond the range of the Heat-Ray there, and had it not been for the
silent desertion of some of the houses, the stirring movement of
packing in others, and the knot of soldiers standing on the bridge over
the railway and staring down the line towards Woking, the day would
have seemed very like any other Sunday.

Several farm waggons and carts were moving creakily along the road to
Addlestone, and suddenly through the gate of a field we saw, across a
stretch of flat meadow, six twelve-pounders standing neatly at equal
distances pointing towards Woking. The gunners stood by the guns
waiting, and the ammunition waggons were at a business-like distance.
The men stood almost as if under inspection.

“That’s good!” said I. “They will get one fair shot, at any rate.”

The artilleryman hesitated at the gate.

“I shall go on,” he said.

Farther on towards Weybridge, just over the bridge, there were a number
of men in white fatigue jackets throwing up a long rampart, and more
guns behind.

“It’s bows and arrows against the lightning, anyhow,” said the
artilleryman. “They ’aven’t seen that fire-beam yet.”

The officers who were not actively engaged stood and stared over the
treetops southwestward, and the men digging would stop every now and
again to stare in the same direction.

Byfleet was in a tumult; people packing, and a score of hussars, some
of them dismounted, some on horseback, were hunting them about. Three
or four black government waggons, with crosses in white circles, and an
old omnibus, among other vehicles, were being loaded in the village
street. There were scores of people, most of them sufficiently
sabbatical to have assumed their best clothes. The soldiers were having
the greatest difficulty in making them realise the gravity of their
position. We saw one shrivelled old fellow with a huge box and a score
or more of flower pots containing orchids, angrily expostulating with
the corporal who would leave them behind. I stopped and gripped his
arm.

“Do you know what’s over there?” I said, pointing at the pine tops that
hid the Martians.

“Eh?” said he, turning. “I was explainin’ these is vallyble.”

“Death!” I shouted. “Death is coming! Death!” and leaving him to digest
that if he could, I hurried on after the artillery-man. At the corner I
looked back. The soldier had left him, and he was still standing by his
box, with the pots of orchids on the lid of it, and staring vaguely
over the trees.

No one in Weybridge could tell us where the headquarters were
established; the whole place was in such confusion as I had never seen
in any town before. Carts, carriages everywhere, the most astonishing
miscellany of conveyances and horseflesh. The respectable inhabitants
of the place, men in golf and boating costumes, wives prettily dressed,
were packing, river-side loafers energetically helping, children
excited, and, for the most part, highly delighted at this astonishing
variation of their Sunday experiences. In the midst of it all the
worthy vicar was very pluckily holding an early celebration, and his
bell was jangling out above the excitement.

I and the artilleryman, seated on the step of the drinking fountain,
made a very passable meal upon what we had brought with us. Patrols of
soldiers—here no longer hussars, but grenadiers in white—were warning
people to move now or to take refuge in their cellars as soon as the
firing began. We saw as we crossed the railway bridge that a growing
crowd of people had assembled in and about the railway station, and the
swarming platform was piled with boxes and packages. The ordinary
traffic had been stopped, I believe, in order to allow of the passage
of troops and guns to Chertsey, and I have heard since that a savage
struggle occurred for places in the special trains that were put on at
a later hour.

We remained at Weybridge until midday, and at that hour we found
ourselves at the place near Shepperton Lock where the Wey and Thames
join. Part of the time we spent helping two old women to pack a little
cart. The Wey has a treble mouth, and at this point boats are to be
hired, and there was a ferry across the river. On the Shepperton side
was an inn with a lawn, and beyond that the tower of Shepperton
Church—it has been replaced by a spire—rose above the trees.

Here we found an excited and noisy crowd of fugitives. As yet the
flight had not grown to a panic, but there were already far more people
than all the boats going to and fro could enable to cross. People came
panting along under heavy burdens; one husband and wife were even
carrying a small outhouse door between them, with some of their
household goods piled thereon. One man told us he meant to try to get
away from Shepperton station.

There was a lot of shouting, and one man was even jesting. The idea
people seemed to have here was that the Martians were simply formidable
human beings, who might attack and sack the town, to be certainly
destroyed in the end. Every now and then people would glance nervously
across the Wey, at the meadows towards Chertsey, but everything over
there was still.

Across the Thames, except just where the boats landed, everything was
quiet, in vivid contrast with the Surrey side. The people who landed
there from the boats went tramping off down the lane. The big ferryboat
had just made a journey. Three or four soldiers stood on the lawn of
the inn, staring and jesting at the fugitives, without offering to
help. The inn was closed, as it was now within prohibited hours.

“What’s that?” cried a boatman, and “Shut up, you fool!” said a man
near me to a yelping dog. Then the sound came again, this time from the
direction of Chertsey, a muffled thud—the sound of a gun.

The fighting was beginning. Almost immediately unseen batteries across
the river to our right, unseen because of the trees, took up the
chorus, firing heavily one after the other. A woman screamed. Everyone
stood arrested by the sudden stir of battle, near us and yet invisible
to us. Nothing was to be seen save flat meadows, cows feeding
unconcernedly for the most part, and silvery pollard willows motionless
in the warm sunlight.

“The sojers’ll stop ’em,” said a woman beside me, doubtfully. A
haziness rose over the treetops.

Then suddenly we saw a rush of smoke far away up the river, a puff of
smoke that jerked up into the air and hung; and forthwith the ground
heaved under foot and a heavy explosion shook the air, smashing two or
three windows in the houses near, and leaving us astonished.

“Here they are!” shouted a man in a blue jersey. “Yonder! D’yer see
them? Yonder!”

Quickly, one after the other, one, two, three, four of the armoured
Martians appeared, far away over the little trees, across the flat
meadows that stretched towards Chertsey, and striding hurriedly towards
the river. Little cowled figures they seemed at first, going with a
rolling motion and as fast as flying birds.

Then, advancing obliquely towards us, came a fifth. Their armoured
bodies glittered in the sun as they swept swiftly forward upon the
guns, growing rapidly larger as they drew nearer. One on the extreme
left, the remotest that is, flourished a huge case high in the air, and
the ghostly, terrible Heat-Ray I had already seen on Friday night smote
towards Chertsey, and struck the town.

At sight of these strange, swift, and terrible creatures the crowd near
the water’s edge seemed to me to be for a moment horror-struck. There
was no screaming or shouting, but a silence. Then a hoarse murmur and a
movement of feet—a splashing from the water. A man, too frightened to
drop the portmanteau he carried on his shoulder, swung round and sent
me staggering with a blow from the corner of his burden. A woman thrust
at me with her hand and rushed past me. I turned with the rush of the
people, but I was not too terrified for thought. The terrible Heat-Ray
was in my mind. To get under water! That was it!

“Get under water!” I shouted, unheeded.

I faced about again, and rushed towards the approaching Martian, rushed
right down the gravelly beach and headlong into the water. Others did
the same. A boatload of people putting back came leaping out as I
rushed past. The stones under my feet were muddy and slippery, and the
river was so low that I ran perhaps twenty feet scarcely waist-deep.
Then, as the Martian towered overhead scarcely a couple of hundred
yards away, I flung myself forward under the surface. The splashes of
the people in the boats leaping into the river sounded like
thunderclaps in my ears. People were landing hastily on both sides of
the river. But the Martian machine took no more notice for the moment
of the people running this way and that than a man would of the
confusion of ants in a nest against which his foot has kicked. When,
half suffocated, I raised my head above water, the Martian’s hood
pointed at the batteries that were still firing across the river, and
as it advanced it swung loose what must have been the generator of the
Heat-Ray.

In another moment it was on the bank, and in a stride wading halfway
across. The knees of its foremost legs bent at the farther bank, and in
another moment it had raised itself to its full height again, close to
the village of Shepperton. Forthwith the six guns which, unknown to
anyone on the right bank, had been hidden behind the outskirts of that
village, fired simultaneously. The sudden near concussion, the last
close upon the first, made my heart jump. The monster was already
raising the case generating the Heat-Ray as the first shell burst six
yards above the hood.

I gave a cry of astonishment. I saw and thought nothing of the other
four Martian monsters; my attention was riveted upon the nearer
incident. Simultaneously two other shells burst in the air near the
body as the hood twisted round in time to receive, but not in time to
dodge, the fourth shell.

The shell burst clean in the face of the Thing. The hood bulged,
flashed, was whirled off in a dozen tattered fragments of red flesh and
glittering metal.

“Hit!” shouted I, with something between a scream and a cheer.

I heard answering shouts from the people in the water about me. I could
have leaped out of the water with that momentary exultation.

The decapitated colossus reeled like a drunken giant; but it did not
fall over. It recovered its balance by a miracle, and, no longer
heeding its steps and with the camera that fired the Heat-Ray now
rigidly upheld, it reeled swiftly upon Shepperton. The living
intelligence, the Martian within the hood, was slain and splashed to
the four winds of heaven, and the Thing was now but a mere intricate
device of metal whirling to destruction. It drove along in a straight
line, incapable of guidance. It struck the tower of Shepperton Church,
smashing it down as the impact of a battering ram might have done,
swerved aside, blundered on and collapsed with tremendous force into
the river out of my sight.

A violent explosion shook the air, and a spout of water, steam, mud,
and shattered metal shot far up into the sky. As the camera of the
Heat-Ray hit the water, the latter had immediately flashed into steam.
In another moment a huge wave, like a muddy tidal bore but almost
scaldingly hot, came sweeping round the bend upstream. I saw people
struggling shorewards, and heard their screaming and shouting faintly
above the seething and roar of the Martian’s collapse.

For a moment I heeded nothing of the heat, forgot the patent need of
self-preservation. I splashed through the tumultuous water, pushing
aside a man in black to do so, until I could see round the bend. Half a
dozen deserted boats pitched aimlessly upon the confusion of the waves.
The fallen Martian came into sight downstream, lying across the river,
and for the most part submerged.

Thick clouds of steam were pouring off the wreckage, and through the
tumultuously whirling wisps I could see, intermittently and vaguely,
the gigantic limbs churning the water and flinging a splash and spray
of mud and froth into the air. The tentacles swayed and struck like
living arms, and, save for the helpless purposelessness of these
movements, it was as if some wounded thing were struggling for its life
amid the waves. Enormous quantities of a ruddy-brown fluid were
spurting up in noisy jets out of the machine.

My attention was diverted from this death flurry by a furious yelling,
like that of the thing called a siren in our manufacturing towns. A
man, knee-deep near the towing path, shouted inaudibly to me and
pointed. Looking back, I saw the other Martians advancing with gigantic
strides down the riverbank from the direction of Chertsey. The
Shepperton guns spoke this time unavailingly.

At that I ducked at once under water, and, holding my breath until
movement was an agony, blundered painfully ahead under the surface as
long as I could. The water was in a tumult about me, and rapidly
growing hotter.

When for a moment I raised my head to take breath and throw the hair
and water from my eyes, the steam was rising in a whirling white fog
that at first hid the Martians altogether. The noise was deafening.
Then I saw them dimly, colossal figures of grey, magnified by the mist.
They had passed by me, and two were stooping over the frothing,
tumultuous ruins of their comrade.

The third and fourth stood beside him in the water, one perhaps two
hundred yards from me, the other towards Laleham. The generators of the
Heat-Rays waved high, and the hissing beams smote down this way and
that.

The air was full of sound, a deafening and confusing conflict of
noises—the clangorous din of the Martians, the crash of falling houses,
the thud of trees, fences, sheds flashing into flame, and the crackling
and roaring of fire. Dense black smoke was leaping up to mingle with
the steam from the river, and as the Heat-Ray went to and fro over
Weybridge its impact was marked by flashes of incandescent white, that
gave place at once to a smoky dance of lurid flames. The nearer houses
still stood intact, awaiting their fate, shadowy, faint and pallid in
the steam, with the fire behind them going to and fro.

For a moment perhaps I stood there, breast-high in the almost boiling
water, dumbfounded at my position, hopeless of escape. Through the reek
I could see the people who had been with me in the river scrambling out
of the water through the reeds, like little frogs hurrying through
grass from the advance of a man, or running to and fro in utter dismay
on the towing path.

Then suddenly the white flashes of the Heat-Ray came leaping towards
me. The houses caved in as they dissolved at its touch, and darted out
flames; the trees changed to fire with a roar. The Ray flickered up and
down the towing path, licking off the people who ran this way and that,
and came down to the water’s edge not fifty yards from where I stood.
It swept across the river to Shepperton, and the water in its track
rose in a boiling weal crested with steam. I turned shoreward.

In another moment the huge wave, well-nigh at the boiling-point had
rushed upon me. I screamed aloud, and scalded, half blinded, agonised,
I staggered through the leaping, hissing water towards the shore. Had
my foot stumbled, it would have been the end. I fell helplessly, in
full sight of the Martians, upon the broad, bare gravelly spit that
runs down to mark the angle of the Wey and Thames. I expected nothing
but death.

I have a dim memory of the foot of a Martian coming down within a score
of yards of my head, driving straight into the loose gravel, whirling
it this way and that and lifting again; of a long suspense, and then of
the four carrying the debris of their comrade between them, now clear
and then presently faint through a veil of smoke, receding
interminably, as it seemed to me, across a vast space of river and
meadow. And then, very slowly, I realised that by a miracle I had
escaped.




XIII.
HOW I FELL IN WITH THE CURATE.


After getting this sudden lesson in the power of terrestrial weapons,
the Martians retreated to their original position upon Horsell Common;
and in their haste, and encumbered with the debris of their smashed
companion, they no doubt overlooked many such a stray and negligible
victim as myself. Had they left their comrade and pushed on forthwith,
there was nothing at that time between them and London but batteries of
twelve-pounder guns, and they would certainly have reached the capital
in advance of the tidings of their approach; as sudden, dreadful, and
destructive their advent would have been as the earthquake that
destroyed Lisbon a century ago.

But they were in no hurry. Cylinder followed cylinder on its
interplanetary flight; every twenty-four hours brought them
reinforcement. And meanwhile the military and naval authorities, now
fully alive to the tremendous power of their antagonists, worked with
furious energy. Every minute a fresh gun came into position until,
before twilight, every copse, every row of suburban villas on the hilly
slopes about Kingston and Richmond, masked an expectant black muzzle.
And through the charred and desolated area—perhaps twenty square miles
altogether—that encircled the Martian encampment on Horsell Common,
through charred and ruined villages among the green trees, through the
blackened and smoking arcades that had been but a day ago pine
spinneys, crawled the devoted scouts with the heliographs that were
presently to warn the gunners of the Martian approach. But the Martians
now understood our command of artillery and the danger of human
proximity, and not a man ventured within a mile of either cylinder,
save at the price of his life.

It would seem that these giants spent the earlier part of the afternoon
in going to and fro, transferring everything from the second and third
cylinders—the second in Addlestone Golf Links and the third at
Pyrford—to their original pit on Horsell Common. Over that, above the
blackened heather and ruined buildings that stretched far and wide,
stood one as sentinel, while the rest abandoned their vast
fighting-machines and descended into the pit. They were hard at work
there far into the night, and the towering pillar of dense green smoke
that rose therefrom could be seen from the hills about Merrow, and
even, it is said, from Banstead and Epsom Downs.

And while the Martians behind me were thus preparing for their next
sally, and in front of me Humanity gathered for the battle, I made my
way with infinite pains and labour from the fire and smoke of burning
Weybridge towards London.

I saw an abandoned boat, very small and remote, drifting down-stream;
and throwing off the most of my sodden clothes, I went after it, gained
it, and so escaped out of that destruction. There were no oars in the
boat, but I contrived to paddle, as well as my parboiled hands would
allow, down the river towards Halliford and Walton, going very
tediously and continually looking behind me, as you may well
understand. I followed the river, because I considered that the water
gave me my best chance of escape should these giants return.

The hot water from the Martian’s overthrow drifted downstream with me,
so that for the best part of a mile I could see little of either bank.
Once, however, I made out a string of black figures hurrying across the
meadows from the direction of Weybridge. Halliford, it seemed, was
deserted, and several of the houses facing the river were on fire. It
was strange to see the place quite tranquil, quite desolate under the
hot blue sky, with the smoke and little threads of flame going straight
up into the heat of the afternoon. Never before had I seen houses
burning without the accompaniment of an obstructive crowd. A little
farther on the dry reeds up the bank were smoking and glowing, and a
line of fire inland was marching steadily across a late field of hay.

For a long time I drifted, so painful and weary was I after the
violence I had been through, and so intense the heat upon the water.
Then my fears got the better of me again, and I resumed my paddling.
The sun scorched my bare back. At last, as the bridge at Walton was
coming into sight round the bend, my fever and faintness overcame my
fears, and I landed on the Middlesex bank and lay down, deadly sick,
amid the long grass. I suppose the time was then about four or five
o’clock. I got up presently, walked perhaps half a mile without meeting
a soul, and then lay down again in the shadow of a hedge. I seem to
remember talking, wanderingly, to myself during that last spurt. I was
also very thirsty, and bitterly regretful I had drunk no more water. It
is a curious thing that I felt angry with my wife; I cannot account for
it, but my impotent desire to reach Leatherhead worried me excessively.

I do not clearly remember the arrival of the curate, so that probably I
dozed. I became aware of him as a seated figure in soot-smudged shirt
sleeves, and with his upturned, clean-shaven face staring at a faint
flickering that danced over the sky. The sky was what is called a
mackerel sky—rows and rows of faint down-plumes of cloud, just tinted
with the midsummer sunset.

I sat up, and at the rustle of my motion he looked at me quickly.

“Have you any water?” I asked abruptly.

He shook his head.

“You have been asking for water for the last hour,” he said.

For a moment we were silent, taking stock of each other. I dare say he
found me a strange enough figure, naked, save for my water-soaked
trousers and socks, scalded, and my face and shoulders blackened by the
smoke. His face was a fair weakness, his chin retreated, and his hair
lay in crisp, almost flaxen curls on his low forehead; his eyes were
rather large, pale blue, and blankly staring. He spoke abruptly,
looking vacantly away from me.

“What does it mean?” he said. “What do these things mean?”

I stared at him and made no answer.

He extended a thin white hand and spoke in almost a complaining tone.

“Why are these things permitted? What sins have we done? The morning
service was over, I was walking through the roads to clear my brain for
the afternoon, and then—fire, earthquake, death! As if it were Sodom
and Gomorrah! All our work undone, all the work—— What are these
Martians?”

“What are we?” I answered, clearing my throat.

He gripped his knees and turned to look at me again. For half a minute,
perhaps, he stared silently.

“I was walking through the roads to clear my brain,” he said. “And
suddenly—fire, earthquake, death!”

He relapsed into silence, with his chin now sunken almost to his knees.

Presently he began waving his hand.

“All the work—all the Sunday schools—What have we done—what has
Weybridge done? Everything gone—everything destroyed. The church! We
rebuilt it only three years ago. Gone! Swept out of existence! Why?”

Another pause, and he broke out again like one demented.

“The smoke of her burning goeth up for ever and ever!” he shouted.

His eyes flamed, and he pointed a lean finger in the direction of
Weybridge.

By this time I was beginning to take his measure. The tremendous
tragedy in which he had been involved—it was evident he was a fugitive
from Weybridge—had driven him to the very verge of his reason.

“Are we far from Sunbury?” I said, in a matter-of-fact tone.

“What are we to do?” he asked. “Are these creatures everywhere? Has the
earth been given over to them?”

“Are we far from Sunbury?”

“Only this morning I officiated at early celebration——”

“Things have changed,” I said, quietly. “You must keep your head. There
is still hope.”

“Hope!”

“Yes. Plentiful hope—for all this destruction!”

I began to explain my view of our position. He listened at first, but
as I went on the interest dawning in his eyes gave place to their
former stare, and his regard wandered from me.

“This must be the beginning of the end,” he said, interrupting me. “The
end! The great and terrible day of the Lord! When men shall call upon
the mountains and the rocks to fall upon them and hide them—hide them
from the face of Him that sitteth upon the throne!”

I began to understand the position. I ceased my laboured reasoning,
struggled to my feet, and, standing over him, laid my hand on his
shoulder.

“Be a man!” said I. “You are scared out of your wits! What good is
religion if it collapses under calamity? Think of what earthquakes and
floods, wars and volcanoes, have done before to men! Did you think God
had exempted Weybridge? He is not an insurance agent.”

For a time he sat in blank silence.

“But how can we escape?” he asked, suddenly. “They are invulnerable,
they are pitiless.”

“Neither the one nor, perhaps, the other,” I answered. “And the
mightier they are the more sane and wary should we be. One of them was
killed yonder not three hours ago.”

“Killed!” he said, staring about him. “How can God’s ministers be
killed?”

“I saw it happen.” I proceeded to tell him. “We have chanced to come in
for the thick of it,” said I, “and that is all.”

“What is that flicker in the sky?” he asked abruptly.

I told him it was the heliograph signalling—that it was the sign of
human help and effort in the sky.

“We are in the midst of it,” I said, “quiet as it is. That flicker in
the sky tells of the gathering storm. Yonder, I take it are the
Martians, and Londonward, where those hills rise about Richmond and
Kingston and the trees give cover, earthworks are being thrown up and
guns are being placed. Presently the Martians will be coming this way
again.”

And even as I spoke he sprang to his feet and stopped me by a gesture.

“Listen!” he said.

From beyond the low hills across the water came the dull resonance of
distant guns and a remote weird crying. Then everything was still. A
cockchafer came droning over the hedge and past us. High in the west
the crescent moon hung faint and pale above the smoke of Weybridge and
Shepperton and the hot, still splendour of the sunset.

“We had better follow this path,” I said, “northward.”




XIV.
IN LONDON.


My younger brother was in London when the Martians fell at Woking. He
was a medical student working for an imminent examination, and he heard
nothing of the arrival until Saturday morning. The morning papers on
Saturday contained, in addition to lengthy special articles on the
planet Mars, on life in the planets, and so forth, a brief and vaguely
worded telegram, all the more striking for its brevity.

The Martians, alarmed by the approach of a crowd, had killed a number
of people with a quick-firing gun, so the story ran. The telegram
concluded with the words: “Formidable as they seem to be, the Martians
have not moved from the pit into which they have fallen, and, indeed,
seem incapable of doing so. Probably this is due to the relative
strength of the earth’s gravitational energy.” On that last text their
leader-writer expanded very comfortingly.

Of course all the students in the crammer’s biology class, to which my
brother went that day, were intensely interested, but there were no
signs of any unusual excitement in the streets. The afternoon papers
puffed scraps of news under big headlines. They had nothing to tell
beyond the movements of troops about the common, and the burning of the
pine woods between Woking and Weybridge, until eight. Then the _St.
James’s Gazette_, in an extra-special edition, announced the bare fact
of the interruption of telegraphic communication. This was thought to
be due to the falling of burning pine trees across the line. Nothing
more of the fighting was known that night, the night of my drive to
Leatherhead and back.

My brother felt no anxiety about us, as he knew from the description in
the papers that the cylinder was a good two miles from my house. He
made up his mind to run down that night to me, in order, as he says, to
see the Things before they were killed. He dispatched a telegram, which
never reached me, about four o’clock, and spent the evening at a music
hall.

In London, also, on Saturday night there was a thunderstorm, and my
brother reached Waterloo in a cab. On the platform from which the
midnight train usually starts he learned, after some waiting, that an
accident prevented trains from reaching Woking that night. The nature
of the accident he could not ascertain; indeed, the railway authorities
did not clearly know at that time. There was very little excitement in
the station, as the officials, failing to realise that anything further
than a breakdown between Byfleet and Woking junction had occurred, were
running the theatre trains which usually passed through Woking round by
Virginia Water or Guildford. They were busy making the necessary
arrangements to alter the route of the Southampton and Portsmouth
Sunday League excursions. A nocturnal newspaper reporter, mistaking my
brother for the traffic manager, to whom he bears a slight resemblance,
waylaid and tried to interview him. Few people, excepting the railway
officials, connected the breakdown with the Martians.

I have read, in another account of these events, that on Sunday morning
“all London was electrified by the news from Woking.” As a matter of
fact, there was nothing to justify that very extravagant phrase. Plenty
of Londoners did not hear of the Martians until the panic of Monday
morning. Those who did took some time to realise all that the hastily
worded telegrams in the Sunday papers conveyed. The majority of people
in London do not read Sunday papers.

The habit of personal security, moreover, is so deeply fixed in the
Londoner’s mind, and startling intelligence so much a matter of course
in the papers, that they could read without any personal tremors:
“About seven o’clock last night the Martians came out of the cylinder,
and, moving about under an armour of metallic shields, have completely
wrecked Woking station with the adjacent houses, and massacred an
entire battalion of the Cardigan Regiment. No details are known. Maxims
have been absolutely useless against their armour; the field guns have
been disabled by them. Flying hussars have been galloping into
Chertsey. The Martians appear to be moving slowly towards Chertsey or
Windsor. Great anxiety prevails in West Surrey, and earthworks are
being thrown up to check the advance Londonward.” That was how the
_Sunday Sun_ put it, and a clever and remarkably prompt “handbook”
article in the _Referee_ compared the affair to a menagerie suddenly
let loose in a village.

No one in London knew positively of the nature of the armoured
Martians, and there was still a fixed idea that these monsters must be
sluggish: “crawling,” “creeping painfully”—such expressions occurred in
almost all the earlier reports. None of the telegrams could have been
written by an eyewitness of their advance. The Sunday papers printed
separate editions as further news came to hand, some even in default of
it. But there was practically nothing more to tell people until late in
the afternoon, when the authorities gave the press agencies the news in
their possession. It was stated that the people of Walton and
Weybridge, and all the district were pouring along the roads
Londonward, and that was all.

My brother went to church at the Foundling Hospital in the morning,
still in ignorance of what had happened on the previous night. There he
heard allusions made to the invasion, and a special prayer for peace.
Coming out, he bought a _Referee_. He became alarmed at the news in
this, and went again to Waterloo station to find out if communication
were restored. The omnibuses, carriages, cyclists, and innumerable
people walking in their best clothes seemed scarcely affected by the
strange intelligence that the newsvendors were disseminating. People
were interested, or, if alarmed, alarmed only on account of the local
residents. At the station he heard for the first time that the Windsor
and Chertsey lines were now interrupted. The porters told him that
several remarkable telegrams had been received in the morning from
Byfleet and Chertsey stations, but that these had abruptly ceased. My
brother could get very little precise detail out of them.

“There’s fighting going on about Weybridge” was the extent of their
information.

The train service was now very much disorganised. Quite a number of
people who had been expecting friends from places on the South-Western
network were standing about the station. One grey-headed old gentleman
came and abused the South-Western Company bitterly to my brother. “It
wants showing up,” he said.

One or two trains came in from Richmond, Putney, and Kingston,
containing people who had gone out for a day’s boating and found the
locks closed and a feeling of panic in the air. A man in a blue and
white blazer addressed my brother, full of strange tidings.

“There’s hosts of people driving into Kingston in traps and carts and
things, with boxes of valuables and all that,” he said. “They come from
Molesey and Weybridge and Walton, and they say there’s been guns heard
at Chertsey, heavy firing, and that mounted soldiers have told them to
get off at once because the Martians are coming. We heard guns firing
at Hampton Court station, but we thought it was thunder. What the
dickens does it all mean? The Martians can’t get out of their pit, can
they?”

My brother could not tell him.

Afterwards he found that the vague feeling of alarm had spread to the
clients of the underground railway, and that the Sunday excursionists
began to return from all over the South-Western “lung”—Barnes,
Wimbledon, Richmond Park, Kew, and so forth—at unnaturally early hours;
but not a soul had anything more than vague hearsay to tell of.
Everyone connected with the terminus seemed ill-tempered.

About five o’clock the gathering crowd in the station was immensely
excited by the opening of the line of communication, which is almost
invariably closed, between the South-Eastern and the South-Western
stations, and the passage of carriage trucks bearing huge guns and
carriages crammed with soldiers. These were the guns that were brought
up from Woolwich and Chatham to cover Kingston. There was an exchange
of pleasantries: “You’ll get eaten!” “We’re the beast-tamers!” and so
forth. A little while after that a squad of police came into the
station and began to clear the public off the platforms, and my brother
went out into the street again.

The church bells were ringing for evensong, and a squad of Salvation
Army lassies came singing down Waterloo Road. On the bridge a number of
loafers were watching a curious brown scum that came drifting down the
stream in patches. The sun was just setting, and the Clock Tower and
the Houses of Parliament rose against one of the most peaceful skies it
is possible to imagine, a sky of gold, barred with long transverse
stripes of reddish-purple cloud. There was talk of a floating body. One
of the men there, a reservist he said he was, told my brother he had
seen the heliograph flickering in the west.

In Wellington Street my brother met a couple of sturdy roughs who had
just been rushed out of Fleet Street with still-wet newspapers and
staring placards. “Dreadful catastrophe!” they bawled one to the other
down Wellington Street. “Fighting at Weybridge! Full description!
Repulse of the Martians! London in Danger!” He had to give threepence
for a copy of that paper.

Then it was, and then only, that he realised something of the full
power and terror of these monsters. He learned that they were not
merely a handful of small sluggish creatures, but that they were minds
swaying vast mechanical bodies; and that they could move swiftly and
smite with such power that even the mightiest guns could not stand
against them.

They were described as “vast spiderlike machines, nearly a hundred feet
high, capable of the speed of an express train, and able to shoot out a
beam of intense heat.” Masked batteries, chiefly of field guns, had
been planted in the country about Horsell Common, and especially
between the Woking district and London. Five of the machines had been
seen moving towards the Thames, and one, by a happy chance, had been
destroyed. In the other cases the shells had missed, and the batteries
had been at once annihilated by the Heat-Rays. Heavy losses of soldiers
were mentioned, but the tone of the dispatch was optimistic.

The Martians had been repulsed; they were not invulnerable. They had
retreated to their triangle of cylinders again, in the circle about
Woking. Signallers with heliographs were pushing forward upon them from
all sides. Guns were in rapid transit from Windsor, Portsmouth,
Aldershot, Woolwich—even from the north; among others, long wire-guns
of ninety-five tons from Woolwich. Altogether one hundred and sixteen
were in position or being hastily placed, chiefly covering London.
Never before in England had there been such a vast or rapid
concentration of military material.

Any further cylinders that fell, it was hoped, could be destroyed at
once by high explosives, which were being rapidly manufactured and
distributed. No doubt, ran the report, the situation was of the
strangest and gravest description, but the public was exhorted to avoid
and discourage panic. No doubt the Martians were strange and terrible
in the extreme, but at the outside there could not be more than twenty
of them against our millions.

The authorities had reason to suppose, from the size of the cylinders,
that at the outside there could not be more than five in each
cylinder—fifteen altogether. And one at least was disposed of—perhaps
more. The public would be fairly warned of the approach of danger, and
elaborate measures were being taken for the protection of the people in
the threatened southwestern suburbs. And so, with reiterated assurances
of the safety of London and the ability of the authorities to cope with
the difficulty, this quasi-proclamation closed.

This was printed in enormous type on paper so fresh that it was still
wet, and there had been no time to add a word of comment. It was
curious, my brother said, to see how ruthlessly the usual contents of
the paper had been hacked and taken out to give this place.

All down Wellington Street people could be seen fluttering out the pink
sheets and reading, and the Strand was suddenly noisy with the voices
of an army of hawkers following these pioneers. Men came scrambling off
buses to secure copies. Certainly this news excited people intensely,
whatever their previous apathy. The shutters of a map shop in the
Strand were being taken down, my brother said, and a man in his Sunday
raiment, lemon-yellow gloves even, was visible inside the window
hastily fastening maps of Surrey to the glass.

Going on along the Strand to Trafalgar Square, the paper in his hand,
my brother saw some of the fugitives from West Surrey. There was a man
with his wife and two boys and some articles of furniture in a cart
such as greengrocers use. He was driving from the direction of
Westminster Bridge; and close behind him came a hay waggon with five or
six respectable-looking people in it, and some boxes and bundles. The
faces of these people were haggard, and their entire appearance
contrasted conspicuously with the Sabbath-best appearance of the people
on the omnibuses. People in fashionable clothing peeped at them out of
cabs. They stopped at the Square as if undecided which way to take, and
finally turned eastward along the Strand. Some way behind these came a
man in workday clothes, riding one of those old-fashioned tricycles
with a small front wheel. He was dirty and white in the face.

My brother turned down towards Victoria, and met a number of such
people. He had a vague idea that he might see something of me. He
noticed an unusual number of police regulating the traffic. Some of the
refugees were exchanging news with the people on the omnibuses. One was
professing to have seen the Martians. “Boilers on stilts, I tell you,
striding along like men.” Most of them were excited and animated by
their strange experience.

Beyond Victoria the public-houses were doing a lively trade with these
arrivals. At all the street corners groups of people were reading
papers, talking excitedly, or staring at these unusual Sunday visitors.
They seemed to increase as night drew on, until at last the roads, my
brother said, were like Epsom High Street on a Derby Day. My brother
addressed several of these fugitives and got unsatisfactory answers
from most.

None of them could tell him any news of Woking except one man, who
assured him that Woking had been entirely destroyed on the previous
night.

“I come from Byfleet,” he said; “a man on a bicycle came through the
place in the early morning, and ran from door to door warning us to
come away. Then came soldiers. We went out to look, and there were
clouds of smoke to the south—nothing but smoke, and not a soul coming
that way. Then we heard the guns at Chertsey, and folks coming from
Weybridge. So I’ve locked up my house and come on.”

At that time there was a strong feeling in the streets that the
authorities were to blame for their incapacity to dispose of the
invaders without all this inconvenience.

About eight o’clock a noise of heavy firing was distinctly audible all
over the south of London. My brother could not hear it for the traffic
in the main thoroughfares, but by striking through the quiet back
streets to the river he was able to distinguish it quite plainly.

He walked from Westminster to his apartments near Regent’s Park, about
two. He was now very anxious on my account, and disturbed at the
evident magnitude of the trouble. His mind was inclined to run, even as
mine had run on Saturday, on military details. He thought of all those
silent, expectant guns, of the suddenly nomadic countryside; he tried
to imagine “boilers on stilts” a hundred feet high.

There were one or two cartloads of refugees passing along Oxford
Street, and several in the Marylebone Road, but so slowly was the news
spreading that Regent Street and Portland Place were full of their
usual Sunday-night promenaders, albeit they talked in groups, and along
the edge of Regent’s Park there were as many silent couples “walking
out” together under the scattered gas lamps as ever there had been. The
night was warm and still, and a little oppressive; the sound of guns
continued intermittently, and after midnight there seemed to be sheet
lightning in the south.

He read and re-read the paper, fearing the worst had happened to me. He
was restless, and after supper prowled out again aimlessly. He returned
and tried in vain to divert his attention to his examination notes. He
went to bed a little after midnight, and was awakened from lurid dreams
in the small hours of Monday by the sound of door knockers, feet
running in the street, distant drumming, and a clamour of bells. Red
reflections danced on the ceiling. For a moment he lay astonished,
wondering whether day had come or the world gone mad. Then he jumped
out of bed and ran to the window.

His room was an attic and as he thrust his head out, up and down the
street there were a dozen echoes to the noise of his window sash, and
heads in every kind of night disarray appeared. Enquiries were being
shouted. “They are coming!” bawled a policeman, hammering at the door;
“the Martians are coming!” and hurried to the next door.

The sound of drumming and trumpeting came from the Albany Street
Barracks, and every church within earshot was hard at work killing
sleep with a vehement disorderly tocsin. There was a noise of doors
opening, and window after window in the houses opposite flashed from
darkness into yellow illumination.

Up the street came galloping a closed carriage, bursting abruptly into
noise at the corner, rising to a clattering climax under the window,
and dying away slowly in the distance. Close on the rear of this came a
couple of cabs, the forerunners of a long procession of flying
vehicles, going for the most part to Chalk Farm station, where the
North-Western special trains were loading up, instead of coming down
the gradient into Euston.

For a long time my brother stared out of the window in blank
astonishment, watching the policemen hammering at door after door, and
delivering their incomprehensible message. Then the door behind him
opened, and the man who lodged across the landing came in, dressed only
in shirt, trousers, and slippers, his braces loose about his waist, his
hair disordered from his pillow.

“What the devil is it?” he asked. “A fire? What a devil of a row!”

They both craned their heads out of the window, straining to hear what
the policemen were shouting. People were coming out of the side
streets, and standing in groups at the corners talking.

“What the devil is it all about?” said my brother’s fellow lodger.

My brother answered him vaguely and began to dress, running with each
garment to the window in order to miss nothing of the growing
excitement. And presently men selling unnaturally early newspapers came
bawling into the street:

“London in danger of suffocation! The Kingston and Richmond defences
forced! Fearful massacres in the Thames Valley!”

And all about him—in the rooms below, in the houses on each side and
across the road, and behind in the Park Terraces and in the hundred
other streets of that part of Marylebone, and the Westbourne Park
district and St. Pancras, and westward and northward in Kilburn and St.
John’s Wood and Hampstead, and eastward in Shoreditch and Highbury and
Haggerston and Hoxton, and, indeed, through all the vastness of London
from Ealing to East Ham—people were rubbing their eyes, and opening
windows to stare out and ask aimless questions, dressing hastily as the
first breath of the coming storm of Fear blew through the streets. It
was the dawn of the great panic. London, which had gone to bed on
Sunday night oblivious and inert, was awakened, in the small hours of
Monday morning, to a vivid sense of danger.

Unable from his window to learn what was happening, my brother went
down and out into the street, just as the sky between the parapets of
the houses grew pink with the early dawn. The flying people on foot and
in vehicles grew more numerous every moment. “Black Smoke!” he heard
people crying, and again “Black Smoke!” The contagion of such a
unanimous fear was inevitable. As my brother hesitated on the
door-step, he saw another newsvendor approaching, and got a paper
forthwith. The man was running away with the rest, and selling his
papers for a shilling each as he ran—a grotesque mingling of profit and
panic.

And from this paper my brother read that catastrophic dispatch of the
Commander-in-Chief:

“The Martians are able to discharge enormous clouds of a black and
poisonous vapour by means of rockets. They have smothered our
batteries, destroyed Richmond, Kingston, and Wimbledon, and are
advancing slowly towards London, destroying everything on the way. It
is impossible to stop them. There is no safety from the Black Smoke but
in instant flight.”


That was all, but it was enough. The whole population of the great
six-million city was stirring, slipping, running; presently it would be
pouring _en masse_ northward.

“Black Smoke!” the voices cried. “Fire!”

The bells of the neighbouring church made a jangling tumult, a cart
carelessly driven smashed, amid shrieks and curses, against the water
trough up the street. Sickly yellow lights went to and fro in the
houses, and some of the passing cabs flaunted unextinguished lamps. And
overhead the dawn was growing brighter, clear and steady and calm.

He heard footsteps running to and fro in the rooms, and up and down
stairs behind him. His landlady came to the door, loosely wrapped in
dressing gown and shawl; her husband followed, ejaculating.

As my brother began to realise the import of all these things, he
turned hastily to his own room, put all his available money—some ten
pounds altogether—into his pockets, and went out again into the
streets.




XV.
WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN SURREY.


It was while the curate had sat and talked so wildly to me under the
hedge in the flat meadows near Halliford, and while my brother was
watching the fugitives stream over Westminster Bridge, that the
Martians had resumed the offensive. So far as one can ascertain from
the conflicting accounts that have been put forth, the majority of them
remained busied with preparations in the Horsell pit until nine that
night, hurrying on some operation that disengaged huge volumes of green
smoke.

But three certainly came out about eight o’clock and, advancing slowly
and cautiously, made their way through Byfleet and Pyrford towards
Ripley and Weybridge, and so came in sight of the expectant batteries
against the setting sun. These Martians did not advance in a body, but
in a line, each perhaps a mile and a half from his nearest fellow. They
communicated with one another by means of sirenlike howls, running up
and down the scale from one note to another.

It was this howling and firing of the guns at Ripley and St. George’s
Hill that we had heard at Upper Halliford. The Ripley gunners,
unseasoned artillery volunteers who ought never to have been placed in
such a position, fired one wild, premature, ineffectual volley, and
bolted on horse and foot through the deserted village, while the
Martian, without using his Heat-Ray, walked serenely over their guns,
stepped gingerly among them, passed in front of them, and so came
unexpectedly upon the guns in Painshill Park, which he destroyed.

The St. George’s Hill men, however, were better led or of a better
mettle. Hidden by a pine wood as they were, they seem to have been
quite unsuspected by the Martian nearest to them. They laid their guns
as deliberately as if they had been on parade, and fired at about a
thousand yards’ range.

The shells flashed all round him, and he was seen to advance a few
paces, stagger, and go down. Everybody yelled together, and the guns
were reloaded in frantic haste. The overthrown Martian set up a
prolonged ululation, and immediately a second glittering giant,
answering him, appeared over the trees to the south. It would seem that
a leg of the tripod had been smashed by one of the shells. The whole of
the second volley flew wide of the Martian on the ground, and,
simultaneously, both his companions brought their Heat-Rays to bear on
the battery. The ammunition blew up, the pine trees all about the guns
flashed into fire, and only one or two of the men who were already
running over the crest of the hill escaped.

After this it would seem that the three took counsel together and
halted, and the scouts who were watching them report that they remained
absolutely stationary for the next half hour. The Martian who had been
overthrown crawled tediously out of his hood, a small brown figure,
oddly suggestive from that distance of a speck of blight, and
apparently engaged in the repair of his support. About nine he had
finished, for his cowl was then seen above the trees again.

It was a few minutes past nine that night when these three sentinels
were joined by four other Martians, each carrying a thick black tube. A
similar tube was handed to each of the three, and the seven proceeded
to distribute themselves at equal distances along a curved line between
St. George’s Hill, Weybridge, and the village of Send, southwest of
Ripley.

A dozen rockets sprang out of the hills before them so soon as they
began to move, and warned the waiting batteries about Ditton and Esher.
At the same time four of their fighting machines, similarly armed with
tubes, crossed the river, and two of them, black against the western
sky, came into sight of myself and the curate as we hurried wearily and
painfully along the road that runs northward out of Halliford. They
moved, as it seemed to us, upon a cloud, for a milky mist covered the
fields and rose to a third of their height.

At this sight the curate cried faintly in his throat, and began
running; but I knew it was no good running from a Martian, and I turned
aside and crawled through dewy nettles and brambles into the broad
ditch by the side of the road. He looked back, saw what I was doing,
and turned to join me.

The two halted, the nearer to us standing and facing Sunbury, the
remoter being a grey indistinctness towards the evening star, away
towards Staines.

The occasional howling of the Martians had ceased; they took up their
positions in the huge crescent about their cylinders in absolute
silence. It was a crescent with twelve miles between its horns. Never
since the devising of gunpowder was the beginning of a battle so still.
To us and to an observer about Ripley it would have had precisely the
same effect—the Martians seemed in solitary possession of the darkling
night, lit only as it was by the slender moon, the stars, the afterglow
of the daylight, and the ruddy glare from St. George’s Hill and the
woods of Painshill.

But facing that crescent everywhere—at Staines, Hounslow, Ditton,
Esher, Ockham, behind hills and woods south of the river, and across
the flat grass meadows to the north of it, wherever a cluster of trees
or village houses gave sufficient cover—the guns were waiting. The
signal rockets burst and rained their sparks through the night and
vanished, and the spirit of all those watching batteries rose to a
tense expectation. The Martians had but to advance into the line of
fire, and instantly those motionless black forms of men, those guns
glittering so darkly in the early night, would explode into a
thunderous fury of battle.

No doubt the thought that was uppermost in a thousand of those vigilant
minds, even as it was uppermost in mine, was the riddle—how much they
understood of us. Did they grasp that we in our millions were
organized, disciplined, working together? Or did they interpret our
spurts of fire, the sudden stinging of our shells, our steady
investment of their encampment, as we should the furious unanimity of
onslaught in a disturbed hive of bees? Did they dream they might
exterminate us? (At that time no one knew what food they needed.) A
hundred such questions struggled together in my mind as I watched that
vast sentinel shape. And in the back of my mind was the sense of all
the huge unknown and hidden forces Londonward. Had they prepared
pitfalls? Were the powder mills at Hounslow ready as a snare? Would the
Londoners have the heart and courage to make a greater Moscow of their
mighty province of houses?

Then, after an interminable time, as it seemed to us, crouching and
peering through the hedge, came a sound like the distant concussion of
a gun. Another nearer, and then another. And then the Martian beside us
raised his tube on high and discharged it, gunwise, with a heavy report
that made the ground heave. The one towards Staines answered him. There
was no flash, no smoke, simply that loaded detonation.

I was so excited by these heavy minute-guns following one another that
I so far forgot my personal safety and my scalded hands as to clamber
up into the hedge and stare towards Sunbury. As I did so a second
report followed, and a big projectile hurtled overhead towards
Hounslow. I expected at least to see smoke or fire, or some such
evidence of its work. But all I saw was the deep blue sky above, with
one solitary star, and the white mist spreading wide and low beneath.
And there had been no crash, no answering explosion. The silence was
restored; the minute lengthened to three.

“What has happened?” said the curate, standing up beside me.

“Heaven knows!” said I.

A bat flickered by and vanished. A distant tumult of shouting began and
ceased. I looked again at the Martian, and saw he was now moving
eastward along the riverbank, with a swift, rolling motion.

Every moment I expected the fire of some hidden battery to spring upon
him; but the evening calm was unbroken. The figure of the Martian grew
smaller as he receded, and presently the mist and the gathering night
had swallowed him up. By a common impulse we clambered higher. Towards
Sunbury was a dark appearance, as though a conical hill had suddenly
come into being there, hiding our view of the farther country; and
then, remoter across the river, over Walton, we saw another such
summit. These hill-like forms grew lower and broader even as we stared.

Moved by a sudden thought, I looked northward, and there I perceived a
third of these cloudy black kopjes had risen.

Everything had suddenly become very still. Far away to the southeast,
marking the quiet, we heard the Martians hooting to one another, and
then the air quivered again with the distant thud of their guns. But
the earthly artillery made no reply.

Now at the time we could not understand these things, but later I was
to learn the meaning of these ominous kopjes that gathered in the
twilight. Each of the Martians, standing in the great crescent I have
described, had discharged, by means of the gunlike tube he carried, a
huge canister over whatever hill, copse, cluster of houses, or other
possible cover for guns, chanced to be in front of him. Some fired only
one of these, some two—as in the case of the one we had seen; the one
at Ripley is said to have discharged no fewer than five at that time.
These canisters smashed on striking the ground—they did not explode—and
incontinently disengaged an enormous volume of heavy, inky vapour,
coiling and pouring upward in a huge and ebony cumulus cloud, a gaseous
hill that sank and spread itself slowly over the surrounding country.
And the touch of that vapour, the inhaling of its pungent wisps, was
death to all that breathes.

It was heavy, this vapour, heavier than the densest smoke, so that,
after the first tumultuous uprush and outflow of its impact, it sank
down through the air and poured over the ground in a manner rather
liquid than gaseous, abandoning the hills, and streaming into the
valleys and ditches and watercourses even as I have heard the
carbonic-acid gas that pours from volcanic clefts is wont to do. And
where it came upon water some chemical action occurred, and the surface
would be instantly covered with a powdery scum that sank slowly and
made way for more. The scum was absolutely insoluble, and it is a
strange thing, seeing the instant effect of the gas, that one could
drink without hurt the water from which it had been strained. The
vapour did not diffuse as a true gas would do. It hung together in
banks, flowing sluggishly down the slope of the land and driving
reluctantly before the wind, and very slowly it combined with the mist
and moisture of the air, and sank to the earth in the form of dust.
Save that an unknown element giving a group of four lines in the blue
of the spectrum is concerned, we are still entirely ignorant of the
nature of this substance.

Once the tumultuous upheaval of its dispersion was over, the black
smoke clung so closely to the ground, even before its precipitation,
that fifty feet up in the air, on the roofs and upper stories of high
houses and on great trees, there was a chance of escaping its poison
altogether, as was proved even that night at Street Cobham and Ditton.

The man who escaped at the former place tells a wonderful story of the
strangeness of its coiling flow, and how he looked down from the church
spire and saw the houses of the village rising like ghosts out of its
inky nothingness. For a day and a half he remained there, weary,
starving and sun-scorched, the earth under the blue sky and against the
prospect of the distant hills a velvet-black expanse, with red roofs,
green trees, and, later, black-veiled shrubs and gates, barns,
outhouses, and walls, rising here and there into the sunlight.

But that was at Street Cobham, where the black vapour was allowed to
remain until it sank of its own accord into the ground. As a rule the
Martians, when it had served its purpose, cleared the air of it again
by wading into it and directing a jet of steam upon it.

This they did with the vapour banks near us, as we saw in the starlight
from the window of a deserted house at Upper Halliford, whither we had
returned. From there we could see the searchlights on Richmond Hill and
Kingston Hill going to and fro, and about eleven the windows rattled,
and we heard the sound of the huge siege guns that had been put in
position there. These continued intermittently for the space of a
quarter of an hour, sending chance shots at the invisible Martians at
Hampton and Ditton, and then the pale beams of the electric light
vanished, and were replaced by a bright red glow.

Then the fourth cylinder fell—a brilliant green meteor—as I learned
afterwards, in Bushey Park. Before the guns on the Richmond and
Kingston line of hills began, there was a fitful cannonade far away in
the southwest, due, I believe, to guns being fired haphazard before the
black vapour could overwhelm the gunners.

So, setting about it as methodically as men might smoke out a wasps’
nest, the Martians spread this strange stifling vapour over the
Londonward country. The horns of the crescent slowly moved apart, until
at last they formed a line from Hanwell to Coombe and Malden. All night
through their destructive tubes advanced. Never once, after the Martian
at St. George’s Hill was brought down, did they give the artillery the
ghost of a chance against them. Wherever there was a possibility of
guns being laid for them unseen, a fresh canister of the black vapour
was discharged, and where the guns were openly displayed the Heat-Ray
was brought to bear.

By midnight the blazing trees along the slopes of Richmond Park and the
glare of Kingston Hill threw their light upon a network of black smoke,
blotting out the whole valley of the Thames and extending as far as the
eye could reach. And through this two Martians slowly waded, and turned
their hissing steam jets this way and that.

They were sparing of the Heat-Ray that night, either because they had
but a limited supply of material for its production or because they did
not wish to destroy the country but only to crush and overawe the
opposition they had aroused. In the latter aim they certainly
succeeded. Sunday night was the end of the organised opposition to
their movements. After that no body of men would stand against them, so
hopeless was the enterprise. Even the crews of the torpedo-boats and
destroyers that had brought their quick-firers up the Thames refused to
stop, mutinied, and went down again. The only offensive operation men
ventured upon after that night was the preparation of mines and
pitfalls, and even in that their energies were frantic and spasmodic.

One has to imagine, as well as one may, the fate of those batteries
towards Esher, waiting so tensely in the twilight. Survivors there were
none. One may picture the orderly expectation, the officers alert and
watchful, the gunners ready, the ammunition piled to hand, the limber
gunners with their horses and waggons, the groups of civilian
spectators standing as near as they were permitted, the evening
stillness, the ambulances and hospital tents with the burned and
wounded from Weybridge; then the dull resonance of the shots the
Martians fired, and the clumsy projectile whirling over the trees and
houses and smashing amid the neighbouring fields.

One may picture, too, the sudden shifting of the attention, the swiftly
spreading coils and bellyings of that blackness advancing headlong,
towering heavenward, turning the twilight to a palpable darkness, a
strange and horrible antagonist of vapour striding upon its victims,
men and horses near it seen dimly, running, shrieking, falling
headlong, shouts of dismay, the guns suddenly abandoned, men choking
and writhing on the ground, and the swift broadening-out of the opaque
cone of smoke. And then night and extinction—nothing but a silent mass
of impenetrable vapour hiding its dead.

Before dawn the black vapour was pouring through the streets of
Richmond, and the disintegrating organism of government was, with a
last expiring effort, rousing the population of London to the necessity
of flight.




XVI.
THE EXODUS FROM LONDON.


So you understand the roaring wave of fear that swept through the
greatest city in the world just as Monday was dawning—the stream of
flight rising swiftly to a torrent, lashing in a foaming tumult round
the railway stations, banked up into a horrible struggle about the
shipping in the Thames, and hurrying by every available channel
northward and eastward. By ten o’clock the police organisation, and by
midday even the railway organisations, were losing coherency, losing
shape and efficiency, guttering, softening, running at last in that
swift liquefaction of the social body.

All the railway lines north of the Thames and the South-Eastern people
at Cannon Street had been warned by midnight on Sunday, and trains were
being filled. People were fighting savagely for standing-room in the
carriages even at two o’clock. By three, people were being trampled and
crushed even in Bishopsgate Street, a couple of hundred yards or more
from Liverpool Street station; revolvers were fired, people stabbed,
and the policemen who had been sent to direct the traffic, exhausted
and infuriated, were breaking the heads of the people they were called
out to protect.

And as the day advanced and the engine drivers and stokers refused to
return to London, the pressure of the flight drove the people in an
ever-thickening multitude away from the stations and along the
northward-running roads. By midday a Martian had been seen at Barnes,
and a cloud of slowly sinking black vapour drove along the Thames and
across the flats of Lambeth, cutting off all escape over the bridges in
its sluggish advance. Another bank drove over Ealing, and surrounded a
little island of survivors on Castle Hill, alive, but unable to escape.

After a fruitless struggle to get aboard a North-Western train at Chalk
Farm—the engines of the trains that had loaded in the goods yard there
_ploughed_ through shrieking people, and a dozen stalwart men fought to
keep the crowd from crushing the driver against his furnace—my brother
emerged upon the Chalk Farm road, dodged across through a hurrying
swarm of vehicles, and had the luck to be foremost in the sack of a
cycle shop. The front tire of the machine he got was punctured in
dragging it through the window, but he got up and off, notwithstanding,
with no further injury than a cut wrist. The steep foot of Haverstock
Hill was impassable owing to several overturned horses, and my brother
struck into Belsize Road.

So he got out of the fury of the panic, and, skirting the Edgware Road,
reached Edgware about seven, fasting and wearied, but well ahead of the
crowd. Along the road people were standing in the roadway, curious,
wondering. He was passed by a number of cyclists, some horsemen, and
two motor cars. A mile from Edgware the rim of the wheel broke, and the
machine became unridable. He left it by the roadside and trudged
through the village. There were shops half opened in the main street of
the place, and people crowded on the pavement and in the doorways and
windows, staring astonished at this extraordinary procession of
fugitives that was beginning. He succeeded in getting some food at an
inn.

For a time he remained in Edgware not knowing what next to do. The
flying people increased in number. Many of them, like my brother,
seemed inclined to loiter in the place. There was no fresh news of the
invaders from Mars.

At that time the road was crowded, but as yet far from congested. Most
of the fugitives at that hour were mounted on cycles, but there were
soon motor cars, hansom cabs, and carriages hurrying along, and the
dust hung in heavy clouds along the road to St. Albans.

It was perhaps a vague idea of making his way to Chelmsford, where some
friends of his lived, that at last induced my brother to strike into a
quiet lane running eastward. Presently he came upon a stile, and,
crossing it, followed a footpath northeastward. He passed near several
farmhouses and some little places whose names he did not learn. He saw
few fugitives until, in a grass lane towards High Barnet, he happened
upon two ladies who became his fellow travellers. He came upon them
just in time to save them.

He heard their screams, and, hurrying round the corner, saw a couple of
men struggling to drag them out of the little pony-chaise in which they
had been driving, while a third with difficulty held the frightened
pony’s head. One of the ladies, a short woman dressed in white, was
simply screaming; the other, a dark, slender figure, slashed at the man
who gripped her arm with a whip she held in her disengaged hand.

My brother immediately grasped the situation, shouted, and hurried
towards the struggle. One of the men desisted and turned towards him,
and my brother, realising from his antagonist’s face that a fight was
unavoidable, and being an expert boxer, went into him forthwith and
sent him down against the wheel of the chaise.

It was no time for pugilistic chivalry and my brother laid him quiet
with a kick, and gripped the collar of the man who pulled at the
slender lady’s arm. He heard the clatter of hoofs, the whip stung
across his face, a third antagonist struck him between the eyes, and
the man he held wrenched himself free and made off down the lane in the
direction from which he had come.

Partly stunned, he found himself facing the man who had held the
horse’s head, and became aware of the chaise receding from him down the
lane, swaying from side to side, and with the women in it looking back.
The man before him, a burly rough, tried to close, and he stopped him
with a blow in the face. Then, realising that he was deserted, he
dodged round and made off down the lane after the chaise, with the
sturdy man close behind him, and the fugitive, who had turned now,
following remotely.

Suddenly he stumbled and fell; his immediate pursuer went headlong, and
he rose to his feet to find himself with a couple of antagonists again.
He would have had little chance against them had not the slender lady
very pluckily pulled up and returned to his help. It seems she had had
a revolver all this time, but it had been under the seat when she and
her companion were attacked. She fired at six yards’ distance, narrowly
missing my brother. The less courageous of the robbers made off, and
his companion followed him, cursing his cowardice. They both stopped in
sight down the lane, where the third man lay insensible.

“Take this!” said the slender lady, and she gave my brother her
revolver.

“Go back to the chaise,” said my brother, wiping the blood from his
split lip.

She turned without a word—they were both panting—and they went back to
where the lady in white struggled to hold back the frightened pony.

The robbers had evidently had enough of it. When my brother looked
again they were retreating.

“I’ll sit here,” said my brother, “if I may”; and he got upon the empty
front seat. The lady looked over her shoulder.

“Give me the reins,” she said, and laid the whip along the pony’s side.
In another moment a bend in the road hid the three men from my
brother’s eyes.

So, quite unexpectedly, my brother found himself, panting, with a cut
mouth, a bruised jaw, and bloodstained knuckles, driving along an
unknown lane with these two women.

He learned they were the wife and the younger sister of a surgeon
living at Stanmore, who had come in the small hours from a dangerous
case at Pinner, and heard at some railway station on his way of the
Martian advance. He had hurried home, roused the women—their servant
had left them two days before—packed some provisions, put his revolver
under the seat—luckily for my brother—and told them to drive on to
Edgware, with the idea of getting a train there. He stopped behind to
tell the neighbours. He would overtake them, he said, at about half
past four in the morning, and now it was nearly nine and they had seen
nothing of him. They could not stop in Edgware because of the growing
traffic through the place, and so they had come into this side lane.

That was the story they told my brother in fragments when presently
they stopped again, nearer to New Barnet. He promised to stay with
them, at least until they could determine what to do, or until the
missing man arrived, and professed to be an expert shot with the
revolver—a weapon strange to him—in order to give them confidence.

They made a sort of encampment by the wayside, and the pony became
happy in the hedge. He told them of his own escape out of London, and
all that he knew of these Martians and their ways. The sun crept higher
in the sky, and after a time their talk died out and gave place to an
uneasy state of anticipation. Several wayfarers came along the lane,
and of these my brother gathered such news as he could. Every broken
answer he had deepened his impression of the great disaster that had
come on humanity, deepened his persuasion of the immediate necessity
for prosecuting this flight. He urged the matter upon them.

“We have money,” said the slender woman, and hesitated.

Her eyes met my brother’s, and her hesitation ended.

“So have I,” said my brother.

She explained that they had as much as thirty pounds in gold, besides a
five-pound note, and suggested that with that they might get upon a
train at St. Albans or New Barnet. My brother thought that was
hopeless, seeing the fury of the Londoners to crowd upon the trains,
and broached his own idea of striking across Essex towards Harwich and
thence escaping from the country altogether.

Mrs. Elphinstone—that was the name of the woman in white—would listen
to no reasoning, and kept calling upon “George”; but her sister-in-law
was astonishingly quiet and deliberate, and at last agreed to my
brother’s suggestion. So, designing to cross the Great North Road, they
went on towards Barnet, my brother leading the pony to save it as much
as possible. As the sun crept up the sky the day became excessively
hot, and under foot a thick, whitish sand grew burning and blinding, so
that they travelled only very slowly. The hedges were grey with dust.
And as they advanced towards Barnet a tumultuous murmuring grew
stronger.

They began to meet more people. For the most part these were staring
before them, murmuring indistinct questions, jaded, haggard, unclean.
One man in evening dress passed them on foot, his eyes on the ground.
They heard his voice, and, looking back at him, saw one hand clutched
in his hair and the other beating invisible things. His paroxysm of
rage over, he went on his way without once looking back.

As my brother’s party went on towards the crossroads to the south of
Barnet they saw a woman approaching the road across some fields on
their left, carrying a child and with two other children; and then
passed a man in dirty black, with a thick stick in one hand and a small
portmanteau in the other. Then round the corner of the lane, from
between the villas that guarded it at its confluence with the high
road, came a little cart drawn by a sweating black pony and driven by a
sallow youth in a bowler hat, grey with dust. There were three girls,
East End factory girls, and a couple of little children crowded in the
cart.

“This’ll tike us rahnd Edgware?” asked the driver, wild-eyed,
white-faced; and when my brother told him it would if he turned to the
left, he whipped up at once without the formality of thanks.

My brother noticed a pale grey smoke or haze rising among the houses in
front of them, and veiling the white façade of a terrace beyond the
road that appeared between the backs of the villas. Mrs. Elphinstone
suddenly cried out at a number of tongues of smoky red flame leaping up
above the houses in front of them against the hot, blue sky. The
tumultuous noise resolved itself now into the disorderly mingling of
many voices, the gride of many wheels, the creaking of waggons, and the
staccato of hoofs. The lane came round sharply not fifty yards from the
crossroads.

“Good heavens!” cried Mrs. Elphinstone. “What is this you are driving
us into?”

My brother stopped.

For the main road was a boiling stream of people, a torrent of human
beings rushing northward, one pressing on another. A great bank of
dust, white and luminous in the blaze of the sun, made everything
within twenty feet of the ground grey and indistinct and was
perpetually renewed by the hurrying feet of a dense crowd of horses and
of men and women on foot, and by the wheels of vehicles of every
description.

“Way!” my brother heard voices crying. “Make way!”

It was like riding into the smoke of a fire to approach the meeting
point of the lane and road; the crowd roared like a fire, and the dust
was hot and pungent. And, indeed, a little way up the road a villa was
burning and sending rolling masses of black smoke across the road to
add to the confusion.

Two men came past them. Then a dirty woman, carrying a heavy bundle and
weeping. A lost retriever dog, with hanging tongue, circled dubiously
round them, scared and wretched, and fled at my brother’s threat.

So much as they could see of the road Londonward between the houses to
the right was a tumultuous stream of dirty, hurrying people, pent in
between the villas on either side; the black heads, the crowded forms,
grew into distinctness as they rushed towards the corner, hurried past,
and merged their individuality again in a receding multitude that was
swallowed up at last in a cloud of dust.

“Go on! Go on!” cried the voices. “Way! Way!”

One man’s hands pressed on the back of another. My brother stood at the
pony’s head. Irresistibly attracted, he advanced slowly, pace by pace,
down the lane.

Edgware had been a scene of confusion, Chalk Farm a riotous tumult, but
this was a whole population in movement. It is hard to imagine that
host. It had no character of its own. The figures poured out past the
corner, and receded with their backs to the group in the lane. Along
the margin came those who were on foot threatened by the wheels,
stumbling in the ditches, blundering into one another.

The carts and carriages crowded close upon one another, making little
way for those swifter and more impatient vehicles that darted forward
every now and then when an opportunity showed itself of doing so,
sending the people scattering against the fences and gates of the
villas.

“Push on!” was the cry. “Push on! They are coming!”

In one cart stood a blind man in the uniform of the Salvation Army,
gesticulating with his crooked fingers and bawling, “Eternity!
Eternity!” His voice was hoarse and very loud so that my brother could
hear him long after he was lost to sight in the dust. Some of the
people who crowded in the carts whipped stupidly at their horses and
quarrelled with other drivers; some sat motionless, staring at nothing
with miserable eyes; some gnawed their hands with thirst, or lay
prostrate in the bottoms of their conveyances. The horses’ bits were
covered with foam, their eyes bloodshot.

There were cabs, carriages, shop-carts, waggons, beyond counting; a
mail cart, a road-cleaner’s cart marked “Vestry of St. Pancras,” a huge
timber waggon crowded with roughs. A brewer’s dray rumbled by with its
two near wheels splashed with fresh blood.

“Clear the way!” cried the voices. “Clear the way!”

“Eter-nity! Eter-nity!” came echoing down the road.

There were sad, haggard women tramping by, well dressed, with children
that cried and stumbled, their dainty clothes smothered in dust, their
weary faces smeared with tears. With many of these came men, sometimes
helpful, sometimes lowering and savage. Fighting side by side with them
pushed some weary street outcast in faded black rags, wide-eyed,
loud-voiced, and foul-mouthed. There were sturdy workmen thrusting
their way along, wretched, unkempt men, clothed like clerks or shopmen,
struggling spasmodically; a wounded soldier my brother noticed, men
dressed in the clothes of railway porters, one wretched creature in a
nightshirt with a coat thrown over it.

But varied as its composition was, certain things all that host had in
common. There were fear and pain on their faces, and fear behind them.
A tumult up the road, a quarrel for a place in a waggon, sent the whole
host of them quickening their pace; even a man so scared and broken
that his knees bent under him was galvanised for a moment into renewed
activity. The heat and dust had already been at work upon this
multitude. Their skins were dry, their lips black and cracked. They
were all thirsty, weary, and footsore. And amid the various cries one
heard disputes, reproaches, groans of weariness and fatigue; the voices
of most of them were hoarse and weak. Through it all ran a refrain:

“Way! Way! The Martians are coming!”

Few stopped and came aside from that flood. The lane opened slantingly
into the main road with a narrow opening, and had a delusive appearance
of coming from the direction of London. Yet a kind of eddy of people
drove into its mouth; weaklings elbowed out of the stream, who for the
most part rested but a moment before plunging into it again. A little
way down the lane, with two friends bending over him, lay a man with a
bare leg, wrapped about with bloody rags. He was a lucky man to have
friends.

A little old man, with a grey military moustache and a filthy black
frock coat, limped out and sat down beside the trap, removed his
boot—his sock was blood-stained—shook out a pebble, and hobbled on
again; and then a little girl of eight or nine, all alone, threw
herself under the hedge close by my brother, weeping.

“I can’t go on! I can’t go on!”

My brother woke from his torpor of astonishment and lifted her up,
speaking gently to her, and carried her to Miss Elphinstone. So soon as
my brother touched her she became quite still, as if frightened.

“Ellen!” shrieked a woman in the crowd, with tears in her
voice—“Ellen!” And the child suddenly darted away from my brother,
crying “Mother!”

“They are coming,” said a man on horseback, riding past along the lane.

“Out of the way, there!” bawled a coachman, towering high; and my
brother saw a closed carriage turning into the lane.

The people crushed back on one another to avoid the horse. My brother
pushed the pony and chaise back into the hedge, and the man drove by
and stopped at the turn of the way. It was a carriage, with a pole for
a pair of horses, but only one was in the traces. My brother saw dimly
through the dust that two men lifted out something on a white stretcher
and put it gently on the grass beneath the privet hedge.

One of the men came running to my brother.

“Where is there any water?” he said. “He is dying fast, and very
thirsty. It is Lord Garrick.”

“Lord Garrick!” said my brother; “the Chief Justice?”

“The water?” he said.

“There may be a tap,” said my brother, “in some of the houses. We have
no water. I dare not leave my people.”

The man pushed against the crowd towards the gate of the corner house.

“Go on!” said the people, thrusting at him. “They are coming! Go on!”

Then my brother’s attention was distracted by a bearded, eagle-faced
man lugging a small handbag, which split even as my brother’s eyes
rested on it and disgorged a mass of sovereigns that seemed to break up
into separate coins as it struck the ground. They rolled hither and
thither among the struggling feet of men and horses. The man stopped
and looked stupidly at the heap, and the shaft of a cab struck his
shoulder and sent him reeling. He gave a shriek and dodged back, and a
cartwheel shaved him narrowly.

“Way!” cried the men all about him. “Make way!”

So soon as the cab had passed, he flung himself, with both hands open,
upon the heap of coins, and began thrusting handfuls in his pocket. A
horse rose close upon him, and in another moment, half rising, he had
been borne down under the horse’s hoofs.

“Stop!” screamed my brother, and pushing a woman out of his way, tried
to clutch the bit of the horse.

Before he could get to it, he heard a scream under the wheels, and saw
through the dust the rim passing over the poor wretch’s back. The
driver of the cart slashed his whip at my brother, who ran round behind
the cart. The multitudinous shouting confused his ears. The man was
writhing in the dust among his scattered money, unable to rise, for the
wheel had broken his back, and his lower limbs lay limp and dead. My
brother stood up and yelled at the next driver, and a man on a black
horse came to his assistance.

“Get him out of the road,” said he; and, clutching the man’s collar
with his free hand, my brother lugged him sideways. But he still
clutched after his money, and regarded my brother fiercely, hammering
at his arm with a handful of gold. “Go on! Go on!” shouted angry voices
behind. “Way! Way!”

There was a smash as the pole of a carriage crashed into the cart that
the man on horseback stopped. My brother looked up, and the man with
the gold twisted his head round and bit the wrist that held his collar.
There was a concussion, and the black horse came staggering sideways,
and the carthorse pushed beside it. A hoof missed my brother’s foot by
a hair’s breadth. He released his grip on the fallen man and jumped
back. He saw anger change to terror on the face of the poor wretch on
the ground, and in a moment he was hidden and my brother was borne
backward and carried past the entrance of the lane, and had to fight
hard in the torrent to recover it.

He saw Miss Elphinstone covering her eyes, and a little child, with all
a child’s want of sympathetic imagination, staring with dilated eyes at
a dusty something that lay black and still, ground and crushed under
the rolling wheels. “Let us go back!” he shouted, and began turning the
pony round. “We cannot cross this—hell,” he said and they went back a
hundred yards the way they had come, until the fighting crowd was
hidden. As they passed the bend in the lane my brother saw the face of
the dying man in the ditch under the privet, deadly white and drawn,
and shining with perspiration. The two women sat silent, crouching in
their seat and shivering.

Then beyond the bend my brother stopped again. Miss Elphinstone was
white and pale, and her sister-in-law sat weeping, too wretched even to
call upon “George.” My brother was horrified and perplexed. So soon as
they had retreated he realised how urgent and unavoidable it was to
attempt this crossing. He turned to Miss Elphinstone, suddenly
resolute.

“We must go that way,” he said, and led the pony round again.

For the second time that day this girl proved her quality. To force
their way into the torrent of people, my brother plunged into the
traffic and held back a cab horse, while she drove the pony across its
head. A waggon locked wheels for a moment and ripped a long splinter
from the chaise. In another moment they were caught and swept forward
by the stream. My brother, with the cabman’s whip marks red across his
face and hands, scrambled into the chaise and took the reins from her.

“Point the revolver at the man behind,” he said, giving it to her, “if
he presses us too hard. No!—point it at his horse.”

Then he began to look out for a chance of edging to the right across
the road. But once in the stream he seemed to lose volition, to become
a part of that dusty rout. They swept through Chipping Barnet with the
torrent; they were nearly a mile beyond the centre of the town before
they had fought across to the opposite side of the way. It was din and
confusion indescribable; but in and beyond the town the road forks
repeatedly, and this to some extent relieved the stress.

They struck eastward through Hadley, and there on either side of the
road, and at another place farther on they came upon a great multitude
of people drinking at the stream, some fighting to come at the water.
And farther on, from a lull near East Barnet, they saw two trains
running slowly one after the other without signal or order—trains
swarming with people, with men even among the coals behind the
engines—going northward along the Great Northern Railway. My brother
supposes they must have filled outside London, for at that time the
furious terror of the people had rendered the central termini
impossible.

Near this place they halted for the rest of the afternoon, for the
violence of the day had already utterly exhausted all three of them.
They began to suffer the beginnings of hunger; the night was cold, and
none of them dared to sleep. And in the evening many people came
hurrying along the road nearby their stopping place, fleeing from
unknown dangers before them, and going in the direction from which my
brother had come.




XVII.
THE “THUNDER CHILD”.


Had the Martians aimed only at destruction, they might on Monday have
annihilated the entire population of London, as it spread itself slowly
through the home counties. Not only along the road through Barnet, but
also through Edgware and Waltham Abbey, and along the roads eastward to
Southend and Shoeburyness, and south of the Thames to Deal and
Broadstairs, poured the same frantic rout. If one could have hung that
June morning in a balloon in the blazing blue above London every
northward and eastward road running out of the tangled maze of streets
would have seemed stippled black with the streaming fugitives, each dot
a human agony of terror and physical distress. I have set forth at
length in the last chapter my brother’s account of the road through
Chipping Barnet, in order that my readers may realise how that swarming
of black dots appeared to one of those concerned. Never before in the
history of the world had such a mass of human beings moved and suffered
together. The legendary hosts of Goths and Huns, the hugest armies Asia
has ever seen, would have been but a drop in that current. And this was
no disciplined march; it was a stampede—a stampede gigantic and
terrible—without order and without a goal, six million people unarmed
and unprovisioned, driving headlong. It was the beginning of the rout
of civilisation, of the massacre of mankind.

Directly below him the balloonist would have seen the network of
streets far and wide, houses, churches, squares, crescents,
gardens—already derelict—spread out like a huge map, and in the
southward _blotted_. Over Ealing, Richmond, Wimbledon, it would have
seemed as if some monstrous pen had flung ink upon the chart. Steadily,
incessantly, each black splash grew and spread, shooting out
ramifications this way and that, now banking itself against rising
ground, now pouring swiftly over a crest into a new-found valley,
exactly as a gout of ink would spread itself upon blotting paper.

And beyond, over the blue hills that rise southward of the river, the
glittering Martians went to and fro, calmly and methodically spreading
their poison cloud over this patch of country and then over that,
laying it again with their steam jets when it had served its purpose,
and taking possession of the conquered country. They do not seem to
have aimed at extermination so much as at complete demoralisation and
the destruction of any opposition. They exploded any stores of powder
they came upon, cut every telegraph, and wrecked the railways here and
there. They were hamstringing mankind. They seemed in no hurry to
extend the field of their operations, and did not come beyond the
central part of London all that day. It is possible that a very
considerable number of people in London stuck to their houses through
Monday morning. Certain it is that many died at home suffocated by the
Black Smoke.

Until about midday the Pool of London was an astonishing scene.
Steamboats and shipping of all sorts lay there, tempted by the enormous
sums of money offered by fugitives, and it is said that many who swam
out to these vessels were thrust off with boathooks and drowned. About
one o’clock in the afternoon the thinning remnant of a cloud of the
black vapour appeared between the arches of Blackfriars Bridge. At that
the Pool became a scene of mad confusion, fighting, and collision, and
for some time a multitude of boats and barges jammed in the northern
arch of the Tower Bridge, and the sailors and lightermen had to fight
savagely against the people who swarmed upon them from the riverfront.
People were actually clambering down the piers of the bridge from
above.

When, an hour later, a Martian appeared beyond the Clock Tower and
waded down the river, nothing but wreckage floated above Limehouse.

Of the falling of the fifth cylinder I have presently to tell. The
sixth star fell at Wimbledon. My brother, keeping watch beside the
women in the chaise in a meadow, saw the green flash of it far beyond
the hills. On Tuesday the little party, still set upon getting across
the sea, made its way through the swarming country towards Colchester.
The news that the Martians were now in possession of the whole of
London was confirmed. They had been seen at Highgate, and even, it was
said, at Neasden. But they did not come into my brother’s view until
the morrow.

That day the scattered multitudes began to realise the urgent need of
provisions. As they grew hungry the rights of property ceased to be
regarded. Farmers were out to defend their cattle-sheds, granaries, and
ripening root crops with arms in their hands. A number of people now,
like my brother, had their faces eastward, and there were some
desperate souls even going back towards London to get food. These were
chiefly people from the northern suburbs, whose knowledge of the Black
Smoke came by hearsay. He heard that about half the members of the
government had gathered at Birmingham, and that enormous quantities of
high explosives were being prepared to be used in automatic mines
across the Midland counties.

He was also told that the Midland Railway Company had replaced the
desertions of the first day’s panic, had resumed traffic, and was
running northward trains from St. Albans to relieve the congestion of
the home counties. There was also a placard in Chipping Ongar
announcing that large stores of flour were available in the northern
towns and that within twenty-four hours bread would be distributed
among the starving people in the neighbourhood. But this intelligence
did not deter him from the plan of escape he had formed, and the three
pressed eastward all day, and heard no more of the bread distribution
than this promise. Nor, as a matter of fact, did anyone else hear more
of it. That night fell the seventh star, falling upon Primrose Hill. It
fell while Miss Elphinstone was watching, for she took that duty
alternately with my brother. She saw it.

On Wednesday the three fugitives—they had passed the night in a field
of unripe wheat—reached Chelmsford, and there a body of the
inhabitants, calling itself the Committee of Public Supply, seized the
pony as provisions, and would give nothing in exchange for it but the
promise of a share in it the next day. Here there were rumours of
Martians at Epping, and news of the destruction of Waltham Abbey Powder
Mills in a vain attempt to blow up one of the invaders.

People were watching for Martians here from the church towers. My
brother, very luckily for him as it chanced, preferred to push on at
once to the coast rather than wait for food, although all three of them
were very hungry. By midday they passed through Tillingham, which,
strangely enough, seemed to be quite silent and deserted, save for a
few furtive plunderers hunting for food. Near Tillingham they suddenly
came in sight of the sea, and the most amazing crowd of shipping of all
sorts that it is possible to imagine.

For after the sailors could no longer come up the Thames, they came on
to the Essex coast, to Harwich and Walton and Clacton, and afterwards
to Foulness and Shoebury, to bring off the people. They lay in a huge
sickle-shaped curve that vanished into mist at last towards the Naze.
Close inshore was a multitude of fishing smacks—English, Scotch,
French, Dutch, and Swedish; steam launches from the Thames, yachts,
electric boats; and beyond were ships of larger burden, a multitude of
filthy colliers, trim merchantmen, cattle ships, passenger boats,
petroleum tanks, ocean tramps, an old white transport even, neat white
and grey liners from Southampton and Hamburg; and along the blue coast
across the Blackwater my brother could make out dimly a dense swarm of
boats chaffering with the people on the beach, a swarm which also
extended up the Blackwater almost to Maldon.

About a couple of miles out lay an ironclad, very low in the water,
almost, to my brother’s perception, like a water-logged ship. This was
the ram _Thunder Child_. It was the only warship in sight, but far away
to the right over the smooth surface of the sea—for that day there was
a dead calm—lay a serpent of black smoke to mark the next ironclads of
the Channel Fleet, which hovered in an extended line, steam up and
ready for action, across the Thames estuary during the course of the
Martian conquest, vigilant and yet powerless to prevent it.

At the sight of the sea, Mrs. Elphinstone, in spite of the assurances
of her sister-in-law, gave way to panic. She had never been out of
England before, she would rather die than trust herself friendless in a
foreign country, and so forth. She seemed, poor woman, to imagine that
the French and the Martians might prove very similar. She had been
growing increasingly hysterical, fearful, and depressed during the two
days’ journeyings. Her great idea was to return to Stanmore. Things had
been always well and safe at Stanmore. They would find George at
Stanmore....

It was with the greatest difficulty they could get her down to the
beach, where presently my brother succeeded in attracting the attention
of some men on a paddle steamer from the Thames. They sent a boat and
drove a bargain for thirty-six pounds for the three. The steamer was
going, these men said, to Ostend.

It was about two o’clock when my brother, having paid their fares at
the gangway, found himself safely aboard the steamboat with his
charges. There was food aboard, albeit at exorbitant prices, and the
three of them contrived to eat a meal on one of the seats forward.

There were already a couple of score of passengers aboard, some of whom
had expended their last money in securing a passage, but the captain
lay off the Blackwater until five in the afternoon, picking up
passengers until the seated decks were even dangerously crowded. He
would probably have remained longer had it not been for the sound of
guns that began about that hour in the south. As if in answer, the
ironclad seaward fired a small gun and hoisted a string of flags. A jet
of smoke sprang out of her funnels.

Some of the passengers were of opinion that this firing came from
Shoeburyness, until it was noticed that it was growing louder. At the
same time, far away in the southeast the masts and upperworks of three
ironclads rose one after the other out of the sea, beneath clouds of
black smoke. But my brother’s attention speedily reverted to the
distant firing in the south. He fancied he saw a column of smoke rising
out of the distant grey haze.

The little steamer was already flapping her way eastward of the big
crescent of shipping, and the low Essex coast was growing blue and
hazy, when a Martian appeared, small and faint in the remote distance,
advancing along the muddy coast from the direction of Foulness. At that
the captain on the bridge swore at the top of his voice with fear and
anger at his own delay, and the paddles seemed infected with his
terror. Every soul aboard stood at the bulwarks or on the seats of the
steamer and stared at that distant shape, higher than the trees or
church towers inland, and advancing with a leisurely parody of a human
stride.

It was the first Martian my brother had seen, and he stood, more amazed
than terrified, watching this Titan advancing deliberately towards the
shipping, wading farther and farther into the water as the coast fell
away. Then, far away beyond the Crouch, came another, striding over
some stunted trees, and then yet another, still farther off, wading
deeply through a shiny mudflat that seemed to hang halfway up between
sea and sky. They were all stalking seaward, as if to intercept the
escape of the multitudinous vessels that were crowded between Foulness
and the Naze. In spite of the throbbing exertions of the engines of the
little paddle-boat, and the pouring foam that her wheels flung behind
her, she receded with terrifying slowness from this ominous advance.

Glancing northwestward, my brother saw the large crescent of shipping
already writhing with the approaching terror; one ship passing behind
another, another coming round from broadside to end on, steamships
whistling and giving off volumes of steam, sails being let out,
launches rushing hither and thither. He was so fascinated by this and
by the creeping danger away to the left that he had no eyes for
anything seaward. And then a swift movement of the steamboat (she had
suddenly come round to avoid being run down) flung him headlong from
the seat upon which he was standing. There was a shouting all about
him, a trampling of feet, and a cheer that seemed to be answered
faintly. The steamboat lurched and rolled him over upon his hands.

He sprang to his feet and saw to starboard, and not a hundred yards
from their heeling, pitching boat, a vast iron bulk like the blade of a
plough tearing through the water, tossing it on either side in huge
waves of foam that leaped towards the steamer, flinging her paddles
helplessly in the air, and then sucking her deck down almost to the
waterline.

A douche of spray blinded my brother for a moment. When his eyes were
clear again he saw the monster had passed and was rushing landward. Big
iron upperworks rose out of this headlong structure, and from that twin
funnels projected and spat a smoking blast shot with fire. It was the
torpedo ram, _Thunder Child_, steaming headlong, coming to the rescue
of the threatened shipping.

Keeping his footing on the heaving deck by clutching the bulwarks, my
brother looked past this charging leviathan at the Martians again, and
he saw the three of them now close together, and standing so far out to
sea that their tripod supports were almost entirely submerged. Thus
sunken, and seen in remote perspective, they appeared far less
formidable than the huge iron bulk in whose wake the steamer was
pitching so helplessly. It would seem they were regarding this new
antagonist with astonishment. To their intelligence, it may be, the
giant was even such another as themselves. The _Thunder Child_ fired no
gun, but simply drove full speed towards them. It was probably her not
firing that enabled her to get so near the enemy as she did. They did
not know what to make of her. One shell, and they would have sent her
to the bottom forthwith with the Heat-Ray.

She was steaming at such a pace that in a minute she seemed halfway
between the steamboat and the Martians—a diminishing black bulk against
the receding horizontal expanse of the Essex coast.

Suddenly the foremost Martian lowered his tube and discharged a
canister of the black gas at the ironclad. It hit her larboard side and
glanced off in an inky jet that rolled away to seaward, an unfolding
torrent of Black Smoke, from which the ironclad drove clear. To the
watchers from the steamer, low in the water and with the sun in their
eyes, it seemed as though she were already among the Martians.

They saw the gaunt figures separating and rising out of the water as
they retreated shoreward, and one of them raised the camera-like
generator of the Heat-Ray. He held it pointing obliquely downward, and
a bank of steam sprang from the water at its touch. It must have driven
through the iron of the ship’s side like a white-hot iron rod through
paper.

A flicker of flame went up through the rising steam, and then the
Martian reeled and staggered. In another moment he was cut down, and a
great body of water and steam shot high in the air. The guns of the
_Thunder Child_ sounded through the reek, going off one after the
other, and one shot splashed the water high close by the steamer,
ricocheted towards the other flying ships to the north, and smashed a
smack to matchwood.

But no one heeded that very much. At the sight of the Martian’s
collapse the captain on the bridge yelled inarticulately, and all the
crowding passengers on the steamer’s stern shouted together. And then
they yelled again. For, surging out beyond the white tumult, drove
something long and black, the flames streaming from its middle parts,
its ventilators and funnels spouting fire.

She was alive still; the steering gear, it seems, was intact and her
engines working. She headed straight for a second Martian, and was
within a hundred yards of him when the Heat-Ray came to bear. Then with
a violent thud, a blinding flash, her decks, her funnels, leaped
upward. The Martian staggered with the violence of her explosion, and
in another moment the flaming wreckage, still driving forward with the
impetus of its pace, had struck him and crumpled him up like a thing of
cardboard. My brother shouted involuntarily. A boiling tumult of steam
hid everything again.

“Two!” yelled the captain.

Everyone was shouting. The whole steamer from end to end rang with
frantic cheering that was taken up first by one and then by all in the
crowding multitude of ships and boats that was driving out to sea.

The steam hung upon the water for many minutes, hiding the third
Martian and the coast altogether. And all this time the boat was
paddling steadily out to sea and away from the fight; and when at last
the confusion cleared, the drifting bank of black vapour intervened,
and nothing of the _Thunder Child_ could be made out, nor could the
third Martian be seen. But the ironclads to seaward were now quite
close and standing in towards shore past the steamboat.

The little vessel continued to beat its way seaward, and the ironclads
receded slowly towards the coast, which was hidden still by a marbled
bank of vapour, part steam, part black gas, eddying and combining in
the strangest way. The fleet of refugees was scattering to the
northeast; several smacks were sailing between the ironclads and the
steamboat. After a time, and before they reached the sinking cloud
bank, the warships turned northward, and then abruptly went about and
passed into the thickening haze of evening southward. The coast grew
faint, and at last indistinguishable amid the low banks of clouds that
were gathering about the sinking sun.

Then suddenly out of the golden haze of the sunset came the vibration
of guns, and a form of black shadows moving. Everyone struggled to the
rail of the steamer and peered into the blinding furnace of the west,
but nothing was to be distinguished clearly. A mass of smoke rose
slanting and barred the face of the sun. The steamboat throbbed on its
way through an interminable suspense.

The sun sank into grey clouds, the sky flushed and darkened, the
evening star trembled into sight. It was deep twilight when the captain
cried out and pointed. My brother strained his eyes. Something rushed
up into the sky out of the greyness—rushed slantingly upward and very
swiftly into the luminous clearness above the clouds in the western
sky; something flat and broad, and very large, that swept round in a
vast curve, grew smaller, sank slowly, and vanished again into the grey
mystery of the night. And as it flew it rained down darkness upon the
land.




BOOK TWO
THE EARTH UNDER THE MARTIANS.




I.
UNDER FOOT.


In the first book I have wandered so much from my own adventures to
tell of the experiences of my brother that all through the last two
chapters I and the curate have been lurking in the empty house at
Halliford whither we fled to escape the Black Smoke. There I will
resume. We stopped there all Sunday night and all the next day—the day
of the panic—in a little island of daylight, cut off by the Black Smoke
from the rest of the world. We could do nothing but wait in aching
inactivity during those two weary days.

My mind was occupied by anxiety for my wife. I figured her at
Leatherhead, terrified, in danger, mourning me already as a dead man. I
paced the rooms and cried aloud when I thought of how I was cut off
from her, of all that might happen to her in my absence. My cousin I
knew was brave enough for any emergency, but he was not the sort of man
to realise danger quickly, to rise promptly. What was needed now was
not bravery, but circumspection. My only consolation was to believe
that the Martians were moving Londonward and away from her. Such vague
anxieties keep the mind sensitive and painful. I grew very weary and
irritable with the curate’s perpetual ejaculations; I tired of the
sight of his selfish despair. After some ineffectual remonstrance I
kept away from him, staying in a room—evidently a children’s
schoolroom—containing globes, forms, and copybooks. When he followed me
thither, I went to a box room at the top of the house and, in order to
be alone with my aching miseries, locked myself in.

We were hopelessly hemmed in by the Black Smoke all that day and the
morning of the next. There were signs of people in the next house on
Sunday evening—a face at a window and moving lights, and later the
slamming of a door. But I do not know who these people were, nor what
became of them. We saw nothing of them next day. The Black Smoke
drifted slowly riverward all through Monday morning, creeping nearer
and nearer to us, driving at last along the roadway outside the house
that hid us.

A Martian came across the fields about midday, laying the stuff with a
jet of superheated steam that hissed against the walls, smashed all the
windows it touched, and scalded the curate’s hand as he fled out of the
front room. When at last we crept across the sodden rooms and looked
out again, the country northward was as though a black snowstorm had
passed over it. Looking towards the river, we were astonished to see an
unaccountable redness mingling with the black of the scorched meadows.

For a time we did not see how this change affected our position, save
that we were relieved of our fear of the Black Smoke. But later I
perceived that we were no longer hemmed in, that now we might get away.
So soon as I realised that the way of escape was open, my dream of
action returned. But the curate was lethargic, unreasonable.

“We are safe here,” he repeated; “safe here.”

I resolved to leave him—would that I had! Wiser now for the
artilleryman’s teaching, I sought out food and drink. I had found oil
and rags for my burns, and I also took a hat and a flannel shirt that I
found in one of the bedrooms. When it was clear to him that I meant to
go alone—had reconciled myself to going alone—he suddenly roused
himself to come. And all being quiet throughout the afternoon, we
started about five o’clock, as I should judge, along the blackened road
to Sunbury.

In Sunbury, and at intervals along the road, were dead bodies lying in
contorted attitudes, horses as well as men, overturned carts and
luggage, all covered thickly with black dust. That pall of cindery
powder made me think of what I had read of the destruction of Pompeii.
We got to Hampton Court without misadventure, our minds full of strange
and unfamiliar appearances, and at Hampton Court our eyes were relieved
to find a patch of green that had escaped the suffocating drift. We
went through Bushey Park, with its deer going to and fro under the
chestnuts, and some men and women hurrying in the distance towards
Hampton, and so we came to Twickenham. These were the first people we
saw.

Away across the road the woods beyond Ham and Petersham were still
afire. Twickenham was uninjured by either Heat-Ray or Black Smoke, and
there were more people about here, though none could give us news. For
the most part they were like ourselves, taking advantage of a lull to
shift their quarters. I have an impression that many of the houses here
were still occupied by scared inhabitants, too frightened even for
flight. Here too the evidence of a hasty rout was abundant along the
road. I remember most vividly three smashed bicycles in a heap, pounded
into the road by the wheels of subsequent carts. We crossed Richmond
Bridge about half past eight. We hurried across the exposed bridge, of
course, but I noticed floating down the stream a number of red masses,
some many feet across. I did not know what these were—there was no time
for scrutiny—and I put a more horrible interpretation on them than they
deserved. Here again on the Surrey side were black dust that had once
been smoke, and dead bodies—a heap near the approach to the station;
but we had no glimpse of the Martians until we were some way towards
Barnes.

We saw in the blackened distance a group of three people running down a
side street towards the river, but otherwise it seemed deserted. Up the
hill Richmond town was burning briskly; outside the town of Richmond
there was no trace of the Black Smoke.

Then suddenly, as we approached Kew, came a number of people running,
and the upperworks of a Martian fighting-machine loomed in sight over
the housetops, not a hundred yards away from us. We stood aghast at our
danger, and had the Martian looked down we must immediately have
perished. We were so terrified that we dared not go on, but turned
aside and hid in a shed in a garden. There the curate crouched, weeping
silently, and refusing to stir again.

But my fixed idea of reaching Leatherhead would not let me rest, and in
the twilight I ventured out again. I went through a shrubbery, and
along a passage beside a big house standing in its own grounds, and so
emerged upon the road towards Kew. The curate I left in the shed, but
he came hurrying after me.

That second start was the most foolhardy thing I ever did. For it was
manifest the Martians were about us. No sooner had the curate overtaken
me than we saw either the fighting-machine we had seen before or
another, far away across the meadows in the direction of Kew Lodge.
Four or five little black figures hurried before it across the
green-grey of the field, and in a moment it was evident this Martian
pursued them. In three strides he was among them, and they ran
radiating from his feet in all directions. He used no Heat-Ray to
destroy them, but picked them up one by one. Apparently he tossed them
into the great metallic carrier which projected behind him, much as a
workman’s basket hangs over his shoulder.

It was the first time I realised that the Martians might have any other
purpose than destruction with defeated humanity. We stood for a moment
petrified, then turned and fled through a gate behind us into a walled
garden, fell into, rather than found, a fortunate ditch, and lay there,
scarce daring to whisper to each other until the stars were out.

I suppose it was nearly eleven o’clock before we gathered courage to
start again, no longer venturing into the road, but sneaking along
hedgerows and through plantations, and watching keenly through the
darkness, he on the right and I on the left, for the Martians, who
seemed to be all about us. In one place we blundered upon a scorched
and blackened area, now cooling and ashen, and a number of scattered
dead bodies of men, burned horribly about the heads and trunks but with
their legs and boots mostly intact; and of dead horses, fifty feet,
perhaps, behind a line of four ripped guns and smashed gun carriages.

Sheen, it seemed, had escaped destruction, but the place was silent and
deserted. Here we happened on no dead, though the night was too dark
for us to see into the side roads of the place. In Sheen my companion
suddenly complained of faintness and thirst, and we decided to try one
of the houses.

The first house we entered, after a little difficulty with the window,
was a small semi-detached villa, and I found nothing eatable left in
the place but some mouldy cheese. There was, however, water to drink;
and I took a hatchet, which promised to be useful in our next
house-breaking.

We then crossed to a place where the road turns towards Mortlake. Here
there stood a white house within a walled garden, and in the pantry of
this domicile we found a store of food—two loaves of bread in a pan, an
uncooked steak, and the half of a ham. I give this catalogue so
precisely because, as it happened, we were destined to subsist upon
this store for the next fortnight. Bottled beer stood under a shelf,
and there were two bags of haricot beans and some limp lettuces. This
pantry opened into a kind of wash-up kitchen, and in this was firewood;
there was also a cupboard, in which we found nearly a dozen of
burgundy, tinned soups and salmon, and two tins of biscuits.

We sat in the adjacent kitchen in the dark—for we dared not strike a
light—and ate bread and ham, and drank beer out of the same bottle. The
curate, who was still timorous and restless, was now, oddly enough, for
pushing on, and I was urging him to keep up his strength by eating when
the thing happened that was to imprison us.

“It can’t be midnight yet,” I said, and then came a blinding glare of
vivid green light. Everything in the kitchen leaped out, clearly
visible in green and black, and vanished again. And then followed such
a concussion as I have never heard before or since. So close on the
heels of this as to seem instantaneous came a thud behind me, a clash
of glass, a crash and rattle of falling masonry all about us, and the
plaster of the ceiling came down upon us, smashing into a multitude of
fragments upon our heads. I was knocked headlong across the floor
against the oven handle and stunned. I was insensible for a long time,
the curate told me, and when I came to we were in darkness again, and
he, with a face wet, as I found afterwards, with blood from a cut
forehead, was dabbing water over me.

For some time I could not recollect what had happened. Then things came
to me slowly. A bruise on my temple asserted itself.

“Are you better?” asked the curate in a whisper.

At last I answered him. I sat up.

“Don’t move,” he said. “The floor is covered with smashed crockery from
the dresser. You can’t possibly move without making a noise, and I
fancy _they_ are outside.”

We both sat quite silent, so that we could scarcely hear each other
breathing. Everything seemed deadly still, but once something near us,
some plaster or broken brickwork, slid down with a rumbling sound.
Outside and very near was an intermittent, metallic rattle.

“That!” said the curate, when presently it happened again.

“Yes,” I said. “But what is it?”

“A Martian!” said the curate.

I listened again.

“It was not like the Heat-Ray,” I said, and for a time I was inclined
to think one of the great fighting-machines had stumbled against the
house, as I had seen one stumble against the tower of Shepperton
Church.

Our situation was so strange and incomprehensible that for three or
four hours, until the dawn came, we scarcely moved. And then the light
filtered in, not through the window, which remained black, but through
a triangular aperture between a beam and a heap of broken bricks in the
wall behind us. The interior of the kitchen we now saw greyly for the
first time.

The window had been burst in by a mass of garden mould, which flowed
over the table upon which we had been sitting and lay about our feet.
Outside, the soil was banked high against the house. At the top of the
window frame we could see an uprooted drainpipe. The floor was littered
with smashed hardware; the end of the kitchen towards the house was
broken into, and since the daylight shone in there, it was evident the
greater part of the house had collapsed. Contrasting vividly with this
ruin was the neat dresser, stained in the fashion, pale green, and with
a number of copper and tin vessels below it, the wallpaper imitating
blue and white tiles, and a couple of coloured supplements fluttering
from the walls above the kitchen range.

As the dawn grew clearer, we saw through the gap in the wall the body
of a Martian, standing sentinel, I suppose, over the still glowing
cylinder. At the sight of that we crawled as circumspectly as possible
out of the twilight of the kitchen into the darkness of the scullery.

Abruptly the right interpretation dawned upon my mind.

“The fifth cylinder,” I whispered, “the fifth shot from Mars, has
struck this house and buried us under the ruins!”

For a time the curate was silent, and then he whispered:

“God have mercy upon us!”

I heard him presently whimpering to himself.

Save for that sound we lay quite still in the scullery; I for my part
scarce dared breathe, and sat with my eyes fixed on the faint light of
the kitchen door. I could just see the curate’s face, a dim, oval
shape, and his collar and cuffs. Outside there began a metallic
hammering, then a violent hooting, and then again, after a quiet
interval, a hissing like the hissing of an engine. These noises, for
the most part problematical, continued intermittently, and seemed if
anything to increase in number as time wore on. Presently a measured
thudding and a vibration that made everything about us quiver and the
vessels in the pantry ring and shift, began and continued. Once the
light was eclipsed, and the ghostly kitchen doorway became absolutely
dark. For many hours we must have crouched there, silent and shivering,
until our tired attention failed. . . .

At last I found myself awake and very hungry. I am inclined to believe
we must have spent the greater portion of a day before that awakening.
My hunger was at a stride so insistent that it moved me to action. I
told the curate I was going to seek food, and felt my way towards the
pantry. He made me no answer, but so soon as I began eating the faint
noise I made stirred him up and I heard him crawling after me.




II.
WHAT WE SAW FROM THE RUINED HOUSE.


After eating we crept back to the scullery, and there I must have dozed
again, for when presently I looked round I was alone. The thudding
vibration continued with wearisome persistence. I whispered for the
curate several times, and at last felt my way to the door of the
kitchen. It was still daylight, and I perceived him across the room,
lying against the triangular hole that looked out upon the Martians.
His shoulders were hunched, so that his head was hidden from me.

I could hear a number of noises almost like those in an engine shed;
and the place rocked with that beating thud. Through the aperture in
the wall I could see the top of a tree touched with gold and the warm
blue of a tranquil evening sky. For a minute or so I remained watching
the curate, and then I advanced, crouching and stepping with extreme
care amid the broken crockery that littered the floor.

I touched the curate’s leg, and he started so violently that a mass of
plaster went sliding down outside and fell with a loud impact. I
gripped his arm, fearing he might cry out, and for a long time we
crouched motionless. Then I turned to see how much of our rampart
remained. The detachment of the plaster had left a vertical slit open
in the debris, and by raising myself cautiously across a beam I was
able to see out of this gap into what had been overnight a quiet
suburban roadway. Vast, indeed, was the change that we beheld.

The fifth cylinder must have fallen right into the midst of the house
we had first visited. The building had vanished, completely smashed,
pulverised, and dispersed by the blow. The cylinder lay now far beneath
the original foundations—deep in a hole, already vastly larger than the
pit I had looked into at Woking. The earth all round it had splashed
under that tremendous impact—“splashed” is the only word—and lay in
heaped piles that hid the masses of the adjacent houses. It had behaved
exactly like mud under the violent blow of a hammer. Our house had
collapsed backward; the front portion, even on the ground floor, had
been destroyed completely; by a chance the kitchen and scullery had
escaped, and stood buried now under soil and ruins, closed in by tons
of earth on every side save towards the cylinder. Over that aspect we
hung now on the very edge of the great circular pit the Martians were
engaged in making. The heavy beating sound was evidently just behind
us, and ever and again a bright green vapour drove up like a veil
across our peephole.

The cylinder was already opened in the centre of the pit, and on the
farther edge of the pit, amid the smashed and gravel-heaped shrubbery,
one of the great fighting-machines, deserted by its occupant, stood
stiff and tall against the evening sky. At first I scarcely noticed the
pit and the cylinder, although it has been convenient to describe them
first, on account of the extraordinary glittering mechanism I saw busy
in the excavation, and on account of the strange creatures that were
crawling slowly and painfully across the heaped mould near it.

The mechanism it certainly was that held my attention first. It was one
of those complicated fabrics that have since been called
handling-machines, and the study of which has already given such an
enormous impetus to terrestrial invention. As it dawned upon me first,
it presented a sort of metallic spider with five jointed, agile legs,
and with an extraordinary number of jointed levers, bars, and reaching
and clutching tentacles about its body. Most of its arms were
retracted, but with three long tentacles it was fishing out a number of
rods, plates, and bars which lined the covering and apparently
strengthened the walls of the cylinder. These, as it extracted them,
were lifted out and deposited upon a level surface of earth behind it.

Its motion was so swift, complex, and perfect that at first I did not
see it as a machine, in spite of its metallic glitter. The
fighting-machines were coordinated and animated to an extraordinary
pitch, but nothing to compare with this. People who have never seen
these structures, and have only the ill-imagined efforts of artists or
the imperfect descriptions of such eye-witnesses as myself to go upon,
scarcely realise that living quality.

I recall particularly the illustration of one of the first pamphlets to
give a consecutive account of the war. The artist had evidently made a
hasty study of one of the fighting-machines, and there his knowledge
ended. He presented them as tilted, stiff tripods, without either
flexibility or subtlety, and with an altogether misleading monotony of
effect. The pamphlet containing these renderings had a considerable
vogue, and I mention them here simply to warn the reader against the
impression they may have created. They were no more like the Martians I
saw in action than a Dutch doll is like a human being. To my mind, the
pamphlet would have been much better without them.

At first, I say, the handling-machine did not impress me as a machine,
but as a crablike creature with a glittering integument, the
controlling Martian whose delicate tentacles actuated its movements
seeming to be simply the equivalent of the crab’s cerebral portion. But
then I perceived the resemblance of its grey-brown, shiny, leathery
integument to that of the other sprawling bodies beyond, and the true
nature of this dexterous workman dawned upon me. With that realisation
my interest shifted to those other creatures, the real Martians.
Already I had had a transient impression of these, and the first nausea
no longer obscured my observation. Moreover, I was concealed and
motionless, and under no urgency of action.

They were, I now saw, the most unearthly creatures it is possible to
conceive. They were huge round bodies—or, rather, heads—about four feet
in diameter, each body having in front of it a face. This face had no
nostrils—indeed, the Martians do not seem to have had any sense of
smell, but it had a pair of very large dark-coloured eyes, and just
beneath this a kind of fleshy beak. In the back of this head or body—I
scarcely know how to speak of it—was the single tight tympanic surface,
since known to be anatomically an ear, though it must have been almost
useless in our dense air. In a group round the mouth were sixteen
slender, almost whiplike tentacles, arranged in two bunches of eight
each. These bunches have since been named rather aptly, by that
distinguished anatomist, Professor Howes, the _hands_. Even as I saw
these Martians for the first time they seemed to be endeavouring to
raise themselves on these hands, but of course, with the increased
weight of terrestrial conditions, this was impossible. There is reason
to suppose that on Mars they may have progressed upon them with some
facility.

The internal anatomy, I may remark here, as dissection has since shown,
was almost equally simple. The greater part of the structure was the
brain, sending enormous nerves to the eyes, ear, and tactile tentacles.
Besides this were the bulky lungs, into which the mouth opened, and the
heart and its vessels. The pulmonary distress caused by the denser
atmosphere and greater gravitational attraction was only too evident in
the convulsive movements of the outer skin.

And this was the sum of the Martian organs. Strange as it may seem to a
human being, all the complex apparatus of digestion, which makes up the
bulk of our bodies, did not exist in the Martians. They were
heads—merely heads. Entrails they had none. They did not eat, much less
digest. Instead, they took the fresh, living blood of other creatures,
and _injected_ it into their own veins. I have myself seen this being
done, as I shall mention in its place. But, squeamish as I may seem, I
cannot bring myself to describe what I could not endure even to
continue watching. Let it suffice to say, blood obtained from a still
living animal, in most cases from a human being, was run directly by
means of a little pipette into the recipient canal. . . .

The bare idea of this is no doubt horribly repulsive to us, but at the
same time I think that we should remember how repulsive our carnivorous
habits would seem to an intelligent rabbit.

The physiological advantages of the practice of injection are
undeniable, if one thinks of the tremendous waste of human time and
energy occasioned by eating and the digestive process. Our bodies are
half made up of glands and tubes and organs, occupied in turning
heterogeneous food into blood. The digestive processes and their
reaction upon the nervous system sap our strength and colour our minds.
Men go happy or miserable as they have healthy or unhealthy livers, or
sound gastric glands. But the Martians were lifted above all these
organic fluctuations of mood and emotion.

Their undeniable preference for men as their source of nourishment is
partly explained by the nature of the remains of the victims they had
brought with them as provisions from Mars. These creatures, to judge
from the shrivelled remains that have fallen into human hands, were
bipeds with flimsy, silicious skeletons (almost like those of the
silicious sponges) and feeble musculature, standing about six feet high
and having round, erect heads, and large eyes in flinty sockets. Two or
three of these seem to have been brought in each cylinder, and all were
killed before earth was reached. It was just as well for them, for the
mere attempt to stand upright upon our planet would have broken every
bone in their bodies.

And while I am engaged in this description, I may add in this place
certain further details which, although they were not all evident to us
at the time, will enable the reader who is unacquainted with them to
form a clearer picture of these offensive creatures.

In three other points their physiology differed strangely from ours.
Their organisms did not sleep, any more than the heart of man sleeps.
Since they had no extensive muscular mechanism to recuperate, that
periodical extinction was unknown to them. They had little or no sense
of fatigue, it would seem. On earth they could never have moved without
effort, yet even to the last they kept in action. In twenty-four hours
they did twenty-four hours of work, as even on earth is perhaps the
case with the ants.

In the next place, wonderful as it seems in a sexual world, the
Martians were absolutely without sex, and therefore without any of the
tumultuous emotions that arise from that difference among men. A young
Martian, there can now be no dispute, was really born upon earth during
the war, and it was found attached to its parent, partially _budded_
off, just as young lilybulbs bud off, or like the young animals in the
fresh-water polyp.

In man, in all the higher terrestrial animals, such a method of
increase has disappeared; but even on this earth it was certainly the
primitive method. Among the lower animals, up even to those first
cousins of the vertebrated animals, the Tunicates, the two processes
occur side by side, but finally the sexual method superseded its
competitor altogether. On Mars, however, just the reverse has
apparently been the case.

It is worthy of remark that a certain speculative writer of
quasi-scientific repute, writing long before the Martian invasion, did
forecast for man a final structure not unlike the actual Martian
condition. His prophecy, I remember, appeared in November or December,
1893, in a long-defunct publication, the _Pall Mall Budget_, and I
recall a caricature of it in a pre-Martian periodical called _Punch_.
He pointed out—writing in a foolish, facetious tone—that the perfection
of mechanical appliances must ultimately supersede limbs; the
perfection of chemical devices, digestion; that such organs as hair,
external nose, teeth, ears, and chin were no longer essential parts of
the human being, and that the tendency of natural selection would lie
in the direction of their steady diminution through the coming ages.
The brain alone remained a cardinal necessity. Only one other part of
the body had a strong case for survival, and that was the hand,
“teacher and agent of the brain.” While the rest of the body dwindled,
the hands would grow larger.

There is many a true word written in jest, and here in the Martians we
have beyond dispute the actual accomplishment of such a suppression of
the animal side of the organism by the intelligence. To me it is quite
credible that the Martians may be descended from beings not unlike
ourselves, by a gradual development of brain and hands (the latter
giving rise to the two bunches of delicate tentacles at last) at the
expense of the rest of the body. Without the body the brain would, of
course, become a mere selfish intelligence, without any of the
emotional substratum of the human being.

The last salient point in which the systems of these creatures differed
from ours was in what one might have thought a very trivial particular.
Micro-organisms, which cause so much disease and pain on earth, have
either never appeared upon Mars or Martian sanitary science eliminated
them ages ago. A hundred diseases, all the fevers and contagions of
human life, consumption, cancers, tumours and such morbidities, never
enter the scheme of their life. And speaking of the differences between
the life on Mars and terrestrial life, I may allude here to the curious
suggestions of the red weed.

Apparently the vegetable kingdom in Mars, instead of having green for a
dominant colour, is of a vivid blood-red tint. At any rate, the seeds
which the Martians (intentionally or accidentally) brought with them
gave rise in all cases to red-coloured growths. Only that known
popularly as the red weed, however, gained any footing in competition
with terrestrial forms. The red creeper was quite a transitory growth,
and few people have seen it growing. For a time, however, the red weed
grew with astonishing vigour and luxuriance. It spread up the sides of
the pit by the third or fourth day of our imprisonment, and its
cactus-like branches formed a carmine fringe to the edges of our
triangular window. And afterwards I found it broadcast throughout the
country, and especially wherever there was a stream of water.

The Martians had what appears to have been an auditory organ, a single
round drum at the back of the head-body, and eyes with a visual range
not very different from ours except that, according to Philips, blue
and violet were as black to them. It is commonly supposed that they
communicated by sounds and tentacular gesticulations; this is asserted,
for instance, in the able but hastily compiled pamphlet (written
evidently by someone not an eye-witness of Martian actions) to which I
have already alluded, and which, so far, has been the chief source of
information concerning them. Now no surviving human being saw so much
of the Martians in action as I did. I take no credit to myself for an
accident, but the fact is so. And I assert that I watched them closely
time after time, and that I have seen four, five, and (once) six of
them sluggishly performing the most elaborately complicated operations
together without either sound or gesture. Their peculiar hooting
invariably preceded feeding; it had no modulation, and was, I believe,
in no sense a signal, but merely the expiration of air preparatory to
the suctional operation. I have a certain claim to at least an
elementary knowledge of psychology, and in this matter I am
convinced—as firmly as I am convinced of anything—that the Martians
interchanged thoughts without any physical intermediation. And I have
been convinced of this in spite of strong preconceptions. Before the
Martian invasion, as an occasional reader here or there may remember, I
had written with some little vehemence against the telepathic theory.

The Martians wore no clothing. Their conceptions of ornament and
decorum were necessarily different from ours; and not only were they
evidently much less sensible of changes of temperature than we are, but
changes of pressure do not seem to have affected their health at all
seriously. Yet though they wore no clothing, it was in the other
artificial additions to their bodily resources that their great
superiority over man lay. We men, with our bicycles and road-skates,
our Lilienthal soaring-machines, our guns and sticks and so forth, are
just in the beginning of the evolution that the Martians have worked
out. They have become practically mere brains, wearing different bodies
according to their needs just as men wear suits of clothes and take a
bicycle in a hurry or an umbrella in the wet. And of their appliances,
perhaps nothing is more wonderful to a man than the curious fact that
what is the dominant feature of almost all human devices in mechanism
is absent—the _wheel_ is absent; among all the things they brought to
earth there is no trace or suggestion of their use of wheels. One would
have at least expected it in locomotion. And in this connection it is
curious to remark that even on this earth Nature has never hit upon the
wheel, or has preferred other expedients to its development. And not
only did the Martians either not know of (which is incredible), or
abstain from, the wheel, but in their apparatus singularly little use
is made of the fixed pivot or relatively fixed pivot, with circular
motions thereabout confined to one plane. Almost all the joints of the
machinery present a complicated system of sliding parts moving over
small but beautifully curved friction bearings. And while upon this
matter of detail, it is remarkable that the long leverages of their
machines are in most cases actuated by a sort of sham musculature of
the disks in an elastic sheath; these disks become polarised and drawn
closely and powerfully together when traversed by a current of
electricity. In this way the curious parallelism to animal motions,
which was so striking and disturbing to the human beholder, was
attained. Such quasi-muscles abounded in the crablike handling-machine
which, on my first peeping out of the slit, I watched unpacking the
cylinder. It seemed infinitely more alive than the actual Martians
lying beyond it in the sunset light, panting, stirring ineffectual
tentacles, and moving feebly after their vast journey across space.

While I was still watching their sluggish motions in the sunlight, and
noting each strange detail of their form, the curate reminded me of his
presence by pulling violently at my arm. I turned to a scowling face,
and silent, eloquent lips. He wanted the slit, which permitted only one
of us to peep through; and so I had to forego watching them for a time
while he enjoyed that privilege.

When I looked again, the busy handling-machine had already put together
several of the pieces of apparatus it had taken out of the cylinder
into a shape having an unmistakable likeness to its own; and down on
the left a busy little digging mechanism had come into view, emitting
jets of green vapour and working its way round the pit, excavating and
embanking in a methodical and discriminating manner. This it was which
had caused the regular beating noise, and the rhythmic shocks that had
kept our ruinous refuge quivering. It piped and whistled as it worked.
So far as I could see, the thing was without a directing Martian at
all.




III.
THE DAYS OF IMPRISONMENT.


The arrival of a second fighting-machine drove us from our peephole
into the scullery, for we feared that from his elevation the Martian
might see down upon us behind our barrier. At a later date we began to
feel less in danger of their eyes, for to an eye in the dazzle of the
sunlight outside our refuge must have been blank blackness, but at
first the slightest suggestion of approach drove us into the scullery
in heart-throbbing retreat. Yet terrible as was the danger we incurred,
the attraction of peeping was for both of us irresistible. And I recall
now with a sort of wonder that, in spite of the infinite danger in
which we were between starvation and a still more terrible death, we
could yet struggle bitterly for that horrible privilege of sight. We
would race across the kitchen in a grotesque way between eagerness and
the dread of making a noise, and strike each other, and thrust and
kick, within a few inches of exposure.

The fact is that we had absolutely incompatible dispositions and habits
of thought and action, and our danger and isolation only accentuated
the incompatibility. At Halliford I had already come to hate the
curate’s trick of helpless exclamation, his stupid rigidity of mind.
His endless muttering monologue vitiated every effort I made to think
out a line of action, and drove me at times, thus pent up and
intensified, almost to the verge of craziness. He was as lacking in
restraint as a silly woman. He would weep for hours together, and I
verily believe that to the very end this spoiled child of life thought
his weak tears in some way efficacious. And I would sit in the darkness
unable to keep my mind off him by reason of his importunities. He ate
more than I did, and it was in vain I pointed out that our only chance
of life was to stop in the house until the Martians had done with their
pit, that in that long patience a time might presently come when we
should need food. He ate and drank impulsively in heavy meals at long
intervals. He slept little.

As the days wore on, his utter carelessness of any consideration so
intensified our distress and danger that I had, much as I loathed doing
it, to resort to threats, and at last to blows. That brought him to
reason for a time. But he was one of those weak creatures, void of
pride, timorous, anæmic, hateful souls, full of shifty cunning, who
face neither God nor man, who face not even themselves.

It is disagreeable for me to recall and write these things, but I set
them down that my story may lack nothing. Those who have escaped the
dark and terrible aspects of life will find my brutality, my flash of
rage in our final tragedy, easy enough to blame; for they know what is
wrong as well as any, but not what is possible to tortured men. But
those who have been under the shadow, who have gone down at last to
elemental things, will have a wider charity.

And while within we fought out our dark, dim contest of whispers,
snatched food and drink, and gripping hands and blows, without, in the
pitiless sunlight of that terrible June, was the strange wonder, the
unfamiliar routine of the Martians in the pit. Let me return to those
first new experiences of mine. After a long time I ventured back to the
peephole, to find that the new-comers had been reinforced by the
occupants of no fewer than three of the fighting-machines. These last
had brought with them certain fresh appliances that stood in an orderly
manner about the cylinder. The second handling-machine was now
completed, and was busied in serving one of the novel contrivances the
big machine had brought. This was a body resembling a milk can in its
general form, above which oscillated a pear-shaped receptacle, and from
which a stream of white powder flowed into a circular basin below.

The oscillatory motion was imparted to this by one tentacle of the
handling-machine. With two spatulate hands the handling-machine was
digging out and flinging masses of clay into the pear-shaped receptacle
above, while with another arm it periodically opened a door and removed
rusty and blackened clinkers from the middle part of the machine.
Another steely tentacle directed the powder from the basin along a
ribbed channel towards some receiver that was hidden from me by the
mound of bluish dust. From this unseen receiver a little thread of
green smoke rose vertically into the quiet air. As I looked, the
handling-machine, with a faint and musical clinking, extended,
telescopic fashion, a tentacle that had been a moment before a mere
blunt projection, until its end was hidden behind the mound of clay. In
another second it had lifted a bar of white aluminium into sight,
untarnished as yet, and shining dazzlingly, and deposited it in a
growing stack of bars that stood at the side of the pit. Between sunset
and starlight this dexterous machine must have made more than a hundred
such bars out of the crude clay, and the mound of bluish dust rose
steadily until it topped the side of the pit.

The contrast between the swift and complex movements of these
contrivances and the inert panting clumsiness of their masters was
acute, and for days I had to tell myself repeatedly that these latter
were indeed the living of the two things.

The curate had possession of the slit when the first men were brought
to the pit. I was sitting below, huddled up, listening with all my
ears. He made a sudden movement backward, and I, fearful that we were
observed, crouched in a spasm of terror. He came sliding down the
rubbish and crept beside me in the darkness, inarticulate,
gesticulating, and for a moment I shared his panic. His gesture
suggested a resignation of the slit, and after a little while my
curiosity gave me courage, and I rose up, stepped across him, and
clambered up to it. At first I could see no reason for his frantic
behaviour. The twilight had now come, the stars were little and faint,
but the pit was illuminated by the flickering green fire that came from
the aluminium-making. The whole picture was a flickering scheme of
green gleams and shifting rusty black shadows, strangely trying to the
eyes. Over and through it all went the bats, heeding it not at all. The
sprawling Martians were no longer to be seen, the mound of blue-green
powder had risen to cover them from sight, and a fighting-machine, with
its legs contracted, crumpled, and abbreviated, stood across the corner
of the pit. And then, amid the clangour of the machinery, came a
drifting suspicion of human voices, that I entertained at first only to
dismiss.

I crouched, watching this fighting-machine closely, satisfying myself
now for the first time that the hood did indeed contain a Martian. As
the green flames lifted I could see the oily gleam of his integument
and the brightness of his eyes. And suddenly I heard a yell, and saw a
long tentacle reaching over the shoulder of the machine to the little
cage that hunched upon its back. Then something—something struggling
violently—was lifted high against the sky, a black, vague enigma
against the starlight; and as this black object came down again, I saw
by the green brightness that it was a man. For an instant he was
clearly visible. He was a stout, ruddy, middle-aged man, well dressed;
three days before, he must have been walking the world, a man of
considerable consequence. I could see his staring eyes and gleams of
light on his studs and watch chain. He vanished behind the mound, and
for a moment there was silence. And then began a shrieking and a
sustained and cheerful hooting from the Martians.

I slid down the rubbish, struggled to my feet, clapped my hands over my
ears, and bolted into the scullery. The curate, who had been crouching
silently with his arms over his head, looked up as I passed, cried out
quite loudly at my desertion of him, and came running after me.

That night, as we lurked in the scullery, balanced between our horror
and the terrible fascination this peeping had, although I felt an
urgent need of action I tried in vain to conceive some plan of escape;
but afterwards, during the second day, I was able to consider our
position with great clearness. The curate, I found, was quite incapable
of discussion; this new and culminating atrocity had robbed him of all
vestiges of reason or forethought. Practically he had already sunk to
the level of an animal. But as the saying goes, I gripped myself with
both hands. It grew upon my mind, once I could face the facts, that
terrible as our position was, there was as yet no justification for
absolute despair. Our chief chance lay in the possibility of the
Martians making the pit nothing more than a temporary encampment. Or
even if they kept it permanently, they might not consider it necessary
to guard it, and a chance of escape might be afforded us. I also
weighed very carefully the possibility of our digging a way out in a
direction away from the pit, but the chances of our emerging within
sight of some sentinel fighting-machine seemed at first too great. And
I should have had to do all the digging myself. The curate would
certainly have failed me.

It was on the third day, if my memory serves me right, that I saw the
lad killed. It was the only occasion on which I actually saw the
Martians feed. After that experience I avoided the hole in the wall for
the better part of a day. I went into the scullery, removed the door,
and spent some hours digging with my hatchet as silently as possible;
but when I had made a hole about a couple of feet deep the loose earth
collapsed noisily, and I did not dare continue. I lost heart, and lay
down on the scullery floor for a long time, having no spirit even to
move. And after that I abandoned altogether the idea of escaping by
excavation.

It says much for the impression the Martians had made upon me that at
first I entertained little or no hope of our escape being brought about
by their overthrow through any human effort. But on the fourth or fifth
night I heard a sound like heavy guns.

It was very late in the night, and the moon was shining brightly. The
Martians had taken away the excavating-machine, and, save for a
fighting-machine that stood in the remoter bank of the pit and a
handling-machine that was buried out of my sight in a corner of the pit
immediately beneath my peephole, the place was deserted by them. Except
for the pale glow from the handling-machine and the bars and patches of
white moonlight the pit was in darkness, and, except for the clinking
of the handling-machine, quite still. That night was a beautiful
serenity; save for one planet, the moon seemed to have the sky to
herself. I heard a dog howling, and that familiar sound it was that
made me listen. Then I heard quite distinctly a booming exactly like
the sound of great guns. Six distinct reports I counted, and after a
long interval six again. And that was all.




IV.
THE DEATH OF THE CURATE.


It was on the sixth day of our imprisonment that I peeped for the last
time, and presently found myself alone. Instead of keeping close to me
and trying to oust me from the slit, the curate had gone back into the
scullery. I was struck by a sudden thought. I went back quickly and
quietly into the scullery. In the darkness I heard the curate drinking.
I snatched in the darkness, and my fingers caught a bottle of burgundy.

For a few minutes there was a tussle. The bottle struck the floor and
broke, and I desisted and rose. We stood panting and threatening each
other. In the end I planted myself between him and the food, and told
him of my determination to begin a discipline. I divided the food in
the pantry, into rations to last us ten days. I would not let him eat
any more that day. In the afternoon he made a feeble effort to get at
the food. I had been dozing, but in an instant I was awake. All day and
all night we sat face to face, I weary but resolute, and he weeping and
complaining of his immediate hunger. It was, I know, a night and a day,
but to me it seemed—it seems now—an interminable length of time.

And so our widened incompatibility ended at last in open conflict. For
two vast days we struggled in undertones and wrestling contests. There
were times when I beat and kicked him madly, times when I cajoled and
persuaded him, and once I tried to bribe him with the last bottle of
burgundy, for there was a rain-water pump from which I could get water.
But neither force nor kindness availed; he was indeed beyond reason. He
would neither desist from his attacks on the food nor from his noisy
babbling to himself. The rudimentary precautions to keep our
imprisonment endurable he would not observe. Slowly I began to realise
the complete overthrow of his intelligence, to perceive that my sole
companion in this close and sickly darkness was a man insane.

From certain vague memories I am inclined to think my own mind wandered
at times. I had strange and hideous dreams whenever I slept. It sounds
paradoxical, but I am inclined to think that the weakness and insanity
of the curate warned me, braced me, and kept me a sane man.

On the eighth day he began to talk aloud instead of whispering, and
nothing I could do would moderate his speech.

“It is just, O God!” he would say, over and over again. “It is just. On
me and mine be the punishment laid. We have sinned, we have fallen
short. There was poverty, sorrow; the poor were trodden in the dust,
and I held my peace. I preached acceptable folly—my God, what
folly!—when I should have stood up, though I died for it, and called
upon them to repent—repent! . . . Oppressors of the poor and needy . .
. ! The wine press of God!”

Then he would suddenly revert to the matter of the food I withheld from
him, praying, begging, weeping, at last threatening. He began to raise
his voice—I prayed him not to. He perceived a hold on me—he threatened
he would shout and bring the Martians upon us. For a time that scared
me; but any concession would have shortened our chance of escape beyond
estimating. I defied him, although I felt no assurance that he might
not do this thing. But that day, at any rate, he did not. He talked
with his voice rising slowly, through the greater part of the eighth
and ninth days—threats, entreaties, mingled with a torrent of half-sane
and always frothy repentance for his vacant sham of God’s service, such
as made me pity him. Then he slept awhile, and began again with renewed
strength, so loudly that I must needs make him desist.

“Be still!” I implored.

He rose to his knees, for he had been sitting in the darkness near the
copper.

“I have been still too long,” he said, in a tone that must have reached
the pit, “and now I must bear my witness. Woe unto this unfaithful
city! Woe! Woe! Woe! Woe! Woe! To the inhabitants of the earth by
reason of the other voices of the trumpet——”

“Shut up!” I said, rising to my feet, and in a terror lest the Martians
should hear us. “For God’s sake——”

“Nay,” shouted the curate, at the top of his voice, standing likewise
and extending his arms. “Speak! The word of the Lord is upon me!”

In three strides he was at the door leading into the kitchen.

“I must bear my witness! I go! It has already been too long delayed.”

I put out my hand and felt the meat chopper hanging to the wall. In a
flash I was after him. I was fierce with fear. Before he was halfway
across the kitchen I had overtaken him. With one last touch of humanity
I turned the blade back and struck him with the butt. He went headlong
forward and lay stretched on the ground. I stumbled over him and stood
panting. He lay still.

Suddenly I heard a noise without, the run and smash of slipping
plaster, and the triangular aperture in the wall was darkened. I looked
up and saw the lower surface of a handling-machine coming slowly across
the hole. One of its gripping limbs curled amid the debris; another
limb appeared, feeling its way over the fallen beams. I stood
petrified, staring. Then I saw through a sort of glass plate near the
edge of the body the face, as we may call it, and the large dark eyes
of a Martian, peering, and then a long metallic snake of tentacle came
feeling slowly through the hole.

I turned by an effort, stumbled over the curate, and stopped at the
scullery door. The tentacle was now some way, two yards or more, in the
room, and twisting and turning, with queer sudden movements, this way
and that. For a while I stood fascinated by that slow, fitful advance.
Then, with a faint, hoarse cry, I forced myself across the scullery. I
trembled violently; I could scarcely stand upright. I opened the door
of the coal cellar, and stood there in the darkness staring at the
faintly lit doorway into the kitchen, and listening. Had the Martian
seen me? What was it doing now?

Something was moving to and fro there, very quietly; every now and then
it tapped against the wall, or started on its movements with a faint
metallic ringing, like the movements of keys on a split-ring. Then a
heavy body—I knew too well what—was dragged across the floor of the
kitchen towards the opening. Irresistibly attracted, I crept to the
door and peeped into the kitchen. In the triangle of bright outer
sunlight I saw the Martian, in its Briareus of a handling-machine,
scrutinizing the curate’s head. I thought at once that it would infer
my presence from the mark of the blow I had given him.

I crept back to the coal cellar, shut the door, and began to cover
myself up as much as I could, and as noiselessly as possible in the
darkness, among the firewood and coal therein. Every now and then I
paused, rigid, to hear if the Martian had thrust its tentacles through
the opening again.

Then the faint metallic jingle returned. I traced it slowly feeling
over the kitchen. Presently I heard it nearer—in the scullery, as I
judged. I thought that its length might be insufficient to reach me. I
prayed copiously. It passed, scraping faintly across the cellar door.
An age of almost intolerable suspense intervened; then I heard it
fumbling at the latch! It had found the door! The Martians understood
doors!

It worried at the catch for a minute, perhaps, and then the door
opened.

In the darkness I could just see the thing—like an elephant’s trunk
more than anything else—waving towards me and touching and examining
the wall, coals, wood and ceiling. It was like a black worm swaying its
blind head to and fro.

Once, even, it touched the heel of my boot. I was on the verge of
screaming; I bit my hand. For a time the tentacle was silent. I could
have fancied it had been withdrawn. Presently, with an abrupt click, it
gripped something—I thought it had me!—and seemed to go out of the
cellar again. For a minute I was not sure. Apparently it had taken a
lump of coal to examine.

I seized the opportunity of slightly shifting my position, which had
become cramped, and then listened. I whispered passionate prayers for
safety.

Then I heard the slow, deliberate sound creeping towards me again.
Slowly, slowly it drew near, scratching against the walls and tapping
the furniture.

While I was still doubtful, it rapped smartly against the cellar door
and closed it. I heard it go into the pantry, and the biscuit-tins
rattled and a bottle smashed, and then came a heavy bump against the
cellar door. Then silence that passed into an infinity of suspense.

Had it gone?

At last I decided that it had.

It came into the scullery no more; but I lay all the tenth day in the
close darkness, buried among coals and firewood, not daring even to
crawl out for the drink for which I craved. It was the eleventh day
before I ventured so far from my security.




V.
THE STILLNESS.


My first act before I went into the pantry was to fasten the door
between the kitchen and the scullery. But the pantry was empty; every
scrap of food had gone. Apparently, the Martian had taken it all on the
previous day. At that discovery I despaired for the first time. I took
no food, or no drink either, on the eleventh or the twelfth day.

At first my mouth and throat were parched, and my strength ebbed
sensibly. I sat about in the darkness of the scullery, in a state of
despondent wretchedness. My mind ran on eating. I thought I had become
deaf, for the noises of movement I had been accustomed to hear from the
pit had ceased absolutely. I did not feel strong enough to crawl
noiselessly to the peephole, or I would have gone there.

On the twelfth day my throat was so painful that, taking the chance of
alarming the Martians, I attacked the creaking rain-water pump that
stood by the sink, and got a couple of glassfuls of blackened and
tainted rain water. I was greatly refreshed by this, and emboldened by
the fact that no enquiring tentacle followed the noise of my pumping.

During these days, in a rambling, inconclusive way, I thought much of
the curate and of the manner of his death.

On the thirteenth day I drank some more water, and dozed and thought
disjointedly of eating and of vague impossible plans of escape.
Whenever I dozed I dreamt of horrible phantasms, of the death of the
curate, or of sumptuous dinners; but, asleep or awake, I felt a keen
pain that urged me to drink again and again. The light that came into
the scullery was no longer grey, but red. To my disordered imagination
it seemed the colour of blood.

On the fourteenth day I went into the kitchen, and I was surprised to
find that the fronds of the red weed had grown right across the hole in
the wall, turning the half-light of the place into a crimson-coloured
obscurity.

It was early on the fifteenth day that I heard a curious, familiar
sequence of sounds in the kitchen, and, listening, identified it as the
snuffing and scratching of a dog. Going into the kitchen, I saw a dog’s
nose peering in through a break among the ruddy fronds. This greatly
surprised me. At the scent of me he barked shortly.

I thought if I could induce him to come into the place quietly I should
be able, perhaps, to kill and eat him; and in any case, it would be
advisable to kill him, lest his actions attracted the attention of the
Martians.

I crept forward, saying “Good dog!” very softly; but he suddenly
withdrew his head and disappeared.

I listened—I was not deaf—but certainly the pit was still. I heard a
sound like the flutter of a bird’s wings, and a hoarse croaking, but
that was all.

For a long while I lay close to the peephole, but not daring to move
aside the red plants that obscured it. Once or twice I heard a faint
pitter-patter like the feet of the dog going hither and thither on the
sand far below me, and there were more birdlike sounds, but that was
all. At length, encouraged by the silence, I looked out.

Except in the corner, where a multitude of crows hopped and fought over
the skeletons of the dead the Martians had consumed, there was not a
living thing in the pit.

I stared about me, scarcely believing my eyes. All the machinery had
gone. Save for the big mound of greyish-blue powder in one corner,
certain bars of aluminium in another, the black birds, and the
skeletons of the killed, the place was merely an empty circular pit in
the sand.

Slowly I thrust myself out through the red weed, and stood upon the
mound of rubble. I could see in any direction save behind me, to the
north, and neither Martians nor sign of Martians were to be seen. The
pit dropped sheerly from my feet, but a little way along the rubbish
afforded a practicable slope to the summit of the ruins. My chance of
escape had come. I began to tremble.

I hesitated for some time, and then, in a gust of desperate resolution,
and with a heart that throbbed violently, I scrambled to the top of the
mound in which I had been buried so long.

I looked about again. To the northward, too, no Martian was visible.

When I had last seen this part of Sheen in the daylight it had been a
straggling street of comfortable white and red houses, interspersed
with abundant shady trees. Now I stood on a mound of smashed brickwork,
clay, and gravel, over which spread a multitude of red cactus-shaped
plants, knee-high, without a solitary terrestrial growth to dispute
their footing. The trees near me were dead and brown, but further a
network of red thread scaled the still living stems.

The neighbouring houses had all been wrecked, but none had been burned;
their walls stood, sometimes to the second story, with smashed windows
and shattered doors. The red weed grew tumultuously in their roofless
rooms. Below me was the great pit, with the crows struggling for its
refuse. A number of other birds hopped about among the ruins. Far away
I saw a gaunt cat slink crouchingly along a wall, but traces of men
there were none.

The day seemed, by contrast with my recent confinement, dazzlingly
bright, the sky a glowing blue. A gentle breeze kept the red weed that
covered every scrap of unoccupied ground gently swaying. And oh! the
sweetness of the air!




VI.
THE WORK OF FIFTEEN DAYS.


For some time I stood tottering on the mound regardless of my safety.
Within that noisome den from which I had emerged I had thought with a
narrow intensity only of our immediate security. I had not realised
what had been happening to the world, had not anticipated this
startling vision of unfamiliar things. I had expected to see Sheen in
ruins—I found about me the landscape, weird and lurid, of another
planet.

For that moment I touched an emotion beyond the common range of men,
yet one that the poor brutes we dominate know only too well. I felt as
a rabbit might feel returning to his burrow and suddenly confronted by
the work of a dozen busy navvies digging the foundations of a house. I
felt the first inkling of a thing that presently grew quite clear in my
mind, that oppressed me for many days, a sense of dethronement, a
persuasion that I was no longer a master, but an animal among the
animals, under the Martian heel. With us it would be as with them, to
lurk and watch, to run and hide; the fear and empire of man had passed
away.

But so soon as this strangeness had been realised it passed, and my
dominant motive became the hunger of my long and dismal fast. In the
direction away from the pit I saw, beyond a red-covered wall, a patch
of garden ground unburied. This gave me a hint, and I went knee-deep,
and sometimes neck-deep, in the red weed. The density of the weed gave
me a reassuring sense of hiding. The wall was some six feet high, and
when I attempted to clamber it I found I could not lift my feet to the
crest. So I went along by the side of it, and came to a corner and a
rockwork that enabled me to get to the top, and tumble into the garden
I coveted. Here I found some young onions, a couple of gladiolus bulbs,
and a quantity of immature carrots, all of which I secured, and,
scrambling over a ruined wall, went on my way through scarlet and
crimson trees towards Kew—it was like walking through an avenue of
gigantic blood drops—possessed with two ideas: to get more food, and to
limp, as soon and as far as my strength permitted, out of this accursed
unearthly region of the pit.

Some way farther, in a grassy place, was a group of mushrooms which
also I devoured, and then I came upon a brown sheet of flowing shallow
water, where meadows used to be. These fragments of nourishment served
only to whet my hunger. At first I was surprised at this flood in a
hot, dry summer, but afterwards I discovered that it was caused by the
tropical exuberance of the red weed. Directly this extraordinary growth
encountered water it straightway became gigantic and of unparalleled
fecundity. Its seeds were simply poured down into the water of the Wey
and Thames, and its swiftly growing and Titanic water fronds speedily
choked both those rivers.

At Putney, as I afterwards saw, the bridge was almost lost in a tangle
of this weed, and at Richmond, too, the Thames water poured in a broad
and shallow stream across the meadows of Hampton and Twickenham. As the
water spread the weed followed them, until the ruined villas of the
Thames valley were for a time lost in this red swamp, whose margin I
explored, and much of the desolation the Martians had caused was
concealed.

In the end the red weed succumbed almost as quickly as it had spread. A
cankering disease, due, it is believed, to the action of certain
bacteria, presently seized upon it. Now by the action of natural
selection, all terrestrial plants have acquired a resisting power
against bacterial diseases—they never succumb without a severe
struggle, but the red weed rotted like a thing already dead. The fronds
became bleached, and then shrivelled and brittle. They broke off at the
least touch, and the waters that had stimulated their early growth
carried their last vestiges out to sea.

My first act on coming to this water was, of course, to slake my
thirst. I drank a great deal of it and, moved by an impulse, gnawed
some fronds of red weed; but they were watery, and had a sickly,
metallic taste. I found the water was sufficiently shallow for me to
wade securely, although the red weed impeded my feet a little; but the
flood evidently got deeper towards the river, and I turned back to
Mortlake. I managed to make out the road by means of occasional ruins
of its villas and fences and lamps, and so presently I got out of this
spate and made my way to the hill going up towards Roehampton and came
out on Putney Common.

Here the scenery changed from the strange and unfamiliar to the
wreckage of the familiar: patches of ground exhibited the devastation
of a cyclone, and in a few score yards I would come upon perfectly
undisturbed spaces, houses with their blinds trimly drawn and doors
closed, as if they had been left for a day by the owners, or as if
their inhabitants slept within. The red weed was less abundant; the
tall trees along the lane were free from the red creeper. I hunted for
food among the trees, finding nothing, and I also raided a couple of
silent houses, but they had already been broken into and ransacked. I
rested for the remainder of the daylight in a shrubbery, being, in my
enfeebled condition, too fatigued to push on.

All this time I saw no human beings, and no signs of the Martians. I
encountered a couple of hungry-looking dogs, but both hurried
circuitously away from the advances I made them. Near Roehampton I had
seen two human skeletons—not bodies, but skeletons, picked clean—and in
the wood by me I found the crushed and scattered bones of several cats
and rabbits and the skull of a sheep. But though I gnawed parts of
these in my mouth, there was nothing to be got from them.

After sunset I struggled on along the road towards Putney, where I
think the Heat-Ray must have been used for some reason. And in the
garden beyond Roehampton I got a quantity of immature potatoes,
sufficient to stay my hunger. From this garden one looked down upon
Putney and the river. The aspect of the place in the dusk was
singularly desolate: blackened trees, blackened, desolate ruins, and
down the hill the sheets of the flooded river, red-tinged with the
weed. And over all—silence. It filled me with indescribable terror to
think how swiftly that desolating change had come.

For a time I believed that mankind had been swept out of existence, and
that I stood there alone, the last man left alive. Hard by the top of
Putney Hill I came upon another skeleton, with the arms dislocated and
removed several yards from the rest of the body. As I proceeded I
became more and more convinced that the extermination of mankind was,
save for such stragglers as myself, already accomplished in this part
of the world. The Martians, I thought, had gone on and left the country
desolated, seeking food elsewhere. Perhaps even now they were
destroying Berlin or Paris, or it might be they had gone northward.




VII.
THE MAN ON PUTNEY HILL.


I spent that night in the inn that stands at the top of Putney Hill,
sleeping in a made bed for the first time since my flight to
Leatherhead. I will not tell the needless trouble I had breaking into
that house—afterwards I found the front door was on the latch—nor how I
ransacked every room for food, until just on the verge of despair, in
what seemed to me to be a servant’s bedroom, I found a rat-gnawed crust
and two tins of pineapple. The place had been already searched and
emptied. In the bar I afterwards found some biscuits and sandwiches
that had been overlooked. The latter I could not eat, they were too
rotten, but the former not only stayed my hunger, but filled my
pockets. I lit no lamps, fearing some Martian might come beating that
part of London for food in the night. Before I went to bed I had an
interval of restlessness, and prowled from window to window, peering
out for some sign of these monsters. I slept little. As I lay in bed I
found myself thinking consecutively—a thing I do not remember to have
done since my last argument with the curate. During all the intervening
time my mental condition had been a hurrying succession of vague
emotional states or a sort of stupid receptivity. But in the night my
brain, reinforced, I suppose, by the food I had eaten, grew clear
again, and I thought.

Three things struggled for possession of my mind: the killing of the
curate, the whereabouts of the Martians, and the possible fate of my
wife. The former gave me no sensation of horror or remorse to recall; I
saw it simply as a thing done, a memory infinitely disagreeable but
quite without the quality of remorse. I saw myself then as I see myself
now, driven step by step towards that hasty blow, the creature of a
sequence of accidents leading inevitably to that. I felt no
condemnation; yet the memory, static, unprogressive, haunted me. In the
silence of the night, with that sense of the nearness of God that
sometimes comes into the stillness and the darkness, I stood my trial,
my only trial, for that moment of wrath and fear. I retraced every step
of our conversation from the moment when I had found him crouching
beside me, heedless of my thirst, and pointing to the fire and smoke
that streamed up from the ruins of Weybridge. We had been incapable of
co-operation—grim chance had taken no heed of that. Had I foreseen, I
should have left him at Halliford. But I did not foresee; and crime is
to foresee and do. And I set this down as I have set all this story
down, as it was. There were no witnesses—all these things I might have
concealed. But I set it down, and the reader must form his judgment as
he will.

And when, by an effort, I had set aside that picture of a prostrate
body, I faced the problem of the Martians and the fate of my wife. For
the former I had no data; I could imagine a hundred things, and so,
unhappily, I could for the latter. And suddenly that night became
terrible. I found myself sitting up in bed, staring at the dark. I
found myself praying that the Heat-Ray might have suddenly and
painlessly struck her out of being. Since the night of my return from
Leatherhead I had not prayed. I had uttered prayers, fetish prayers,
had prayed as heathens mutter charms when I was in extremity; but now I
prayed indeed, pleading steadfastly and sanely, face to face with the
darkness of God. Strange night! Strangest in this, that so soon as dawn
had come, I, who had talked with God, crept out of the house like a rat
leaving its hiding place—a creature scarcely larger, an inferior
animal, a thing that for any passing whim of our masters might be
hunted and killed. Perhaps they also prayed confidently to God. Surely,
if we have learned nothing else, this war has taught us pity—pity for
those witless souls that suffer our dominion.

The morning was bright and fine, and the eastern sky glowed pink, and
was fretted with little golden clouds. In the road that runs from the
top of Putney Hill to Wimbledon was a number of poor vestiges of the
panic torrent that must have poured Londonward on the Sunday night
after the fighting began. There was a little two-wheeled cart inscribed
with the name of Thomas Lobb, Greengrocer, New Malden, with a smashed
wheel and an abandoned tin trunk; there was a straw hat trampled into
the now hardened mud, and at the top of West Hill a lot of
blood-stained glass about the overturned water trough. My movements
were languid, my plans of the vaguest. I had an idea of going to
Leatherhead, though I knew that there I had the poorest chance of
finding my wife. Certainly, unless death had overtaken them suddenly,
my cousins and she would have fled thence; but it seemed to me I might
find or learn there whither the Surrey people had fled. I knew I wanted
to find my wife, that my heart ached for her and the world of men, but
I had no clear idea how the finding might be done. I was also sharply
aware now of my intense loneliness. From the corner I went, under cover
of a thicket of trees and bushes, to the edge of Wimbledon Common,
stretching wide and far.

That dark expanse was lit in patches by yellow gorse and broom; there
was no red weed to be seen, and as I prowled, hesitating, on the verge
of the open, the sun rose, flooding it all with light and vitality. I
came upon a busy swarm of little frogs in a swampy place among the
trees. I stopped to look at them, drawing a lesson from their stout
resolve to live. And presently, turning suddenly, with an odd feeling
of being watched, I beheld something crouching amid a clump of bushes.
I stood regarding this. I made a step towards it, and it rose up and
became a man armed with a cutlass. I approached him slowly. He stood
silent and motionless, regarding me.

As I drew nearer I perceived he was dressed in clothes as dusty and
filthy as my own; he looked, indeed, as though he had been dragged
through a culvert. Nearer, I distinguished the green slime of ditches
mixing with the pale drab of dried clay and shiny, coaly patches. His
black hair fell over his eyes, and his face was dark and dirty and
sunken, so that at first I did not recognise him. There was a red cut
across the lower part of his face.

“Stop!” he cried, when I was within ten yards of him, and I stopped.
His voice was hoarse. “Where do you come from?” he said.

I thought, surveying him.

“I come from Mortlake,” I said. “I was buried near the pit the Martians
made about their cylinder. I have worked my way out and escaped.”

“There is no food about here,” he said. “This is my country. All this
hill down to the river, and back to Clapham, and up to the edge of the
common. There is only food for one. Which way are you going?”

I answered slowly.

“I don’t know,” I said. “I have been buried in the ruins of a house
thirteen or fourteen days. I don’t know what has happened.”

He looked at me doubtfully, then started, and looked with a changed
expression.

“I’ve no wish to stop about here,” said I. “I think I shall go to
Leatherhead, for my wife was there.”

He shot out a pointing finger.

“It is you,” said he; “the man from Woking. And you weren’t killed at
Weybridge?”

I recognised him at the same moment.

“You are the artilleryman who came into my garden.”

“Good luck!” he said. “We are lucky ones! Fancy _you_!” He put out a
hand, and I took it. “I crawled up a drain,” he said. “But they didn’t
kill everyone. And after they went away I got off towards Walton across
the fields. But—— It’s not sixteen days altogether—and your hair is
grey.” He looked over his shoulder suddenly. “Only a rook,” he said.
“One gets to know that birds have shadows these days. This is a bit
open. Let us crawl under those bushes and talk.”

“Have you seen any Martians?” I said. “Since I crawled out——”

“They’ve gone away across London,” he said. “I guess they’ve got a
bigger camp there. Of a night, all over there, Hampstead way, the sky
is alive with their lights. It’s like a great city, and in the glare
you can just see them moving. By daylight you can’t. But nearer—I
haven’t seen them—” (he counted on his fingers) “five days. Then I saw
a couple across Hammersmith way carrying something big. And the night
before last”—he stopped and spoke impressively—“it was just a matter of
lights, but it was something up in the air. I believe they’ve built a
flying-machine, and are learning to fly.”

I stopped, on hands and knees, for we had come to the bushes.

“Fly!”

“Yes,” he said, “fly.”

I went on into a little bower, and sat down.

“It is all over with humanity,” I said. “If they can do that they will
simply go round the world.”

He nodded.

“They will. But—— It will relieve things over here a bit. And
besides——” He looked at me. “Aren’t you satisfied it _is_ up with
humanity? I am. We’re down; we’re beat.”

I stared. Strange as it may seem, I had not arrived at this fact—a fact
perfectly obvious so soon as he spoke. I had still held a vague hope;
rather, I had kept a lifelong habit of mind. He repeated his words,
“We’re beat.” They carried absolute conviction.

“It’s all over,” he said. “They’ve lost _one_—just _one_. And they’ve
made their footing good and crippled the greatest power in the world.
They’ve walked over us. The death of that one at Weybridge was an
accident. And these are only pioneers. They kept on coming. These green
stars—I’ve seen none these five or six days, but I’ve no doubt they’re
falling somewhere every night. Nothing’s to be done. We’re under! We’re
beat!”

I made him no answer. I sat staring before me, trying in vain to devise
some countervailing thought.

“This isn’t a war,” said the artilleryman. “It never was a war, any
more than there’s war between man and ants.”

Suddenly I recalled the night in the observatory.

“After the tenth shot they fired no more—at least, until the first
cylinder came.”

“How do you know?” said the artilleryman. I explained. He thought.
“Something wrong with the gun,” he said. “But what if there is? They’ll
get it right again. And even if there’s a delay, how can it alter the
end? It’s just men and ants. There’s the ants builds their cities, live
their lives, have wars, revolutions, until the men want them out of the
way, and then they go out of the way. That’s what we are now—just ants.
Only——”

“Yes,” I said.

“We’re eatable ants.”

We sat looking at each other.

“And what will they do with us?” I said.

“That’s what I’ve been thinking,” he said; “that’s what I’ve been
thinking. After Weybridge I went south—thinking. I saw what was up.
Most of the people were hard at it squealing and exciting themselves.
But I’m not so fond of squealing. I’ve been in sight of death once or
twice; I’m not an ornamental soldier, and at the best and worst,
death—it’s just death. And it’s the man that keeps on thinking comes
through. I saw everyone tracking away south. Says I, ‘Food won’t last
this way,’ and I turned right back. I went for the Martians like a
sparrow goes for man. All round”—he waved a hand to the
horizon—“they’re starving in heaps, bolting, treading on each other. .
. .”

He saw my face, and halted awkwardly.

“No doubt lots who had money have gone away to France,” he said. He
seemed to hesitate whether to apologise, met my eyes, and went on:
“There’s food all about here. Canned things in shops; wines, spirits,
mineral waters; and the water mains and drains are empty. Well, I was
telling you what I was thinking. ‘Here’s intelligent things,’ I said,
‘and it seems they want us for food. First, they’ll smash us up—ships,
machines, guns, cities, all the order and organisation. All that will
go. If we were the size of ants we might pull through. But we’re not.
It’s all too bulky to stop. That’s the first certainty.’ Eh?”

I assented.

“It is; I’ve thought it out. Very well, then—next; at present we’re
caught as we’re wanted. A Martian has only to go a few miles to get a
crowd on the run. And I saw one, one day, out by Wandsworth, picking
houses to pieces and routing among the wreckage. But they won’t keep on
doing that. So soon as they’ve settled all our guns and ships, and
smashed our railways, and done all the things they are doing over
there, they will begin catching us systematic, picking the best and
storing us in cages and things. That’s what they will start doing in a
bit. Lord! They haven’t begun on us yet. Don’t you see that?”

“Not begun!” I exclaimed.

“Not begun. All that’s happened so far is through our not having the
sense to keep quiet—worrying them with guns and such foolery. And
losing our heads, and rushing off in crowds to where there wasn’t any
more safety than where we were. They don’t want to bother us yet.
They’re making their things—making all the things they couldn’t bring
with them, getting things ready for the rest of their people. Very
likely that’s why the cylinders have stopped for a bit, for fear of
hitting those who are here. And instead of our rushing about blind, on
the howl, or getting dynamite on the chance of busting them up, we’ve
got to fix ourselves up according to the new state of affairs. That’s
how I figure it out. It isn’t quite according to what a man wants for
his species, but it’s about what the facts point to. And that’s the
principle I acted upon. Cities, nations, civilisation, progress—it’s
all over. That game’s up. We’re beat.”

“But if that is so, what is there to live for?”

The artilleryman looked at me for a moment.

“There won’t be any more blessed concerts for a million years or so;
there won’t be any Royal Academy of Arts, and no nice little feeds at
restaurants. If it’s amusement you’re after, I reckon the game is up.
If you’ve got any drawing-room manners or a dislike to eating peas with
a knife or dropping aitches, you’d better chuck ’em away. They ain’t no
further use.”

“You mean——”

“I mean that men like me are going on living—for the sake of the breed.
I tell you, I’m grim set on living. And if I’m not mistaken, you’ll
show what insides _you’ve_ got, too, before long. We aren’t going to be
exterminated. And I don’t mean to be caught either, and tamed and
fattened and bred like a thundering ox. Ugh! Fancy those brown
creepers!”

“You don’t mean to say——”

“I do. I’m going on, under their feet. I’ve got it planned; I’ve
thought it out. We men are beat. We don’t know enough. We’ve got to
learn before we’ve got a chance. And we’ve got to live and keep
independent while we learn. See! That’s what has to be done.”

I stared, astonished, and stirred profoundly by the man’s resolution.

“Great God!” cried I. “But you are a man indeed!” And suddenly I
gripped his hand.

“Eh!” he said, with his eyes shining. “I’ve thought it out, eh?”

“Go on,” I said.

“Well, those who mean to escape their catching must get ready. I’m
getting ready. Mind you, it isn’t all of us that are made for wild
beasts; and that’s what it’s got to be. That’s why I watched you. I had
my doubts. You’re slender. I didn’t know that it was you, you see, or
just how you’d been buried. All these—the sort of people that lived in
these houses, and all those damn little clerks that used to live down
_that_ way—they’d be no good. They haven’t any spirit in them—no proud
dreams and no proud lusts; and a man who hasn’t one or the other—Lord!
What is he but funk and precautions? They just used to skedaddle off to
work—I’ve seen hundreds of ’em, bit of breakfast in hand, running wild
and shining to catch their little season-ticket train, for fear they’d
get dismissed if they didn’t; working at businesses they were afraid to
take the trouble to understand; skedaddling back for fear they wouldn’t
be in time for dinner; keeping indoors after dinner for fear of the
back streets, and sleeping with the wives they married, not because
they wanted them, but because they had a bit of money that would make
for safety in their one little miserable skedaddle through the world.
Lives insured and a bit invested for fear of accidents. And on
Sundays—fear of the hereafter. As if hell was built for rabbits! Well,
the Martians will just be a godsend to these. Nice roomy cages,
fattening food, careful breeding, no worry. After a week or so chasing
about the fields and lands on empty stomachs, they’ll come and be
caught cheerful. They’ll be quite glad after a bit. They’ll wonder what
people did before there were Martians to take care of them. And the bar
loafers, and mashers, and singers—I can imagine them. I can imagine
them,” he said, with a sort of sombre gratification. “There’ll be any
amount of sentiment and religion loose among them. There’s hundreds of
things I saw with my eyes that I’ve only begun to see clearly these
last few days. There’s lots will take things as they are—fat and
stupid; and lots will be worried by a sort of feeling that it’s all
wrong, and that they ought to be doing something. Now whenever things
are so that a lot of people feel they ought to be doing something, the
weak, and those who go weak with a lot of complicated thinking, always
make for a sort of do-nothing religion, very pious and superior, and
submit to persecution and the will of the Lord. Very likely you’ve seen
the same thing. It’s energy in a gale of funk, and turned clean inside
out. These cages will be full of psalms and hymns and piety. And those
of a less simple sort will work in a bit of—what is it?—eroticism.”

He paused.

“Very likely these Martians will make pets of some of them; train them
to do tricks—who knows?—get sentimental over the pet boy who grew up
and had to be killed. And some, maybe, they will train to hunt us.”

“No,” I cried, “that’s impossible! No human being——”

“What’s the good of going on with such lies?” said the artilleryman.
“There’s men who’d do it cheerful. What nonsense to pretend there
isn’t!”

And I succumbed to his conviction.

“If they come after me,” he said; “Lord, if they come after me!” and
subsided into a grim meditation.

I sat contemplating these things. I could find nothing to bring against
this man’s reasoning. In the days before the invasion no one would have
questioned my intellectual superiority to his—I, a professed and
recognised writer on philosophical themes, and he, a common soldier;
and yet he had already formulated a situation that I had scarcely
realised.

“What are you doing?” I said presently. “What plans have you made?”

He hesitated.

“Well, it’s like this,” he said. “What have we to do? We have to invent
a sort of life where men can live and breed, and be sufficiently secure
to bring the children up. Yes—wait a bit, and I’ll make it clearer what
I think ought to be done. The tame ones will go like all tame beasts;
in a few generations they’ll be big, beautiful, rich-blooded,
stupid—rubbish! The risk is that we who keep wild will go
savage—degenerate into a sort of big, savage rat. . . . You see, how I
mean to live is underground. I’ve been thinking about the drains. Of
course those who don’t know drains think horrible things; but under
this London are miles and miles—hundreds of miles—and a few days rain
and London empty will leave them sweet and clean. The main drains are
big enough and airy enough for anyone. Then there’s cellars, vaults,
stores, from which bolting passages may be made to the drains. And the
railway tunnels and subways. Eh? You begin to see? And we form a
band—able-bodied, clean-minded men. We’re not going to pick up any
rubbish that drifts in. Weaklings go out again.”

“As you meant me to go?”

“Well—I parleyed, didn’t I?”

“We won’t quarrel about that. Go on.”

“Those who stop obey orders. Able-bodied, clean-minded women we want
also—mothers and teachers. No lackadaisical ladies—no blasted rolling
eyes. We can’t have any weak or silly. Life is real again, and the
useless and cumbersome and mischievous have to die. They ought to die.
They ought to be willing to die. It’s a sort of disloyalty, after all,
to live and taint the race. And they can’t be happy. Moreover, dying’s
none so dreadful; it’s the funking makes it bad. And in all those
places we shall gather. Our district will be London. And we may even be
able to keep a watch, and run about in the open when the Martians keep
away. Play cricket, perhaps. That’s how we shall save the race. Eh?
It’s a possible thing? But saving the race is nothing in itself. As I
say, that’s only being rats. It’s saving our knowledge and adding to it
is the thing. There men like you come in. There’s books, there’s
models. We must make great safe places down deep, and get all the books
we can; not novels and poetry swipes, but ideas, science books. That’s
where men like you come in. We must go to the British Museum and pick
all those books through. Especially we must keep up our science—learn
more. We must watch these Martians. Some of us must go as spies. When
it’s all working, perhaps I will. Get caught, I mean. And the great
thing is, we must leave the Martians alone. We mustn’t even steal. If
we get in their way, we clear out. We must show them we mean no harm.
Yes, I know. But they’re intelligent things, and they won’t hunt us
down if they have all they want, and think we’re just harmless vermin.”

The artilleryman paused and laid a brown hand upon my arm.

“After all, it may not be so much we may have to learn before—Just
imagine this: four or five of their fighting machines suddenly starting
off—Heat-Rays right and left, and not a Martian in ’em. Not a Martian
in ’em, but men—men who have learned the way how. It may be in my time,
even—those men. Fancy having one of them lovely things, with its
Heat-Ray wide and free! Fancy having it in control! What would it
matter if you smashed to smithereens at the end of the run, after a
bust like that? I reckon the Martians’ll open their beautiful eyes!
Can’t you see them, man? Can’t you see them hurrying, hurrying—puffing
and blowing and hooting to their other mechanical affairs? Something
out of gear in every case. And swish, bang, rattle, swish! Just as they
are fumbling over it, _swish_ comes the Heat-Ray, and, behold! man has
come back to his own.”

For a while the imaginative daring of the artilleryman, and the tone of
assurance and courage he assumed, completely dominated my mind. I
believed unhesitatingly both in his forecast of human destiny and in
the practicability of his astonishing scheme, and the reader who thinks
me susceptible and foolish must contrast his position, reading steadily
with all his thoughts about his subject, and mine, crouching fearfully
in the bushes and listening, distracted by apprehension. We talked in
this manner through the early morning time, and later crept out of the
bushes, and, after scanning the sky for Martians, hurried precipitately
to the house on Putney Hill where he had made his lair. It was the coal
cellar of the place, and when I saw the work he had spent a week
upon—it was a burrow scarcely ten yards long, which he designed to
reach to the main drain on Putney Hill—I had my first inkling of the
gulf between his dreams and his powers. Such a hole I could have dug in
a day. But I believed in him sufficiently to work with him all that
morning until past midday at his digging. We had a garden barrow and
shot the earth we removed against the kitchen range. We refreshed
ourselves with a tin of mock-turtle soup and wine from the neighbouring
pantry. I found a curious relief from the aching strangeness of the
world in this steady labour. As we worked, I turned his project over in
my mind, and presently objections and doubts began to arise; but I
worked there all the morning, so glad was I to find myself with a
purpose again. After working an hour I began to speculate on the
distance one had to go before the cloaca was reached, the chances we
had of missing it altogether. My immediate trouble was why we should
dig this long tunnel, when it was possible to get into the drain at
once down one of the manholes, and work back to the house. It seemed to
me, too, that the house was inconveniently chosen, and required a
needless length of tunnel. And just as I was beginning to face these
things, the artilleryman stopped digging, and looked at me.

“We’re working well,” he said. He put down his spade. “Let us knock off
a bit” he said. “I think it’s time we reconnoitred from the roof of the
house.”

I was for going on, and after a little hesitation he resumed his spade;
and then suddenly I was struck by a thought. I stopped, and so did he
at once.

“Why were you walking about the common,” I said, “instead of being
here?”

“Taking the air,” he said. “I was coming back. It’s safer by night.”

“But the work?”

“Oh, one can’t always work,” he said, and in a flash I saw the man
plain. He hesitated, holding his spade. “We ought to reconnoitre now,”
he said, “because if any come near they may hear the spades and drop
upon us unawares.”

I was no longer disposed to object. We went together to the roof and
stood on a ladder peeping out of the roof door. No Martians were to be
seen, and we ventured out on the tiles, and slipped down under shelter
of the parapet.

From this position a shrubbery hid the greater portion of Putney, but
we could see the river below, a bubbly mass of red weed, and the low
parts of Lambeth flooded and red. The red creeper swarmed up the trees
about the old palace, and their branches stretched gaunt and dead, and
set with shrivelled leaves, from amid its clusters. It was strange how
entirely dependent both these things were upon flowing water for their
propagation. About us neither had gained a footing; laburnums, pink
mays, snowballs, and trees of arbor-vitae, rose out of laurels and
hydrangeas, green and brilliant into the sunlight. Beyond Kensington
dense smoke was rising, and that and a blue haze hid the northward
hills.

The artilleryman began to tell me of the sort of people who still
remained in London.

“One night last week,” he said, “some fools got the electric light in
order, and there was all Regent Street and the Circus ablaze, crowded
with painted and ragged drunkards, men and women, dancing and shouting
till dawn. A man who was there told me. And as the day came they became
aware of a fighting-machine standing near by the Langham and looking
down at them. Heaven knows how long he had been there. It must have
given some of them a nasty turn. He came down the road towards them,
and picked up nearly a hundred too drunk or frightened to run away.”

Grotesque gleam of a time no history will ever fully describe!

From that, in answer to my questions, he came round to his grandiose
plans again. He grew enthusiastic. He talked so eloquently of the
possibility of capturing a fighting-machine that I more than half
believed in him again. But now that I was beginning to understand
something of his quality, I could divine the stress he laid on doing
nothing precipitately. And I noted that now there was no question that
he personally was to capture and fight the great machine.

After a time we went down to the cellar. Neither of us seemed disposed
to resume digging, and when he suggested a meal, I was nothing loath.
He became suddenly very generous, and when we had eaten he went away
and returned with some excellent cigars. We lit these, and his optimism
glowed. He was inclined to regard my coming as a great occasion.

“There’s some champagne in the cellar,” he said.

“We can dig better on this Thames-side burgundy,” said I.

“No,” said he; “I am host today. Champagne! Great God! We’ve a heavy
enough task before us! Let us take a rest and gather strength while we
may. Look at these blistered hands!”

And pursuant to this idea of a holiday, he insisted upon playing cards
after we had eaten. He taught me euchre, and after dividing London
between us, I taking the northern side and he the southern, we played
for parish points. Grotesque and foolish as this will seem to the sober
reader, it is absolutely true, and what is more remarkable, I found the
card game and several others we played extremely interesting.

Strange mind of man! that, with our species upon the edge of
extermination or appalling degradation, with no clear prospect before
us but the chance of a horrible death, we could sit following the
chance of this painted pasteboard, and playing the “joker” with vivid
delight. Afterwards he taught me poker, and I beat him at three tough
chess games. When dark came we decided to take the risk, and lit a
lamp.

After an interminable string of games, we supped, and the artilleryman
finished the champagne. We went on smoking the cigars. He was no longer
the energetic regenerator of his species I had encountered in the
morning. He was still optimistic, but it was a less kinetic, a more
thoughtful optimism. I remember he wound up with my health, proposed in
a speech of small variety and considerable intermittence. I took a
cigar, and went upstairs to look at the lights of which he had spoken
that blazed so greenly along the Highgate hills.

At first I stared unintelligently across the London valley. The
northern hills were shrouded in darkness; the fires near Kensington
glowed redly, and now and then an orange-red tongue of flame flashed up
and vanished in the deep blue night. All the rest of London was black.
Then, nearer, I perceived a strange light, a pale, violet-purple
fluorescent glow, quivering under the night breeze. For a space I could
not understand it, and then I knew that it must be the red weed from
which this faint irradiation proceeded. With that realisation my
dormant sense of wonder, my sense of the proportion of things, awoke
again. I glanced from that to Mars, red and clear, glowing high in the
west, and then gazed long and earnestly at the darkness of Hampstead
and Highgate.

I remained a very long time upon the roof, wondering at the grotesque
changes of the day. I recalled my mental states from the midnight
prayer to the foolish card-playing. I had a violent revulsion of
feeling. I remember I flung away the cigar with a certain wasteful
symbolism. My folly came to me with glaring exaggeration. I seemed a
traitor to my wife and to my kind; I was filled with remorse. I
resolved to leave this strange undisciplined dreamer of great things to
his drink and gluttony, and to go on into London. There, it seemed to
me, I had the best chance of learning what the Martians and my
fellowmen were doing. I was still upon the roof when the late moon
rose.




VIII.
DEAD LONDON.


After I had parted from the artilleryman, I went down the hill, and by
the High Street across the bridge to Fulham. The red weed was
tumultuous at that time, and nearly choked the bridge roadway; but its
fronds were already whitened in patches by the spreading disease that
presently removed it so swiftly.

At the corner of the lane that runs to Putney Bridge station I found a
man lying. He was as black as a sweep with the black dust, alive, but
helplessly and speechlessly drunk. I could get nothing from him but
curses and furious lunges at my head. I think I should have stayed by
him but for the brutal expression of his face.

There was black dust along the roadway from the bridge onwards, and it
grew thicker in Fulham. The streets were horribly quiet. I got
food—sour, hard, and mouldy, but quite eatable—in a baker’s shop here.
Some way towards Walham Green the streets became clear of powder, and I
passed a white terrace of houses on fire; the noise of the burning was
an absolute relief. Going on towards Brompton, the streets were quiet
again.

Here I came once more upon the black powder in the streets and upon
dead bodies. I saw altogether about a dozen in the length of the Fulham
Road. They had been dead many days, so that I hurried quickly past
them. The black powder covered them over, and softened their outlines.
One or two had been disturbed by dogs.

Where there was no black powder, it was curiously like a Sunday in the
City, with the closed shops, the houses locked up and the blinds drawn,
the desertion, and the stillness. In some places plunderers had been at
work, but rarely at other than the provision and wine shops. A
jeweller’s window had been broken open in one place, but apparently the
thief had been disturbed, and a number of gold chains and a watch lay
scattered on the pavement. I did not trouble to touch them. Farther on
was a tattered woman in a heap on a doorstep; the hand that hung over
her knee was gashed and bled down her rusty brown dress, and a smashed
magnum of champagne formed a pool across the pavement. She seemed
asleep, but she was dead.

The farther I penetrated into London, the profounder grew the
stillness. But it was not so much the stillness of death—it was the
stillness of suspense, of expectation. At any time the destruction that
had already singed the northwestern borders of the metropolis, and had
annihilated Ealing and Kilburn, might strike among these houses and
leave them smoking ruins. It was a city condemned and derelict. . . .

In South Kensington the streets were clear of dead and of black powder.
It was near South Kensington that I first heard the howling. It crept
almost imperceptibly upon my senses. It was a sobbing alternation of
two notes, “Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” keeping on perpetually. When I
passed streets that ran northward it grew in volume, and houses and
buildings seemed to deaden and cut it off again. It came in a full tide
down Exhibition Road. I stopped, staring towards Kensington Gardens,
wondering at this strange, remote wailing. It was as if that mighty
desert of houses had found a voice for its fear and solitude.

“Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” wailed that superhuman note—great waves of
sound sweeping down the broad, sunlit roadway, between the tall
buildings on each side. I turned northwards, marvelling, towards the
iron gates of Hyde Park. I had half a mind to break into the Natural
History Museum and find my way up to the summits of the towers, in
order to see across the park. But I decided to keep to the ground,
where quick hiding was possible, and so went on up the Exhibition Road.
All the large mansions on each side of the road were empty and still,
and my footsteps echoed against the sides of the houses. At the top,
near the park gate, I came upon a strange sight—a bus overturned, and
the skeleton of a horse picked clean. I puzzled over this for a time,
and then went on to the bridge over the Serpentine. The voice grew
stronger and stronger, though I could see nothing above the housetops
on the north side of the park, save a haze of smoke to the northwest.

“Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” cried the voice, coming, as it seemed to me,
from the district about Regent’s Park. The desolating cry worked upon
my mind. The mood that had sustained me passed. The wailing took
possession of me. I found I was intensely weary, footsore, and now
again hungry and thirsty.

It was already past noon. Why was I wandering alone in this city of the
dead? Why was I alone when all London was lying in state, and in its
black shroud? I felt intolerably lonely. My mind ran on old friends
that I had forgotten for years. I thought of the poisons in the
chemists’ shops, of the liquors the wine merchants stored; I recalled
the two sodden creatures of despair, who so far as I knew, shared the
city with myself. . . .

I came into Oxford Street by the Marble Arch, and here again were black
powder and several bodies, and an evil, ominous smell from the gratings
of the cellars of some of the houses. I grew very thirsty after the
heat of my long walk. With infinite trouble I managed to break into a
public-house and get food and drink. I was weary after eating, and went
into the parlour behind the bar, and slept on a black horsehair sofa I
found there.

I awoke to find that dismal howling still in my ears, “Ulla, ulla,
ulla, ulla.” It was now dusk, and after I had routed out some biscuits
and a cheese in the bar—there was a meat safe, but it contained nothing
but maggots—I wandered on through the silent residential squares to
Baker Street—Portman Square is the only one I can name—and so came out
at last upon Regent’s Park. And as I emerged from the top of Baker
Street, I saw far away over the trees in the clearness of the sunset
the hood of the Martian giant from which this howling proceeded. I was
not terrified. I came upon him as if it were a matter of course. I
watched him for some time, but he did not move. He appeared to be
standing and yelling, for no reason that I could discover.

I tried to formulate a plan of action. That perpetual sound of “Ulla,
ulla, ulla, ulla,” confused my mind. Perhaps I was too tired to be very
fearful. Certainly I was more curious to know the reason of this
monotonous crying than afraid. I turned back away from the park and
struck into Park Road, intending to skirt the park, went along under
the shelter of the terraces, and got a view of this stationary, howling
Martian from the direction of St. John’s Wood. A couple of hundred
yards out of Baker Street I heard a yelping chorus, and saw, first a
dog with a piece of putrescent red meat in his jaws coming headlong
towards me, and then a pack of starving mongrels in pursuit of him. He
made a wide curve to avoid me, as though he feared I might prove a
fresh competitor. As the yelping died away down the silent road, the
wailing sound of “Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” reasserted itself.

I came upon the wrecked handling-machine halfway to St. John’s Wood
station. At first I thought a house had fallen across the road. It was
only as I clambered among the ruins that I saw, with a start, this
mechanical Samson lying, with its tentacles bent and smashed and
twisted, among the ruins it had made. The forepart was shattered. It
seemed as if it had driven blindly straight at the house, and had been
overwhelmed in its overthrow. It seemed to me then that this might have
happened by a handling-machine escaping from the guidance of its
Martian. I could not clamber among the ruins to see it, and the
twilight was now so far advanced that the blood with which its seat was
smeared, and the gnawed gristle of the Martian that the dogs had left,
were invisible to me.

Wondering still more at all that I had seen, I pushed on towards
Primrose Hill. Far away, through a gap in the trees, I saw a second
Martian, as motionless as the first, standing in the park towards the
Zoological Gardens, and silent. A little beyond the ruins about the
smashed handling-machine I came upon the red weed again, and found the
Regent’s Canal, a spongy mass of dark-red vegetation.

As I crossed the bridge, the sound of “Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” ceased.
It was, as it were, cut off. The silence came like a thunderclap.

The dusky houses about me stood faint and tall and dim; the trees
towards the park were growing black. All about me the red weed
clambered among the ruins, writhing to get above me in the dimness.
Night, the mother of fear and mystery, was coming upon me. But while
that voice sounded the solitude, the desolation, had been endurable; by
virtue of it London had still seemed alive, and the sense of life about
me had upheld me. Then suddenly a change, the passing of something—I
knew not what—and then a stillness that could be felt. Nothing but this
gaunt quiet.

London about me gazed at me spectrally. The windows in the white houses
were like the eye sockets of skulls. About me my imagination found a
thousand noiseless enemies moving. Terror seized me, a horror of my
temerity. In front of me the road became pitchy black as though it was
tarred, and I saw a contorted shape lying across the pathway. I could
not bring myself to go on. I turned down St. John’s Wood Road, and ran
headlong from this unendurable stillness towards Kilburn. I hid from
the night and the silence, until long after midnight, in a cabmen’s
shelter in Harrow Road. But before the dawn my courage returned, and
while the stars were still in the sky I turned once more towards
Regent’s Park. I missed my way among the streets, and presently saw
down a long avenue, in the half-light of the early dawn, the curve of
Primrose Hill. On the summit, towering up to the fading stars, was a
third Martian, erect and motionless like the others.

An insane resolve possessed me. I would die and end it. And I would
save myself even the trouble of killing myself. I marched on recklessly
towards this Titan, and then, as I drew nearer and the light grew, I
saw that a multitude of black birds was circling and clustering about
the hood. At that my heart gave a bound, and I began running along the
road.

I hurried through the red weed that choked St. Edmund’s Terrace (I
waded breast-high across a torrent of water that was rushing down from
the waterworks towards the Albert Road), and emerged upon the grass
before the rising of the sun. Great mounds had been heaped about the
crest of the hill, making a huge redoubt of it—it was the final and
largest place the Martians had made—and from behind these heaps there
rose a thin smoke against the sky. Against the sky line an eager dog
ran and disappeared. The thought that had flashed into my mind grew
real, grew credible. I felt no fear, only a wild, trembling exultation,
as I ran up the hill towards the motionless monster. Out of the hood
hung lank shreds of brown, at which the hungry birds pecked and tore.

In another moment I had scrambled up the earthen rampart and stood upon
its crest, and the interior of the redoubt was below me. A mighty space
it was, with gigantic machines here and there within it, huge mounds of
material and strange shelter places. And scattered about it, some in
their overturned war-machines, some in the now rigid handling-machines,
and a dozen of them stark and silent and laid in a row, were the
Martians—_dead_!—slain by the putrefactive and disease bacteria against
which their systems were unprepared; slain as the red weed was being
slain; slain, after all man’s devices had failed, by the humblest
things that God, in his wisdom, has put upon this earth.

For so it had come about, as indeed I and many men might have foreseen
had not terror and disaster blinded our minds. These germs of disease
have taken toll of humanity since the beginning of things—taken toll of
our prehuman ancestors since life began here. But by virtue of this
natural selection of our kind we have developed resisting power; to no
germs do we succumb without a struggle, and to many—those that cause
putrefaction in dead matter, for instance—our living frames are
altogether immune. But there are no bacteria in Mars, and directly
these invaders arrived, directly they drank and fed, our microscopic
allies began to work their overthrow. Already when I watched them they
were irrevocably doomed, dying and rotting even as they went to and
fro. It was inevitable. By the toll of a billion deaths man has bought
his birthright of the earth, and it is his against all comers; it would
still be his were the Martians ten times as mighty as they are. For
neither do men live nor die in vain.

Here and there they were scattered, nearly fifty altogether, in that
great gulf they had made, overtaken by a death that must have seemed to
them as incomprehensible as any death could be. To me also at that time
this death was incomprehensible. All I knew was that these things that
had been alive and so terrible to men were dead. For a moment I
believed that the destruction of Sennacherib had been repeated, that
God had repented, that the Angel of Death had slain them in the night.

I stood staring into the pit, and my heart lightened gloriously, even
as the rising sun struck the world to fire about me with his rays. The
pit was still in darkness; the mighty engines, so great and wonderful
in their power and complexity, so unearthly in their tortuous forms,
rose weird and vague and strange out of the shadows towards the light.
A multitude of dogs, I could hear, fought over the bodies that lay
darkly in the depth of the pit, far below me. Across the pit on its
farther lip, flat and vast and strange, lay the great flying-machine
with which they had been experimenting upon our denser atmosphere when
decay and death arrested them. Death had come not a day too soon. At
the sound of a cawing overhead I looked up at the huge fighting-machine
that would fight no more for ever, at the tattered red shreds of flesh
that dripped down upon the overturned seats on the summit of Primrose
Hill.

I turned and looked down the slope of the hill to where, enhaloed now
in birds, stood those other two Martians that I had seen overnight,
just as death had overtaken them. The one had died, even as it had been
crying to its companions; perhaps it was the last to die, and its voice
had gone on perpetually until the force of its machinery was exhausted.
They glittered now, harmless tripod towers of shining metal, in the
brightness of the rising sun.

All about the pit, and saved as by a miracle from everlasting
destruction, stretched the great Mother of Cities. Those who have only
seen London veiled in her sombre robes of smoke can scarcely imagine
the naked clearness and beauty of the silent wilderness of houses.

Eastward, over the blackened ruins of the Albert Terrace and the
splintered spire of the church, the sun blazed dazzling in a clear sky,
and here and there some facet in the great wilderness of roofs caught
the light and glared with a white intensity.

Northward were Kilburn and Hampsted, blue and crowded with houses;
westward the great city was dimmed; and southward, beyond the Martians,
the green waves of Regent’s Park, the Langham Hotel, the dome of the
Albert Hall, the Imperial Institute, and the giant mansions of the
Brompton Road came out clear and little in the sunrise, the jagged
ruins of Westminster rising hazily beyond. Far away and blue were the
Surrey hills, and the towers of the Crystal Palace glittered like two
silver rods. The dome of St. Paul’s was dark against the sunrise, and
injured, I saw for the first time, by a huge gaping cavity on its
western side.

And as I looked at this wide expanse of houses and factories and
churches, silent and abandoned; as I thought of the multitudinous hopes
and efforts, the innumerable hosts of lives that had gone to build this
human reef, and of the swift and ruthless destruction that had hung
over it all; when I realised that the shadow had been rolled back, and
that men might still live in the streets, and this dear vast dead city
of mine be once more alive and powerful, I felt a wave of emotion that
was near akin to tears.

The torment was over. Even that day the healing would begin. The
survivors of the people scattered over the country—leaderless, lawless,
foodless, like sheep without a shepherd—the thousands who had fled by
sea, would begin to return; the pulse of life, growing stronger and
stronger, would beat again in the empty streets and pour across the
vacant squares. Whatever destruction was done, the hand of the
destroyer was stayed. All the gaunt wrecks, the blackened skeletons of
houses that stared so dismally at the sunlit grass of the hill, would
presently be echoing with the hammers of the restorers and ringing with
the tapping of their trowels. At the thought I extended my hands
towards the sky and began thanking God. In a year, thought I—in a year.
. . .

With overwhelming force came the thought of myself, of my wife, and the
old life of hope and tender helpfulness that had ceased for ever.




IX.
WRECKAGE.


And now comes the strangest thing in my story. Yet, perhaps, it is not
altogether strange. I remember, clearly and coldly and vividly, all
that I did that day until the time that I stood weeping and praising
God upon the summit of Primrose Hill. And then I forget.

Of the next three days I know nothing. I have learned since that, so
far from my being the first discoverer of the Martian overthrow,
several such wanderers as myself had already discovered this on the
previous night. One man—the first—had gone to St. Martin’s-le-Grand,
and, while I sheltered in the cabmen’s hut, had contrived to telegraph
to Paris. Thence the joyful news had flashed all over the world; a
thousand cities, chilled by ghastly apprehensions, suddenly flashed
into frantic illuminations; they knew of it in Dublin, Edinburgh,
Manchester, Birmingham, at the time when I stood upon the verge of the
pit. Already men, weeping with joy, as I have heard, shouting and
staying their work to shake hands and shout, were making up trains,
even as near as Crewe, to descend upon London. The church bells that
had ceased a fortnight since suddenly caught the news, until all
England was bell-ringing. Men on cycles, lean-faced, unkempt, scorched
along every country lane shouting of unhoped deliverance, shouting to
gaunt, staring figures of despair. And for the food! Across the
Channel, across the Irish Sea, across the Atlantic, corn, bread, and
meat were tearing to our relief. All the shipping in the world seemed
going Londonward in those days. But of all this I have no memory. I
drifted—a demented man. I found myself in a house of kindly people, who
had found me on the third day wandering, weeping, and raving through
the streets of St. John’s Wood. They have told me since that I was
singing some insane doggerel about “The Last Man Left Alive! Hurrah!
The Last Man Left Alive!” Troubled as they were with their own affairs,
these people, whose name, much as I would like to express my gratitude
to them, I may not even give here, nevertheless cumbered themselves
with me, sheltered me, and protected me from myself. Apparently they
had learned something of my story from me during the days of my lapse.

Very gently, when my mind was assured again, did they break to me what
they had learned of the fate of Leatherhead. Two days after I was
imprisoned it had been destroyed, with every soul in it, by a Martian.
He had swept it out of existence, as it seemed, without any
provocation, as a boy might crush an ant hill, in the mere wantonness
of power.

I was a lonely man, and they were very kind to me. I was a lonely man
and a sad one, and they bore with me. I remained with them four days
after my recovery. All that time I felt a vague, a growing craving to
look once more on whatever remained of the little life that seemed so
happy and bright in my past. It was a mere hopeless desire to feast
upon my misery. They dissuaded me. They did all they could to divert me
from this morbidity. But at last I could resist the impulse no longer,
and, promising faithfully to return to them, and parting, as I will
confess, from these four-day friends with tears, I went out again into
the streets that had lately been so dark and strange and empty.

Already they were busy with returning people; in places even there were
shops open, and I saw a drinking fountain running water.

I remember how mockingly bright the day seemed as I went back on my
melancholy pilgrimage to the little house at Woking, how busy the
streets and vivid the moving life about me. So many people were abroad
everywhere, busied in a thousand activities, that it seemed incredible
that any great proportion of the population could have been slain. But
then I noticed how yellow were the skins of the people I met, how
shaggy the hair of the men, how large and bright their eyes, and that
every other man still wore his dirty rags. Their faces seemed all with
one of two expressions—a leaping exultation and energy or a grim
resolution. Save for the expression of the faces, London seemed a city
of tramps. The vestries were indiscriminately distributing bread sent
us by the French government. The ribs of the few horses showed
dismally. Haggard special constables with white badges stood at the
corners of every street. I saw little of the mischief wrought by the
Martians until I reached Wellington Street, and there I saw the red
weed clambering over the buttresses of Waterloo Bridge.

At the corner of the bridge, too, I saw one of the common contrasts of
that grotesque time—a sheet of paper flaunting against a thicket of the
red weed, transfixed by a stick that kept it in place. It was the
placard of the first newspaper to resume publication—the _Daily Mail_.
I bought a copy for a blackened shilling I found in my pocket. Most of
it was in blank, but the solitary compositor who did the thing had
amused himself by making a grotesque scheme of advertisement stereo on
the back page. The matter he printed was emotional; the news
organisation had not as yet found its way back. I learned nothing fresh
except that already in one week the examination of the Martian
mechanisms had yielded astonishing results. Among other things, the
article assured me what I did not believe at the time, that the “Secret
of Flying,” was discovered. At Waterloo I found the free trains that
were taking people to their homes. The first rush was already over.
There were few people in the train, and I was in no mood for casual
conversation. I got a compartment to myself, and sat with folded arms,
looking greyly at the sunlit devastation that flowed past the windows.
And just outside the terminus the train jolted over temporary rails,
and on either side of the railway the houses were blackened ruins. To
Clapham Junction the face of London was grimy with powder of the Black
Smoke, in spite of two days of thunderstorms and rain, and at Clapham
Junction the line had been wrecked again; there were hundreds of
out-of-work clerks and shopmen working side by side with the customary
navvies, and we were jolted over a hasty relaying.

All down the line from there the aspect of the country was gaunt and
unfamiliar; Wimbledon particularly had suffered. Walton, by virtue of
its unburned pine woods, seemed the least hurt of any place along the
line. The Wandle, the Mole, every little stream, was a heaped mass of
red weed, in appearance between butcher’s meat and pickled cabbage. The
Surrey pine woods were too dry, however, for the festoons of the red
climber. Beyond Wimbledon, within sight of the line, in certain nursery
grounds, were the heaped masses of earth about the sixth cylinder. A
number of people were standing about it, and some sappers were busy in
the midst of it. Over it flaunted a Union Jack, flapping cheerfully in
the morning breeze. The nursery grounds were everywhere crimson with
the weed, a wide expanse of livid colour cut with purple shadows, and
very painful to the eye. One’s gaze went with infinite relief from the
scorched greys and sullen reds of the foreground to the blue-green
softness of the eastward hills.

The line on the London side of Woking station was still undergoing
repair, so I descended at Byfleet station and took the road to Maybury,
past the place where I and the artilleryman had talked to the hussars,
and on by the spot where the Martian had appeared to me in the
thunderstorm. Here, moved by curiosity, I turned aside to find, among a
tangle of red fronds, the warped and broken dog cart with the whitened
bones of the horse scattered and gnawed. For a time I stood regarding
these vestiges. . . .

Then I returned through the pine wood, neck-high with red weed here and
there, to find the landlord of the Spotted Dog had already found
burial, and so came home past the College Arms. A man standing at an
open cottage door greeted me by name as I passed.

I looked at my house with a quick flash of hope that faded immediately.
The door had been forced; it was unfast and was opening slowly as I
approached.

It slammed again. The curtains of my study fluttered out of the open
window from which I and the artilleryman had watched the dawn. No one
had closed it since. The smashed bushes were just as I had left them
nearly four weeks ago. I stumbled into the hall, and the house felt
empty. The stair carpet was ruffled and discoloured where I had
crouched, soaked to the skin from the thunderstorm the night of the
catastrophe. Our muddy footsteps I saw still went up the stairs.

I followed them to my study, and found lying on my writing-table still,
with the selenite paper weight upon it, the sheet of work I had left on
the afternoon of the opening of the cylinder. For a space I stood
reading over my abandoned arguments. It was a paper on the probable
development of Moral Ideas with the development of the civilising
process; and the last sentence was the opening of a prophecy: “In about
two hundred years,” I had written, “we may expect——” The sentence ended
abruptly. I remembered my inability to fix my mind that morning,
scarcely a month gone by, and how I had broken off to get my _Daily
Chronicle_ from the newsboy. I remembered how I went down to the garden
gate as he came along, and how I had listened to his odd story of “Men
from Mars.”

I came down and went into the dining room. There were the mutton and
the bread, both far gone now in decay, and a beer bottle overturned,
just as I and the artilleryman had left them. My home was desolate. I
perceived the folly of the faint hope I had cherished so long. And then
a strange thing occurred. “It is no use,” said a voice. “The house is
deserted. No one has been here these ten days. Do not stay here to
torment yourself. No one escaped but you.”

I was startled. Had I spoken my thought aloud? I turned, and the French
window was open behind me. I made a step to it, and stood looking out.

And there, amazed and afraid, even as I stood amazed and afraid, were
my cousin and my wife—my wife white and tearless. She gave a faint cry.

“I came,” she said. “I knew—knew——”

She put her hand to her throat—swayed. I made a step forward, and
caught her in my arms.




X.
THE EPILOGUE.


I cannot but regret, now that I am concluding my story, how little I am
able to contribute to the discussion of the many debatable questions
which are still unsettled. In one respect I shall certainly provoke
criticism. My particular province is speculative philosophy. My
knowledge of comparative physiology is confined to a book or two, but
it seems to me that Carver’s suggestions as to the reason of the rapid
death of the Martians is so probable as to be regarded almost as a
proven conclusion. I have assumed that in the body of my narrative.

At any rate, in all the bodies of the Martians that were examined after
the war, no bacteria except those already known as terrestrial species
were found. That they did not bury any of their dead, and the reckless
slaughter they perpetrated, point also to an entire ignorance of the
putrefactive process. But probable as this seems, it is by no means a
proven conclusion.

Neither is the composition of the Black Smoke known, which the Martians
used with such deadly effect, and the generator of the Heat-Rays
remains a puzzle. The terrible disasters at the Ealing and South
Kensington laboratories have disinclined analysts for further
investigations upon the latter. Spectrum analysis of the black powder
points unmistakably to the presence of an unknown element with a
brilliant group of three lines in the green, and it is possible that it
combines with argon to form a compound which acts at once with deadly
effect upon some constituent in the blood. But such unproven
speculations will scarcely be of interest to the general reader, to
whom this story is addressed. None of the brown scum that drifted down
the Thames after the destruction of Shepperton was examined at the
time, and now none is forthcoming.

The results of an anatomical examination of the Martians, so far as the
prowling dogs had left such an examination possible, I have already
given. But everyone is familiar with the magnificent and almost
complete specimen in spirits at the Natural History Museum, and the
countless drawings that have been made from it; and beyond that the
interest of their physiology and structure is purely scientific.

A question of graver and universal interest is the possibility of
another attack from the Martians. I do not think that nearly enough
attention is being given to this aspect of the matter. At present the
planet Mars is in conjunction, but with every return to opposition I,
for one, anticipate a renewal of their adventure. In any case, we
should be prepared. It seems to me that it should be possible to define
the position of the gun from which the shots are discharged, to keep a
sustained watch upon this part of the planet, and to anticipate the
arrival of the next attack.

In that case the cylinder might be destroyed with dynamite or artillery
before it was sufficiently cool for the Martians to emerge, or they
might be butchered by means of guns so soon as the screw opened. It
seems to me that they have lost a vast advantage in the failure of
their first surprise. Possibly they see it in the same light.

Lessing has advanced excellent reasons for supposing that the Martians
have actually succeeded in effecting a landing on the planet Venus.
Seven months ago now, Venus and Mars were in alignment with the sun;
that is to say, Mars was in opposition from the point of view of an
observer on Venus. Subsequently a peculiar luminous and sinuous marking
appeared on the unillumined half of the inner planet, and almost
simultaneously a faint dark mark of a similar sinuous character was
detected upon a photograph of the Martian disk. One needs to see the
drawings of these appearances in order to appreciate fully their
remarkable resemblance in character.

At any rate, whether we expect another invasion or not, our views of
the human future must be greatly modified by these events. We have
learned now that we cannot regard this planet as being fenced in and a
secure abiding place for Man; we can never anticipate the unseen good
or evil that may come upon us suddenly out of space. It may be that in
the larger design of the universe this invasion from Mars is not
without its ultimate benefit for men; it has robbed us of that serene
confidence in the future which is the most fruitful source of
decadence, the gifts to human science it has brought are enormous, and
it has done much to promote the conception of the commonweal of
mankind. It may be that across the immensity of space the Martians have
watched the fate of these pioneers of theirs and learned their lesson,
and that on the planet Venus they have found a securer settlement. Be
that as it may, for many years yet there will certainly be no
relaxation of the eager scrutiny of the Martian disk, and those fiery
darts of the sky, the shooting stars, will bring with them as they fall
an unavoidable apprehension to all the sons of men.

The broadening of men’s views that has resulted can scarcely be
exaggerated. Before the cylinder fell there was a general persuasion
that through all the deep of space no life existed beyond the petty
surface of our minute sphere. Now we see further. If the Martians can
reach Venus, there is no reason to suppose that the thing is impossible
for men, and when the slow cooling of the sun makes this earth
uninhabitable, as at last it must do, it may be that the thread of life
that has begun here will have streamed out and caught our sister planet
within its toils.

Dim and wonderful is the vision I have conjured up in my mind of life
spreading slowly from this little seed bed of the solar system
throughout the inanimate vastness of sidereal space. But that is a
remote dream. It may be, on the other hand, that the destruction of the
Martians is only a reprieve. To them, and not to us, perhaps, is the
future ordained.

I must confess the stress and danger of the time have left an abiding
sense of doubt and insecurity in my mind. I sit in my study writing by
lamplight, and suddenly I see again the healing valley below set with
writhing flames, and feel the house behind and about me empty and
desolate. I go out into the Byfleet Road, and vehicles pass me, a
butcher boy in a cart, a cabful of visitors, a workman on a bicycle,
children going to school, and suddenly they become vague and unreal,
and I hurry again with the artilleryman through the hot, brooding
silence. Of a night I see the black powder darkening the silent
streets, and the contorted bodies shrouded in that layer; they rise
upon me tattered and dog-bitten. They gibber and grow fiercer, paler,
uglier, mad distortions of humanity at last, and I wake, cold and
wretched, in the darkness of the night.

I go to London and see the busy multitudes in Fleet Street and the
Strand, and it comes across my mind that they are but the ghosts of the
past, haunting the streets that I have seen silent and wretched, going
to and fro, phantasms in a dead city, the mockery of life in a
galvanised body. And strange, too, it is to stand on Primrose Hill, as
I did but a day before writing this last chapter, to see the great
province of houses, dim and blue through the haze of the smoke and
mist, vanishing at last into the vague lower sky, to see the people
walking to and fro among the flower beds on the hill, to see the
sight-seers about the Martian machine that stands there still, to hear
the tumult of playing children, and to recall the time when I saw it
all bright and clear-cut, hard and silent, under the dawn of that last
great day. . . .

And strangest of all is it to hold my wife’s hand again, and to think
that I have counted her, and that she has counted me, among the dead.

CHAPTER I.
THE STRANGE MAN’S ARRIVAL


The stranger came early in February, one wintry day, through a biting
wind and a driving snow, the last snowfall of the year, over the down,
walking from Bramblehurst railway station, and carrying a little black
portmanteau in his thickly gloved hand. He was wrapped up from head to
foot, and the brim of his soft felt hat hid every inch of his face but
the shiny tip of his nose; the snow had piled itself against his
shoulders and chest, and added a white crest to the burden he carried.
He staggered into the “Coach and Horses” more dead than alive, and
flung his portmanteau down. “A fire,” he cried, “in the name of human
charity! A room and a fire!” He stamped and shook the snow from off
himself in the bar, and followed Mrs. Hall into her guest parlour to
strike his bargain. And with that much introduction, that and a couple
of sovereigns flung upon the table, he took up his quarters in the inn.

Mrs. Hall lit the fire and left him there while she went to prepare him
a meal with her own hands. A guest to stop at Iping in the wintertime
was an unheard-of piece of luck, let alone a guest who was no
“haggler,” and she was resolved to show herself worthy of her good
fortune. As soon as the bacon was well under way, and Millie, her
lymphatic maid, had been brisked up a bit by a few deftly chosen
expressions of contempt, she carried the cloth, plates, and glasses
into the parlour and began to lay them with the utmost _éclat_.
Although the fire was burning up briskly, she was surprised to see that
her visitor still wore his hat and coat, standing with his back to her
and staring out of the window at the falling snow in the yard. His
gloved hands were clasped behind him, and he seemed to be lost in
thought. She noticed that the melting snow that still sprinkled his
shoulders dripped upon her carpet. “Can I take your hat and coat, sir?”
she said, “and give them a good dry in the kitchen?”

“No,” he said without turning.

She was not sure she had heard him, and was about to repeat her
question.

He turned his head and looked at her over his shoulder. “I prefer to
keep them on,” he said with emphasis, and she noticed that he wore big
blue spectacles with sidelights, and had a bush side-whisker over his
coat-collar that completely hid his cheeks and face.

“Very well, sir,” she said. “_As_ you like. In a bit the room will be
warmer.”

He made no answer, and had turned his face away from her again, and
Mrs. Hall, feeling that her conversational advances were ill-timed,
laid the rest of the table things in a quick staccato and whisked out
of the room. When she returned he was still standing there, like a man
of stone, his back hunched, his collar turned up, his dripping hat-brim
turned down, hiding his face and ears completely. She put down the eggs
and bacon with considerable emphasis, and called rather than said to
him, “Your lunch is served, sir.”

“Thank you,” he said at the same time, and did not stir until she was
closing the door. Then he swung round and approached the table with a
certain eager quickness.

As she went behind the bar to the kitchen she heard a sound repeated at
regular intervals. Chirk, chirk, chirk, it went, the sound of a spoon
being rapidly whisked round a basin. “That girl!” she said. “There! I
clean forgot it. It’s her being so long!” And while she herself
finished mixing the mustard, she gave Millie a few verbal stabs for her
excessive slowness. She had cooked the ham and eggs, laid the table,
and done everything, while Millie (help indeed!) had only succeeded in
delaying the mustard. And him a new guest and wanting to stay! Then she
filled the mustard pot, and, putting it with a certain stateliness upon
a gold and black tea-tray, carried it into the parlour.

She rapped and entered promptly. As she did so her visitor moved
quickly, so that she got but a glimpse of a white object disappearing
behind the table. It would seem he was picking something from the
floor. She rapped down the mustard pot on the table, and then she
noticed the overcoat and hat had been taken off and put over a chair in
front of the fire, and a pair of wet boots threatened rust to her steel
fender. She went to these things resolutely. “I suppose I may have them
to dry now,” she said in a voice that brooked no denial.

“Leave the hat,” said her visitor, in a muffled voice, and turning she
saw he had raised his head and was sitting and looking at her.

For a moment she stood gaping at him, too surprised to speak.

He held a white cloth—it was a serviette he had brought with him—over
the lower part of his face, so that his mouth and jaws were completely
hidden, and that was the reason of his muffled voice. But it was not
that which startled Mrs. Hall. It was the fact that all his forehead
above his blue glasses was covered by a white bandage, and that another
covered his ears, leaving not a scrap of his face exposed excepting
only his pink, peaked nose. It was bright, pink, and shiny just as it
had been at first. He wore a dark-brown velvet jacket with a high,
black, linen-lined collar turned up about his neck. The thick black
hair, escaping as it could below and between the cross bandages,
projected in curious tails and horns, giving him the strangest
appearance conceivable. This muffled and bandaged head was so unlike
what she had anticipated, that for a moment she was rigid.

He did not remove the serviette, but remained holding it, as she saw
now, with a brown gloved hand, and regarding her with his inscrutable
blue glasses. “Leave the hat,” he said, speaking very distinctly
through the white cloth.

Her nerves began to recover from the shock they had received. She
placed the hat on the chair again by the fire. “I didn’t know, sir,”
she began, “that—” and she stopped embarrassed.

“Thank you,” he said drily, glancing from her to the door and then at
her again.

“I’ll have them nicely dried, sir, at once,” she said, and carried his
clothes out of the room. She glanced at his white-swathed head and blue
goggles again as she was going out of the door; but his napkin was
still in front of his face. She shivered a little as she closed the
door behind her, and her face was eloquent of her surprise and
perplexity. “I _never_,” she whispered. “There!” She went quite softly
to the kitchen, and was too preoccupied to ask Millie what she was
messing about with _now_, when she got there.

The visitor sat and listened to her retreating feet. He glanced
inquiringly at the window before he removed his serviette, and resumed
his meal. He took a mouthful, glanced suspiciously at the window, took
another mouthful, then rose and, taking the serviette in his hand,
walked across the room and pulled the blind down to the top of the
white muslin that obscured the lower panes. This left the room in a
twilight. This done, he returned with an easier air to the table and
his meal.

“The poor soul’s had an accident or an op’ration or somethin’,” said
Mrs. Hall. “What a turn them bandages did give me, to be sure!”

She put on some more coal, unfolded the clothes-horse, and extended the
traveller’s coat upon this. “And they goggles! Why, he looked more like
a divin’ helmet than a human man!” She hung his muffler on a corner of
the horse. “And holding that handkerchief over his mouth all the time.
Talkin’ through it! ... Perhaps his mouth was hurt too—maybe.”

She turned round, as one who suddenly remembers. “Bless my soul alive!”
she said, going off at a tangent; “ain’t you done them taters _yet_,
Millie?”

When Mrs. Hall went to clear away the stranger’s lunch, her idea that
his mouth must also have been cut or disfigured in the accident she
supposed him to have suffered, was confirmed, for he was smoking a
pipe, and all the time that she was in the room he never loosened the
silk muffler he had wrapped round the lower part of his face to put the
mouthpiece to his lips. Yet it was not forgetfulness, for she saw he
glanced at it as it smouldered out. He sat in the corner with his back
to the window-blind and spoke now, having eaten and drunk and being
comfortably warmed through, with less aggressive brevity than before.
The reflection of the fire lent a kind of red animation to his big
spectacles they had lacked hitherto.

“I have some luggage,” he said, “at Bramblehurst station,” and he asked
her how he could have it sent. He bowed his bandaged head quite
politely in acknowledgment of her explanation. “To-morrow?” he said.
“There is no speedier delivery?” and seemed quite disappointed when she
answered, “No.” Was she quite sure? No man with a trap who would go
over?

Mrs. Hall, nothing loath, answered his questions and developed a
conversation. “It’s a steep road by the down, sir,” she said in answer
to the question about a trap; and then, snatching at an opening, said,
“It was there a carriage was upsettled, a year ago and more. A
gentleman killed, besides his coachman. Accidents, sir, happen in a
moment, don’t they?”

But the visitor was not to be drawn so easily. “They do,” he said
through his muffler, eyeing her quietly through his impenetrable
glasses.

“But they take long enough to get well, don’t they? ... There was my
sister’s son, Tom, jest cut his arm with a scythe, tumbled on it in the
’ayfield, and, bless me! he was three months tied up sir. You’d hardly
believe it. It’s regular given me a dread of a scythe, sir.”

“I can quite understand that,” said the visitor.

“He was afraid, one time, that he’d have to have an op’ration—he was
that bad, sir.”

The visitor laughed abruptly, a bark of a laugh that he seemed to bite
and kill in his mouth. “_Was_ he?” he said.

“He was, sir. And no laughing matter to them as had the doing for him,
as I had—my sister being took up with her little ones so much. There
was bandages to do, sir, and bandages to undo. So that if I may make so
bold as to say it, sir—”

“Will you get me some matches?” said the visitor, quite abruptly. “My
pipe is out.”

Mrs. Hall was pulled up suddenly. It was certainly rude of him, after
telling him all she had done. She gasped at him for a moment, and
remembered the two sovereigns. She went for the matches.

“Thanks,” he said concisely, as she put them down, and turned his
shoulder upon her and stared out of the window again. It was altogether
too discouraging. Evidently he was sensitive on the topic of operations
and bandages. She did not “make so bold as to say,” however, after all.
But his snubbing way had irritated her, and Millie had a hot time of it
that afternoon.

The visitor remained in the parlour until four o’clock, without giving
the ghost of an excuse for an intrusion. For the most part he was quite
still during that time; it would seem he sat in the growing darkness
smoking in the firelight—perhaps dozing.

Once or twice a curious listener might have heard him at the coals, and
for the space of five minutes he was audible pacing the room. He seemed
to be talking to himself. Then the armchair creaked as he sat down
again.




CHAPTER II.
MR. TEDDY HENFREY’S FIRST IMPRESSIONS


At four o’clock, when it was fairly dark and Mrs. Hall was screwing up
her courage to go in and ask her visitor if he would take some tea,
Teddy Henfrey, the clock-jobber, came into the bar. “My sakes! Mrs.
Hall,” said he, “but this is terrible weather for thin boots!” The snow
outside was falling faster.

Mrs. Hall agreed, and then noticed he had his bag with him. “Now you’re
here, Mr. Teddy,” said she, “I’d be glad if you’d give th’ old clock in
the parlour a bit of a look. ’Tis going, and it strikes well and
hearty; but the hour-hand won’t do nuthin’ but point at six.”

And leading the way, she went across to the parlour door and rapped and
entered.

Her visitor, she saw as she opened the door, was seated in the armchair
before the fire, dozing it would seem, with his bandaged head drooping
on one side. The only light in the room was the red glow from the
fire—which lit his eyes like adverse railway signals, but left his
downcast face in darkness—and the scanty vestiges of the day that came
in through the open door. Everything was ruddy, shadowy, and indistinct
to her, the more so since she had just been lighting the bar lamp, and
her eyes were dazzled. But for a second it seemed to her that the man
she looked at had an enormous mouth wide open—a vast and incredible
mouth that swallowed the whole of the lower portion of his face. It was
the sensation of a moment: the white-bound head, the monstrous goggle
eyes, and this huge yawn below it. Then he stirred, started up in his
chair, put up his hand. She opened the door wide, so that the room was
lighter, and she saw him more clearly, with the muffler held up to his
face just as she had seen him hold the serviette before. The shadows,
she fancied, had tricked her.

“Would you mind, sir, this man a-coming to look at the clock, sir?” she
said, recovering from the momentary shock.

“Look at the clock?” he said, staring round in a drowsy manner, and
speaking over his hand, and then, getting more fully awake,
“certainly.”

Mrs. Hall went away to get a lamp, and he rose and stretched himself.
Then came the light, and Mr. Teddy Henfrey, entering, was confronted by
this bandaged person. He was, he says, “taken aback.”

“Good afternoon,” said the stranger, regarding him—as Mr. Henfrey says,
with a vivid sense of the dark spectacles—“like a lobster.”

“I hope,” said Mr. Henfrey, “that it’s no intrusion.”

“None whatever,” said the stranger. “Though, I understand,” he said
turning to Mrs. Hall, “that this room is really to be mine for my own
private use.”

“I thought, sir,” said Mrs. Hall, “you’d prefer the clock—”

“Certainly,” said the stranger, “certainly—but, as a rule, I like to be
alone and undisturbed.

“But I’m really glad to have the clock seen to,” he said, seeing a
certain hesitation in Mr. Henfrey’s manner. “Very glad.” Mr. Henfrey
had intended to apologise and withdraw, but this anticipation reassured
him. The stranger turned round with his back to the fireplace and put
his hands behind his back. “And presently,” he said, “when the
clock-mending is over, I think I should like to have some tea. But not
till the clock-mending is over.”

Mrs. Hall was about to leave the room—she made no conversational
advances this time, because she did not want to be snubbed in front of
Mr. Henfrey—when her visitor asked her if she had made any arrangements
about his boxes at Bramblehurst. She told him she had mentioned the
matter to the postman, and that the carrier could bring them over on
the morrow. “You are certain that is the earliest?” he said.

She was certain, with a marked coldness.

“I should explain,” he added, “what I was really too cold and fatigued
to do before, that I am an experimental investigator.”

“Indeed, sir,” said Mrs. Hall, much impressed.

“And my baggage contains apparatus and appliances.”

“Very useful things indeed they are, sir,” said Mrs. Hall.

“And I’m very naturally anxious to get on with my inquiries.”

“Of course, sir.”

“My reason for coming to Iping,” he proceeded, with a certain
deliberation of manner, “was ... a desire for solitude. I do not wish
to be disturbed in my work. In addition to my work, an accident—”

“I thought as much,” said Mrs. Hall to herself.

“—necessitates a certain retirement. My eyes—are sometimes so weak and
painful that I have to shut myself up in the dark for hours together.
Lock myself up. Sometimes—now and then. Not at present, certainly. At
such times the slightest disturbance, the entry of a stranger into the
room, is a source of excruciating annoyance to me—it is well these
things should be understood.”

“Certainly, sir,” said Mrs. Hall. “And if I might make so bold as to
ask—”

“That I think, is all,” said the stranger, with that quietly
irresistible air of finality he could assume at will. Mrs. Hall
reserved her question and sympathy for a better occasion.

After Mrs. Hall had left the room, he remained standing in front of the
fire, glaring, so Mr. Henfrey puts it, at the clock-mending. Mr.
Henfrey not only took off the hands of the clock, and the face, but
extracted the works; and he tried to work in as slow and quiet and
unassuming a manner as possible. He worked with the lamp close to him,
and the green shade threw a brilliant light upon his hands, and upon
the frame and wheels, and left the rest of the room shadowy. When he
looked up, coloured patches swam in his eyes. Being constitutionally of
a curious nature, he had removed the works—a quite unnecessary
proceeding—with the idea of delaying his departure and perhaps falling
into conversation with the stranger. But the stranger stood there,
perfectly silent and still. So still, it got on Henfrey’s nerves. He
felt alone in the room and looked up, and there, grey and dim, was the
bandaged head and huge blue lenses staring fixedly, with a mist of
green spots drifting in front of them. It was so uncanny to Henfrey
that for a minute they remained staring blankly at one another. Then
Henfrey looked down again. Very uncomfortable position! One would like
to say something. Should he remark that the weather was very cold for
the time of year?

He looked up as if to take aim with that introductory shot. “The
weather—” he began.

“Why don’t you finish and go?” said the rigid figure, evidently in a
state of painfully suppressed rage. “All you’ve got to do is to fix the
hour-hand on its axle. You’re simply humbugging—”

“Certainly, sir—one minute more. I overlooked—” and Mr. Henfrey
finished and went.

But he went feeling excessively annoyed. “Damn it!” said Mr. Henfrey to
himself, trudging down the village through the thawing snow; “a man
must do a clock at times, surely.”

And again, “Can’t a man look at you?—Ugly!”

And yet again, “Seemingly not. If the police was wanting you you
couldn’t be more wropped and bandaged.”

At Gleeson’s corner he saw Hall, who had recently married the
stranger’s hostess at the “Coach and Horses,” and who now drove the
Iping conveyance, when occasional people required it, to Sidderbridge
Junction, coming towards him on his return from that place. Hall had
evidently been “stopping a bit” at Sidderbridge, to judge by his
driving. “’Ow do, Teddy?” he said, passing.

“You got a rum un up home!” said Teddy.

Hall very sociably pulled up. “What’s that?” he asked.

“Rum-looking customer stopping at the ‘Coach and Horses,’” said Teddy.
“My sakes!”

And he proceeded to give Hall a vivid description of his grotesque
guest. “Looks a bit like a disguise, don’t it? I’d like to see a man’s
face if I had him stopping in _my_ place,” said Henfrey. “But women are
that trustful—where strangers are concerned. He’s took your rooms and
he ain’t even given a name, Hall.”

“You don’t say so!” said Hall, who was a man of sluggish apprehension.

“Yes,” said Teddy. “By the week. Whatever he is, you can’t get rid of
him under the week. And he’s got a lot of luggage coming to-morrow, so
he says. Let’s hope it won’t be stones in boxes, Hall.”

He told Hall how his aunt at Hastings had been swindled by a stranger
with empty portmanteaux. Altogether he left Hall vaguely suspicious.
“Get up, old girl,” said Hall. “I s’pose I must see ’bout this.”

Teddy trudged on his way with his mind considerably relieved.

Instead of “seeing ’bout it,” however, Hall on his return was severely
rated by his wife on the length of time he had spent in Sidderbridge,
and his mild inquiries were answered snappishly and in a manner not to
the point. But the seed of suspicion Teddy had sown germinated in the
mind of Mr. Hall in spite of these discouragements. “You wim’ don’t
know everything,” said Mr. Hall, resolved to ascertain more about the
personality of his guest at the earliest possible opportunity. And
after the stranger had gone to bed, which he did about half-past nine,
Mr. Hall went very aggressively into the parlour and looked very hard
at his wife’s furniture, just to show that the stranger wasn’t master
there, and scrutinised closely and a little contemptuously a sheet of
mathematical computations the stranger had left. When retiring for the
night he instructed Mrs. Hall to look very closely at the stranger’s
luggage when it came next day.

“You mind your own business, Hall,” said Mrs. Hall, “and I’ll mind
mine.”

She was all the more inclined to snap at Hall because the stranger was
undoubtedly an unusually strange sort of stranger, and she was by no
means assured about him in her own mind. In the middle of the night she
woke up dreaming of huge white heads like turnips, that came trailing
after her, at the end of interminable necks, and with vast black eyes.
But being a sensible woman, she subdued her terrors and turned over and
went to sleep again.




CHAPTER III.
THE THOUSAND AND ONE BOTTLES


So it was that on the twenty-ninth day of February, at the beginning of
the thaw, this singular person fell out of infinity into Iping village.
Next day his luggage arrived through the slush—and very remarkable
luggage it was. There were a couple of trunks indeed, such as a
rational man might need, but in addition there were a box of books—big,
fat books, of which some were just in an incomprehensible
handwriting—and a dozen or more crates, boxes, and cases, containing
objects packed in straw, as it seemed to Hall, tugging with a casual
curiosity at the straw—glass bottles. The stranger, muffled in hat,
coat, gloves, and wrapper, came out impatiently to meet Fearenside’s
cart, while Hall was having a word or so of gossip preparatory to
helping bring them in. Out he came, not noticing Fearenside’s dog, who
was sniffing in a _dilettante_ spirit at Hall’s legs. “Come along with
those boxes,” he said. “I’ve been waiting long enough.”

And he came down the steps towards the tail of the cart as if to lay
hands on the smaller crate.

No sooner had Fearenside’s dog caught sight of him, however, than it
began to bristle and growl savagely, and when he rushed down the steps
it gave an undecided hop, and then sprang straight at his hand. “Whup!”
cried Hall, jumping back, for he was no hero with dogs, and Fearenside
howled, “Lie down!” and snatched his whip.

They saw the dog’s teeth had slipped the hand, heard a kick, saw the
dog execute a flanking jump and get home on the stranger’s leg, and
heard the rip of his trousering. Then the finer end of Fearenside’s
whip reached his property, and the dog, yelping with dismay, retreated
under the wheels of the waggon. It was all the business of a swift
half-minute. No one spoke, everyone shouted. The stranger glanced
swiftly at his torn glove and at his leg, made as if he would stoop to
the latter, then turned and rushed swiftly up the steps into the inn.
They heard him go headlong across the passage and up the uncarpeted
stairs to his bedroom.

“You brute, you!” said Fearenside, climbing off the waggon with his
whip in his hand, while the dog watched him through the wheel. “Come
here,” said Fearenside—“You’d better.”

Hall had stood gaping. “He wuz bit,” said Hall. “I’d better go and see
to en,” and he trotted after the stranger. He met Mrs. Hall in the
passage. “Carrier’s darg,” he said “bit en.”

He went straight upstairs, and the stranger’s door being ajar, he
pushed it open and was entering without any ceremony, being of a
naturally sympathetic turn of mind.

The blind was down and the room dim. He caught a glimpse of a most
singular thing, what seemed a handless arm waving towards him, and a
face of three huge indeterminate spots on white, very like the face of
a pale pansy. Then he was struck violently in the chest, hurled back,
and the door slammed in his face and locked. It was so rapid that it
gave him no time to observe. A waving of indecipherable shapes, a blow,
and a concussion. There he stood on the dark little landing, wondering
what it might be that he had seen.

A couple of minutes after, he rejoined the little group that had formed
outside the “Coach and Horses.” There was Fearenside telling about it
all over again for the second time; there was Mrs. Hall saying his dog
didn’t have no business to bite her guests; there was Huxter, the
general dealer from over the road, interrogative; and Sandy Wadgers
from the forge, judicial; besides women and children, all of them
saying fatuities: “Wouldn’t let en bite _me_, I knows”; “’Tasn’t right
_have_ such dargs”; “Whad ’_e_ bite ’n for, then?” and so forth.

Mr. Hall, staring at them from the steps and listening, found it
incredible that he had seen anything so very remarkable happen
upstairs. Besides, his vocabulary was altogether too limited to express
his impressions.

“He don’t want no help, he says,” he said in answer to his wife’s
inquiry. “We’d better be a-takin’ of his luggage in.”

“He ought to have it cauterised at once,” said Mr. Huxter; “especially
if it’s at all inflamed.”

“I’d shoot en, that’s what I’d do,” said a lady in the group.

Suddenly the dog began growling again.

“Come along,” cried an angry voice in the doorway, and there stood the
muffled stranger with his collar turned up, and his hat-brim bent down.
“The sooner you get those things in the better I’ll be pleased.” It is
stated by an anonymous bystander that his trousers and gloves had been
changed.

“Was you hurt, sir?” said Fearenside. “I’m rare sorry the darg—”

“Not a bit,” said the stranger. “Never broke the skin. Hurry up with
those things.”

He then swore to himself, so Mr. Hall asserts.

Directly the first crate was, in accordance with his directions,
carried into the parlour, the stranger flung himself upon it with
extraordinary eagerness, and began to unpack it, scattering the straw
with an utter disregard of Mrs. Hall’s carpet. And from it he began to
produce bottles—little fat bottles containing powders, small and
slender bottles containing coloured and white fluids, fluted blue
bottles labeled Poison, bottles with round bodies and slender necks,
large green-glass bottles, large white-glass bottles, bottles with
glass stoppers and frosted labels, bottles with fine corks, bottles
with bungs, bottles with wooden caps, wine bottles, salad-oil
bottles—putting them in rows on the chiffonnier, on the mantel, on the
table under the window, round the floor, on the bookshelf—everywhere.
The chemist’s shop in Bramblehurst could not boast half so many. Quite
a sight it was. Crate after crate yielded bottles, until all six were
empty and the table high with straw; the only things that came out of
these crates besides the bottles were a number of test-tubes and a
carefully packed balance.

And directly the crates were unpacked, the stranger went to the window
and set to work, not troubling in the least about the litter of straw,
the fire which had gone out, the box of books outside, nor for the
trunks and other luggage that had gone upstairs.

When Mrs. Hall took his dinner in to him, he was already so absorbed in
his work, pouring little drops out of the bottles into test-tubes, that
he did not hear her until she had swept away the bulk of the straw and
put the tray on the table, with some little emphasis perhaps, seeing
the state that the floor was in. Then he half turned his head and
immediately turned it away again. But she saw he had removed his
glasses; they were beside him on the table, and it seemed to her that
his eye sockets were extraordinarily hollow. He put on his spectacles
again, and then turned and faced her. She was about to complain of the
straw on the floor when he anticipated her.

“I wish you wouldn’t come in without knocking,” he said in the tone of
abnormal exasperation that seemed so characteristic of him.

“I knocked, but seemingly—”

“Perhaps you did. But in my investigations—my really very urgent and
necessary investigations—the slightest disturbance, the jar of a door—I
must ask you—”

“Certainly, sir. You can turn the lock if you’re like that, you know.
Any time.”

“A very good idea,” said the stranger.

“This stror, sir, if I might make so bold as to remark—”

“Don’t. If the straw makes trouble put it down in the bill.” And he
mumbled at her—words suspiciously like curses.

He was so odd, standing there, so aggressive and explosive, bottle in
one hand and test-tube in the other, that Mrs. Hall was quite alarmed.
But she was a resolute woman. “In which case, I should like to know,
sir, what you consider—”

“A shilling—put down a shilling. Surely a shilling’s enough?”

“So be it,” said Mrs. Hall, taking up the table-cloth and beginning to
spread it over the table. “If you’re satisfied, of course—”

He turned and sat down, with his coat-collar toward her.

All the afternoon he worked with the door locked and, as Mrs. Hall
testifies, for the most part in silence. But once there was a
concussion and a sound of bottles ringing together as though the table
had been hit, and the smash of a bottle flung violently down, and then
a rapid pacing athwart the room. Fearing “something was the matter,”
she went to the door and listened, not caring to knock.

“I can’t go on,” he was raving. “I _can’t_ go on. Three hundred
thousand, four hundred thousand! The huge multitude! Cheated! All my
life it may take me! ... Patience! Patience indeed! ... Fool! fool!”

There was a noise of hobnails on the bricks in the bar, and Mrs. Hall
had very reluctantly to leave the rest of his soliloquy. When she
returned the room was silent again, save for the faint crepitation of
his chair and the occasional clink of a bottle. It was all over; the
stranger had resumed work.

When she took in his tea she saw broken glass in the corner of the room
under the concave mirror, and a golden stain that had been carelessly
wiped. She called attention to it.

“Put it down in the bill,” snapped her visitor. “For God’s sake don’t
worry me. If there’s damage done, put it down in the bill,” and he went
on ticking a list in the exercise book before him.

“I’ll tell you something,” said Fearenside, mysteriously. It was late
in the afternoon, and they were in the little beer-shop of Iping
Hanger.

“Well?” said Teddy Henfrey.

“This chap you’re speaking of, what my dog bit. Well—he’s black.
Leastways, his legs are. I seed through the tear of his trousers and
the tear of his glove. You’d have expected a sort of pinky to show,
wouldn’t you? Well—there wasn’t none. Just blackness. I tell you, he’s
as black as my hat.”

“My sakes!” said Henfrey. “It’s a rummy case altogether. Why, his nose
is as pink as paint!”

“That’s true,” said Fearenside. “I knows that. And I tell ’ee what I’m
thinking. That marn’s a piebald, Teddy. Black here and white there—in
patches. And he’s ashamed of it. He’s a kind of half-breed, and the
colour’s come off patchy instead of mixing. I’ve heard of such things
before. And it’s the common way with horses, as any one can see.”




CHAPTER IV.
MR. CUSS INTERVIEWS THE STRANGER


I have told the circumstances of the stranger’s arrival in Iping with a
certain fulness of detail, in order that the curious impression he
created may be understood by the reader. But excepting two odd
incidents, the circumstances of his stay until the extraordinary day of
the club festival may be passed over very cursorily. There were a
number of skirmishes with Mrs. Hall on matters of domestic discipline,
but in every case until late April, when the first signs of penury
began, he over-rode her by the easy expedient of an extra payment. Hall
did not like him, and whenever he dared he talked of the advisability
of getting rid of him; but he showed his dislike chiefly by concealing
it ostentatiously, and avoiding his visitor as much as possible. “Wait
till the summer,” said Mrs. Hall sagely, “when the artisks are
beginning to come. Then we’ll see. He may be a bit overbearing, but
bills settled punctual is bills settled punctual, whatever you’d like
to say.”

The stranger did not go to church, and indeed made no difference
between Sunday and the irreligious days, even in costume. He worked, as
Mrs. Hall thought, very fitfully. Some days he would come down early
and be continuously busy. On others he would rise late, pace his room,
fretting audibly for hours together, smoke, sleep in the armchair by
the fire. Communication with the world beyond the village he had none.
His temper continued very uncertain; for the most part his manner was
that of a man suffering under almost unendurable provocation, and once
or twice things were snapped, torn, crushed, or broken in spasmodic
gusts of violence. He seemed under a chronic irritation of the greatest
intensity. His habit of talking to himself in a low voice grew steadily
upon him, but though Mrs. Hall listened conscientiously she could make
neither head nor tail of what she heard.

He rarely went abroad by daylight, but at twilight he would go out
muffled up invisibly, whether the weather were cold or not, and he
chose the loneliest paths and those most overshadowed by trees and
banks. His goggling spectacles and ghastly bandaged face under the
penthouse of his hat, came with a disagreeable suddenness out of the
darkness upon one or two home-going labourers, and Teddy Henfrey,
tumbling out of the “Scarlet Coat” one night, at half-past nine, was
scared shamefully by the stranger’s skull-like head (he was walking hat
in hand) lit by the sudden light of the opened inn door. Such children
as saw him at nightfall dreamt of bogies, and it seemed doubtful
whether he disliked boys more than they disliked him, or the reverse;
but there was certainly a vivid enough dislike on either side.

It was inevitable that a person of so remarkable an appearance and
bearing should form a frequent topic in such a village as Iping.
Opinion was greatly divided about his occupation. Mrs. Hall was
sensitive on the point. When questioned, she explained very carefully
that he was an “experimental investigator,” going gingerly over the
syllables as one who dreads pitfalls. When asked what an experimental
investigator was, she would say with a touch of superiority that most
educated people knew such things as that, and would thus explain that
he “discovered things.” Her visitor had had an accident, she said,
which temporarily discoloured his face and hands, and being of a
sensitive disposition, he was averse to any public notice of the fact.

Out of her hearing there was a view largely entertained that he was a
criminal trying to escape from justice by wrapping himself up so as to
conceal himself altogether from the eye of the police. This idea sprang
from the brain of Mr. Teddy Henfrey. No crime of any magnitude dating
from the middle or end of February was known to have occurred.
Elaborated in the imagination of Mr. Gould, the probationary assistant
in the National School, this theory took the form that the stranger was
an Anarchist in disguise, preparing explosives, and he resolved to
undertake such detective operations as his time permitted. These
consisted for the most part in looking very hard at the stranger
whenever they met, or in asking people who had never seen the stranger,
leading questions about him. But he detected nothing.

Another school of opinion followed Mr. Fearenside, and either accepted
the piebald view or some modification of it; as, for instance, Silas
Durgan, who was heard to assert that “if he chooses to show enself at
fairs he’d make his fortune in no time,” and being a bit of a
theologian, compared the stranger to the man with the one talent. Yet
another view explained the entire matter by regarding the stranger as a
harmless lunatic. That had the advantage of accounting for everything
straight away.

Between these main groups there were waverers and compromisers. Sussex
folk have few superstitions, and it was only after the events of early
April that the thought of the supernatural was first whispered in the
village. Even then it was only credited among the women folk.

But whatever they thought of him, people in Iping, on the whole, agreed
in disliking him. His irritability, though it might have been
comprehensible to an urban brain-worker, was an amazing thing to these
quiet Sussex villagers. The frantic gesticulations they surprised now
and then, the headlong pace after nightfall that swept him upon them
round quiet corners, the inhuman bludgeoning of all tentative advances
of curiosity, the taste for twilight that led to the closing of doors,
the pulling down of blinds, the extinction of candles and lamps—who
could agree with such goings on? They drew aside as he passed down the
village, and when he had gone by, young humourists would up with
coat-collars and down with hat-brims, and go pacing nervously after him
in imitation of his occult bearing. There was a song popular at that
time called “The Bogey Man”. Miss Statchell sang it at the schoolroom
concert (in aid of the church lamps), and thereafter whenever one or
two of the villagers were gathered together and the stranger appeared,
a bar or so of this tune, more or less sharp or flat, was whistled in
the midst of them. Also belated little children would call “Bogey Man!”
after him, and make off tremulously elated.

Cuss, the general practitioner, was devoured by curiosity. The bandages
excited his professional interest, the report of the thousand and one
bottles aroused his jealous regard. All through April and May he
coveted an opportunity of talking to the stranger, and at last, towards
Whitsuntide, he could stand it no longer, but hit upon the
subscription-list for a village nurse as an excuse. He was surprised to
find that Mr. Hall did not know his guest’s name. “He give a name,”
said Mrs. Hall—an assertion which was quite unfounded—“but I didn’t
rightly hear it.” She thought it seemed so silly not to know the man’s
name.

Cuss rapped at the parlour door and entered. There was a fairly audible
imprecation from within. “Pardon my intrusion,” said Cuss, and then the
door closed and cut Mrs. Hall off from the rest of the conversation.

She could hear the murmur of voices for the next ten minutes, then a
cry of surprise, a stirring of feet, a chair flung aside, a bark of
laughter, quick steps to the door, and Cuss appeared, his face white,
his eyes staring over his shoulder. He left the door open behind him,
and without looking at her strode across the hall and went down the
steps, and she heard his feet hurrying along the road. He carried his
hat in his hand. She stood behind the door, looking at the open door of
the parlour. Then she heard the stranger laughing quietly, and then his
footsteps came across the room. She could not see his face where she
stood. The parlour door slammed, and the place was silent again.

Cuss went straight up the village to Bunting the vicar. “Am I mad?”
Cuss began abruptly, as he entered the shabby little study. “Do I look
like an insane person?”

“What’s happened?” said the vicar, putting the ammonite on the loose
sheets of his forth-coming sermon.

“That chap at the inn—”

“Well?”

“Give me something to drink,” said Cuss, and he sat down.

When his nerves had been steadied by a glass of cheap sherry—the only
drink the good vicar had available—he told him of the interview he had
just had. “Went in,” he gasped, “and began to demand a subscription for
that Nurse Fund. He’d stuck his hands in his pockets as I came in, and
he sat down lumpily in his chair. Sniffed. I told him I’d heard he took
an interest in scientific things. He said yes. Sniffed again. Kept on
sniffing all the time; evidently recently caught an infernal cold. No
wonder, wrapped up like that! I developed the nurse idea, and all the
while kept my eyes open. Bottles—chemicals—everywhere. Balance,
test-tubes in stands, and a smell of—evening primrose. Would he
subscribe? Said he’d consider it. Asked him, point-blank, was he
researching. Said he was. A long research? Got quite cross. ‘A damnable
long research,’ said he, blowing the cork out, so to speak. ‘Oh,’ said
I. And out came the grievance. The man was just on the boil, and my
question boiled him over. He had been given a prescription, most
valuable prescription—what for he wouldn’t say. Was it medical? ‘Damn
you! What are you fishing after?’ I apologised. Dignified sniff and
cough. He resumed. He’d read it. Five ingredients. Put it down; turned
his head. Draught of air from window lifted the paper. Swish, rustle.
He was working in a room with an open fireplace, he said. Saw a
flicker, and there was the prescription burning and lifting
chimneyward. Rushed towards it just as it whisked up the chimney. So!
Just at that point, to illustrate his story, out came his arm.”

“Well?”

“No hand—just an empty sleeve. Lord! I thought, _that’s_ a deformity!
Got a cork arm, I suppose, and has taken it off. Then, I thought,
there’s something odd in that. What the devil keeps that sleeve up and
open, if there’s nothing in it? There was nothing in it, I tell you.
Nothing down it, right down to the joint. I could see right down it to
the elbow, and there was a glimmer of light shining through a tear of
the cloth. ‘Good God!’ I said. Then he stopped. Stared at me with those
black goggles of his, and then at his sleeve.”

“Well?”

“That’s all. He never said a word; just glared, and put his sleeve back
in his pocket quickly. ‘I was saying,’ said he, ‘that there was the
prescription burning, wasn’t I?’ Interrogative cough. ‘How the devil,’
said I, ‘can you move an empty sleeve like that?’ ‘Empty sleeve?’
‘Yes,’ said I, ‘an empty sleeve.’

“‘It’s an empty sleeve, is it? You saw it was an empty sleeve?’ He
stood up right away. I stood up too. He came towards me in three very
slow steps, and stood quite close. Sniffed venomously. I didn’t flinch,
though I’m hanged if that bandaged knob of his, and those blinkers,
aren’t enough to unnerve any one, coming quietly up to you.

“‘You said it was an empty sleeve?’ he said. ‘Certainly,’ I said. At
staring and saying nothing a barefaced man, unspectacled, starts
scratch. Then very quietly he pulled his sleeve out of his pocket
again, and raised his arm towards me as though he would show it to me
again. He did it very, very slowly. I looked at it. Seemed an age.
‘Well?’ said I, clearing my throat, ‘there’s nothing in it.’

“Had to say something. I was beginning to feel frightened. I could see
right down it. He extended it straight towards me, slowly, slowly—just
like that—until the cuff was six inches from my face. Queer thing to
see an empty sleeve come at you like that! And then—”

“Well?”

“Something—exactly like a finger and thumb it felt—nipped my nose.”

Bunting began to laugh.

“There wasn’t anything there!” said Cuss, his voice running up into a
shriek at the “there.” “It’s all very well for you to laugh, but I tell
you I was so startled, I hit his cuff hard, and turned around, and cut
out of the room—I left him—”

Cuss stopped. There was no mistaking the sincerity of his panic. He
turned round in a helpless way and took a second glass of the excellent
vicar’s very inferior sherry. “When I hit his cuff,” said Cuss, “I tell
you, it felt exactly like hitting an arm. And there wasn’t an arm!
There wasn’t the ghost of an arm!”

Mr. Bunting thought it over. He looked suspiciously at Cuss. “It’s a
most remarkable story,” he said. He looked very wise and grave indeed.
“It’s really,” said Mr. Bunting with judicial emphasis, “a most
remarkable story.”




CHAPTER V.
THE BURGLARY AT THE VICARAGE


The facts of the burglary at the vicarage came to us chiefly through
the medium of the vicar and his wife. It occurred in the small hours of
Whit Monday, the day devoted in Iping to the Club festivities. Mrs.
Bunting, it seems, woke up suddenly in the stillness that comes before
the dawn, with the strong impression that the door of their bedroom had
opened and closed. She did not arouse her husband at first, but sat up
in bed listening. She then distinctly heard the pad, pad, pad of bare
feet coming out of the adjoining dressing-room and walking along the
passage towards the staircase. As soon as she felt assured of this, she
aroused the Rev. Mr. Bunting as quietly as possible. He did not strike
a light, but putting on his spectacles, her dressing-gown and his bath
slippers, he went out on the landing to listen. He heard quite
distinctly a fumbling going on at his study desk down-stairs, and then
a violent sneeze.

At that he returned to his bedroom, armed himself with the most obvious
weapon, the poker, and descended the staircase as noiselessly as
possible. Mrs. Bunting came out on the landing.

The hour was about four, and the ultimate darkness of the night was
past. There was a faint shimmer of light in the hall, but the study
doorway yawned impenetrably black. Everything was still except the
faint creaking of the stairs under Mr. Bunting’s tread, and the slight
movements in the study. Then something snapped, the drawer was opened,
and there was a rustle of papers. Then came an imprecation, and a match
was struck and the study was flooded with yellow light. Mr. Bunting was
now in the hall, and through the crack of the door he could see the
desk and the open drawer and a candle burning on the desk. But the
robber he could not see. He stood there in the hall undecided what to
do, and Mrs. Bunting, her face white and intent, crept slowly
downstairs after him. One thing kept Mr. Bunting’s courage; the
persuasion that this burglar was a resident in the village.

They heard the chink of money, and realised that the robber had found
the housekeeping reserve of gold—two pounds ten in half sovereigns
altogether. At that sound Mr. Bunting was nerved to abrupt action.
Gripping the poker firmly, he rushed into the room, closely followed by
Mrs. Bunting. “Surrender!” cried Mr. Bunting, fiercely, and then
stooped amazed. Apparently the room was perfectly empty.

Yet their conviction that they had, that very moment, heard somebody
moving in the room had amounted to a certainty. For half a minute,
perhaps, they stood gaping, then Mrs. Bunting went across the room and
looked behind the screen, while Mr. Bunting, by a kindred impulse,
peered under the desk. Then Mrs. Bunting turned back the
window-curtains, and Mr. Bunting looked up the chimney and probed it
with the poker. Then Mrs. Bunting scrutinised the waste-paper basket
and Mr. Bunting opened the lid of the coal-scuttle. Then they came to a
stop and stood with eyes interrogating each other.

“I could have sworn—” said Mr. Bunting.

“The candle!” said Mr. Bunting. “Who lit the candle?”

“The drawer!” said Mrs. Bunting. “And the money’s gone!”

She went hastily to the doorway.

“Of all the strange occurrences—”

There was a violent sneeze in the passage. They rushed out, and as they
did so the kitchen door slammed. “Bring the candle,” said Mr. Bunting,
and led the way. They both heard a sound of bolts being hastily shot
back.

As he opened the kitchen door he saw through the scullery that the back
door was just opening, and the faint light of early dawn displayed the
dark masses of the garden beyond. He is certain that nothing went out
of the door. It opened, stood open for a moment, and then closed with a
slam. As it did so, the candle Mrs. Bunting was carrying from the study
flickered and flared. It was a minute or more before they entered the
kitchen.

The place was empty. They refastened the back door, examined the
kitchen, pantry, and scullery thoroughly, and at last went down into
the cellar. There was not a soul to be found in the house, search as
they would.

Daylight found the vicar and his wife, a quaintly-costumed little
couple, still marvelling about on their own ground floor by the
unnecessary light of a guttering candle.




CHAPTER VI.
THE FURNITURE THAT WENT MAD


Now it happened that in the early hours of Whit Monday, before Millie
was hunted out for the day, Mr. Hall and Mrs. Hall both rose and went
noiselessly down into the cellar. Their business there was of a private
nature, and had something to do with the specific gravity of their
beer. They had hardly entered the cellar when Mrs. Hall found she had
forgotten to bring down a bottle of sarsaparilla from their joint-room.
As she was the expert and principal operator in this affair, Hall very
properly went upstairs for it.

On the landing he was surprised to see that the stranger’s door was
ajar. He went on into his own room and found the bottle as he had been
directed.

But returning with the bottle, he noticed that the bolts of the front
door had been shot back, that the door was in fact simply on the latch.
And with a flash of inspiration he connected this with the stranger’s
room upstairs and the suggestions of Mr. Teddy Henfrey. He distinctly
remembered holding the candle while Mrs. Hall shot these bolts
overnight. At the sight he stopped, gaping, then with the bottle still
in his hand went upstairs again. He rapped at the stranger’s door.
There was no answer. He rapped again; then pushed the door wide open
and entered.

It was as he expected. The bed, the room also, was empty. And what was
stranger, even to his heavy intelligence, on the bedroom chair and
along the rail of the bed were scattered the garments, the only
garments so far as he knew, and the bandages of their guest. His big
slouch hat even was cocked jauntily over the bed-post.

As Hall stood there he heard his wife’s voice coming out of the depth
of the cellar, with that rapid telescoping of the syllables and
interrogative cocking up of the final words to a high note, by which
the West Sussex villager is wont to indicate a brisk impatience.
“George! You gart whad a wand?”

At that he turned and hurried down to her. “Janny,” he said, over the
rail of the cellar steps, “’tas the truth what Henfrey sez. ’E’s not in
uz room, ’e en’t. And the front door’s onbolted.”

At first Mrs. Hall did not understand, and as soon as she did she
resolved to see the empty room for herself. Hall, still holding the
bottle, went first. “If ’e en’t there,” he said, “’is close are. And
what’s ’e doin’ ’ithout ’is close, then? ’Tas a most curious business.”

As they came up the cellar steps they both, it was afterwards
ascertained, fancied they heard the front door open and shut, but
seeing it closed and nothing there, neither said a word to the other
about it at the time. Mrs. Hall passed her husband in the passage and
ran on first upstairs. Someone sneezed on the staircase. Hall,
following six steps behind, thought that he heard her sneeze. She,
going on first, was under the impression that Hall was sneezing. She
flung open the door and stood regarding the room. “Of all the curious!”
she said.

She heard a sniff close behind her head as it seemed, and turning, was
surprised to see Hall a dozen feet off on the topmost stair. But in
another moment he was beside her. She bent forward and put her hand on
the pillow and then under the clothes.

“Cold,” she said. “He’s been up this hour or more.”

As she did so, a most extraordinary thing happened. The bed-clothes
gathered themselves together, leapt up suddenly into a sort of peak,
and then jumped headlong over the bottom rail. It was exactly as if a
hand had clutched them in the centre and flung them aside. Immediately
after, the stranger’s hat hopped off the bed-post, described a whirling
flight in the air through the better part of a circle, and then dashed
straight at Mrs. Hall’s face. Then as swiftly came the sponge from the
washstand; and then the chair, flinging the stranger’s coat and
trousers carelessly aside, and laughing drily in a voice singularly
like the stranger’s, turned itself up with its four legs at Mrs. Hall,
seemed to take aim at her for a moment, and charged at her. She
screamed and turned, and then the chair legs came gently but firmly
against her back and impelled her and Hall out of the room. The door
slammed violently and was locked. The chair and bed seemed to be
executing a dance of triumph for a moment, and then abruptly everything
was still.

Mrs. Hall was left almost in a fainting condition in Mr. Hall’s arms on
the landing. It was with the greatest difficulty that Mr. Hall and
Millie, who had been roused by her scream of alarm, succeeded in
getting her downstairs, and applying the restoratives customary in such
cases.

“’Tas sperits,” said Mrs. Hall. “I know ’tas sperits. I’ve read in
papers of en. Tables and chairs leaping and dancing...”

“Take a drop more, Janny,” said Hall. “’Twill steady ye.”

“Lock him out,” said Mrs. Hall. “Don’t let him come in again. I half
guessed—I might ha’ known. With them goggling eyes and bandaged head,
and never going to church of a Sunday. And all they bottles—more’n it’s
right for any one to have. He’s put the sperits into the furniture....
My good old furniture! ’Twas in that very chair my poor dear mother
used to sit when I was a little girl. To think it should rise up
against me now!”

“Just a drop more, Janny,” said Hall. “Your nerves is all upset.”

They sent Millie across the street through the golden five o’clock
sunshine to rouse up Mr. Sandy Wadgers, the blacksmith. Mr. Hall’s
compliments and the furniture upstairs was behaving most extraordinary.
Would Mr. Wadgers come round? He was a knowing man, was Mr. Wadgers,
and very resourceful. He took quite a grave view of the case. “Arm
darmed if thet ent witchcraft,” was the view of Mr. Sandy Wadgers. “You
warnt horseshoes for such gentry as he.”

He came round greatly concerned. They wanted him to lead the way
upstairs to the room, but he didn’t seem to be in any hurry. He
preferred to talk in the passage. Over the way Huxter’s apprentice came
out and began taking down the shutters of the tobacco window. He was
called over to join the discussion. Mr. Huxter naturally followed over
in the course of a few minutes. The Anglo-Saxon genius for
parliamentary government asserted itself; there was a great deal of
talk and no decisive action. “Let’s have the facts first,” insisted Mr.
Sandy Wadgers. “Let’s be sure we’d be acting perfectly right in bustin’
that there door open. A door onbust is always open to bustin’, but ye
can’t onbust a door once you’ve busted en.”

And suddenly and most wonderfully the door of the room upstairs opened
of its own accord, and as they looked up in amazement, they saw
descending the stairs the muffled figure of the stranger staring more
blackly and blankly than ever with those unreasonably large blue glass
eyes of his. He came down stiffly and slowly, staring all the time; he
walked across the passage staring, then stopped.

“Look there!” he said, and their eyes followed the direction of his
gloved finger and saw a bottle of sarsaparilla hard by the cellar door.
Then he entered the parlour, and suddenly, swiftly, viciously, slammed
the door in their faces.

Not a word was spoken until the last echoes of the slam had died away.
They stared at one another. “Well, if that don’t lick everything!” said
Mr. Wadgers, and left the alternative unsaid.

“I’d go in and ask’n ’bout it,” said Wadgers, to Mr. Hall. “I’d d’mand
an explanation.”

It took some time to bring the landlady’s husband up to that pitch. At
last he rapped, opened the door, and got as far as, “Excuse me—”

“Go to the devil!” said the stranger in a tremendous voice, and “Shut
that door after you.” So that brief interview terminated.




CHAPTER VII.
THE UNVEILING OF THE STRANGER


The stranger went into the little parlour of the “Coach and Horses”
about half-past five in the morning, and there he remained until near
midday, the blinds down, the door shut, and none, after Hall’s repulse,
venturing near him.

All that time he must have fasted. Thrice he rang his bell, the third
time furiously and continuously, but no one answered him. “Him and his
‘go to the devil’ indeed!” said Mrs. Hall. Presently came an imperfect
rumour of the burglary at the vicarage, and two and two were put
together. Hall, assisted by Wadgers, went off to find Mr. Shuckleforth,
the magistrate, and take his advice. No one ventured upstairs. How the
stranger occupied himself is unknown. Now and then he would stride
violently up and down, and twice came an outburst of curses, a tearing
of paper, and a violent smashing of bottles.

The little group of scared but curious people increased. Mrs. Huxter
came over; some gay young fellows resplendent in black ready-made
jackets and _piqué_ paper ties—for it was Whit Monday—joined the group
with confused interrogations. Young Archie Harker distinguished himself
by going up the yard and trying to peep under the window-blinds. He
could see nothing, but gave reason for supposing that he did, and
others of the Iping youth presently joined him.

It was the finest of all possible Whit Mondays, and down the village
street stood a row of nearly a dozen booths, a shooting gallery, and on
the grass by the forge were three yellow and chocolate waggons and some
picturesque strangers of both sexes putting up a cocoanut shy. The
gentlemen wore blue jerseys, the ladies white aprons and quite
fashionable hats with heavy plumes. Wodger, of the “Purple Fawn,” and
Mr. Jaggers, the cobbler, who also sold old second-hand ordinary
bicycles, were stretching a string of union-jacks and royal ensigns
(which had originally celebrated the first Victorian Jubilee) across
the road.

And inside, in the artificial darkness of the parlour, into which only
one thin jet of sunlight penetrated, the stranger, hungry we must
suppose, and fearful, hidden in his uncomfortable hot wrappings, pored
through his dark glasses upon his paper or chinked his dirty little
bottles, and occasionally swore savagely at the boys, audible if
invisible, outside the windows. In the corner by the fireplace lay the
fragments of half a dozen smashed bottles, and a pungent twang of
chlorine tainted the air. So much we know from what was heard at the
time and from what was subsequently seen in the room.

About noon he suddenly opened his parlour door and stood glaring
fixedly at the three or four people in the bar. “Mrs. Hall,” he said.
Somebody went sheepishly and called for Mrs. Hall.

Mrs. Hall appeared after an interval, a little short of breath, but all
the fiercer for that. Hall was still out. She had deliberated over this
scene, and she came holding a little tray with an unsettled bill upon
it. “Is it your bill you’re wanting, sir?” she said.

“Why wasn’t my breakfast laid? Why haven’t you prepared my meals and
answered my bell? Do you think I live without eating?”

“Why isn’t my bill paid?” said Mrs. Hall. “That’s what I want to know.”

“I told you three days ago I was awaiting a remittance—”

“I told you two days ago I wasn’t going to await no remittances. You
can’t grumble if your breakfast waits a bit, if my bill’s been waiting
these five days, can you?”

The stranger swore briefly but vividly.

“Nar, nar!” from the bar.

“And I’d thank you kindly, sir, if you’d keep your swearing to
yourself, sir,” said Mrs. Hall.

The stranger stood looking more like an angry diving-helmet than ever.
It was universally felt in the bar that Mrs. Hall had the better of
him. His next words showed as much.

“Look here, my good woman—” he began.

“Don’t ‘good woman’ _me_,” said Mrs. Hall.

“I’ve told you my remittance hasn’t come.”

“Remittance indeed!” said Mrs. Hall.

“Still, I daresay in my pocket—”

“You told me three days ago that you hadn’t anything but a sovereign’s
worth of silver upon you.”

“Well, I’ve found some more—”

“’Ul-lo!” from the bar.

“I wonder where you found it,” said Mrs. Hall.

That seemed to annoy the stranger very much. He stamped his foot. “What
do you mean?” he said.

“That I wonder where you found it,” said Mrs. Hall. “And before I take
any bills or get any breakfasts, or do any such things whatsoever, you
got to tell me one or two things I don’t understand, and what nobody
don’t understand, and what everybody is very anxious to understand. I
want to know what you been doing t’my chair upstairs, and I want to
know how ’tis your room was empty, and how you got in again. Them as
stops in this house comes in by the doors—that’s the rule of the house,
and that you _didn’t_ do, and what I want to know is how you _did_ come
in. And I want to know—”

Suddenly the stranger raised his gloved hands clenched, stamped his
foot, and said, “Stop!” with such extraordinary violence that he
silenced her instantly.

“You don’t understand,” he said, “who I am or what I am. I’ll show you.
By Heaven! I’ll show you.” Then he put his open palm over his face and
withdrew it. The centre of his face became a black cavity. “Here,” he
said. He stepped forward and handed Mrs. Hall something which she,
staring at his metamorphosed face, accepted automatically. Then, when
she saw what it was, she screamed loudly, dropped it, and staggered
back. The nose—it was the stranger’s nose! pink and shining—rolled on
the floor.

Then he removed his spectacles, and everyone in the bar gasped. He took
off his hat, and with a violent gesture tore at his whiskers and
bandages. For a moment they resisted him. A flash of horrible
anticipation passed through the bar. “Oh, my Gard!” said some one. Then
off they came.

It was worse than anything. Mrs. Hall, standing open-mouthed and
horror-struck, shrieked at what she saw, and made for the door of the
house. Everyone began to move. They were prepared for scars,
disfigurements, tangible horrors, but nothing! The bandages and false
hair flew across the passage into the bar, making a hobbledehoy jump to
avoid them. Everyone tumbled on everyone else down the steps. For the
man who stood there shouting some incoherent explanation, was a solid
gesticulating figure up to the coat-collar of him, and
then—nothingness, no visible thing at all!

People down the village heard shouts and shrieks, and looking up the
street saw the “Coach and Horses” violently firing out its humanity.
They saw Mrs. Hall fall down and Mr. Teddy Henfrey jump to avoid
tumbling over her, and then they heard the frightful screams of Millie,
who, emerging suddenly from the kitchen at the noise of the tumult, had
come upon the headless stranger from behind. These increased suddenly.

Forthwith everyone all down the street, the sweetstuff seller, cocoanut
shy proprietor and his assistant, the swing man, little boys and girls,
rustic dandies, smart wenches, smocked elders and aproned gipsies—began
running towards the inn, and in a miraculously short space of time a
crowd of perhaps forty people, and rapidly increasing, swayed and
hooted and inquired and exclaimed and suggested, in front of Mrs.
Hall’s establishment. Everyone seemed eager to talk at once, and the
result was Babel. A small group supported Mrs. Hall, who was picked up
in a state of collapse. There was a conference, and the incredible
evidence of a vociferous eye-witness. “O Bogey!” “What’s he been doin’,
then?” “Ain’t hurt the girl, ’as ’e?” “Run at en with a knife, I
believe.” “No ’ed, I tell ye. I don’t mean no manner of speaking. I
mean _marn ’ithout a ’ed_!” “Narnsense! ’tis some conjuring trick.”
“Fetched off ’is wrapping, ’e did—”

In its struggles to see in through the open door, the crowd formed
itself into a straggling wedge, with the more adventurous apex nearest
the inn. “He stood for a moment, I heerd the gal scream, and he turned.
I saw her skirts whisk, and he went after her. Didn’t take ten seconds.
Back he comes with a knife in uz hand and a loaf; stood just as if he
was staring. Not a moment ago. Went in that there door. I tell ’e, ’e
ain’t gart no ’ed at all. You just missed en—”

There was a disturbance behind, and the speaker stopped to step aside
for a little procession that was marching very resolutely towards the
house; first Mr. Hall, very red and determined, then Mr. Bobby Jaffers,
the village constable, and then the wary Mr. Wadgers. They had come now
armed with a warrant.

People shouted conflicting information of the recent circumstances.
“’Ed or no ’ed,” said Jaffers, “I got to ’rest en, and ’rest en I
_will_.”

Mr. Hall marched up the steps, marched straight to the door of the
parlour and flung it open. “Constable,” he said, “do your duty.”

Jaffers marched in. Hall next, Wadgers last. They saw in the dim light
the headless figure facing them, with a gnawed crust of bread in one
gloved hand and a chunk of cheese in the other.

“That’s him!” said Hall.

“What the devil’s this?” came in a tone of angry expostulation from
above the collar of the figure.

“You’re a damned rum customer, mister,” said Mr. Jaffers. “But ’ed or
no ’ed, the warrant says ‘body,’ and duty’s duty—”

“Keep off!” said the figure, starting back.

Abruptly he whipped down the bread and cheese, and Mr. Hall just
grasped the knife on the table in time to save it. Off came the
stranger’s left glove and was slapped in Jaffers’ face. In another
moment Jaffers, cutting short some statement concerning a warrant, had
gripped him by the handless wrist and caught his invisible throat. He
got a sounding kick on the shin that made him shout, but he kept his
grip. Hall sent the knife sliding along the table to Wadgers, who acted
as goal-keeper for the offensive, so to speak, and then stepped forward
as Jaffers and the stranger swayed and staggered towards him, clutching
and hitting in. A chair stood in the way, and went aside with a crash
as they came down together.

“Get the feet,” said Jaffers between his teeth.

Mr. Hall, endeavouring to act on instructions, received a sounding kick
in the ribs that disposed of him for a moment, and Mr. Wadgers, seeing
the decapitated stranger had rolled over and got the upper side of
Jaffers, retreated towards the door, knife in hand, and so collided
with Mr. Huxter and the Sidderbridge carter coming to the rescue of law
and order. At the same moment down came three or four bottles from the
chiffonnier and shot a web of pungency into the air of the room.

“I’ll surrender,” cried the stranger, though he had Jaffers down, and
in another moment he stood up panting, a strange figure, headless and
handless—for he had pulled off his right glove now as well as his left.
“It’s no good,” he said, as if sobbing for breath.

It was the strangest thing in the world to hear that voice coming as if
out of empty space, but the Sussex peasants are perhaps the most
matter-of-fact people under the sun. Jaffers got up also and produced a
pair of handcuffs. Then he stared.

“I say!” said Jaffers, brought up short by a dim realization of the
incongruity of the whole business, “Darn it! Can’t use ’em as I can
see.”

The stranger ran his arm down his waistcoat, and as if by a miracle the
buttons to which his empty sleeve pointed became undone. Then he said
something about his shin, and stooped down. He seemed to be fumbling
with his shoes and socks.

“Why!” said Huxter, suddenly, “that’s not a man at all. It’s just empty
clothes. Look! You can see down his collar and the linings of his
clothes. I could put my arm—”

He extended his hand; it seemed to meet something in mid-air, and he
drew it back with a sharp exclamation. “I wish you’d keep your fingers
out of my eye,” said the aerial voice, in a tone of savage
expostulation. “The fact is, I’m all here—head, hands, legs, and all
the rest of it, but it happens I’m invisible. It’s a confounded
nuisance, but I am. That’s no reason why I should be poked to pieces by
every stupid bumpkin in Iping, is it?”

The suit of clothes, now all unbuttoned and hanging loosely upon its
unseen supports, stood up, arms akimbo.

Several other of the men folks had now entered the room, so that it was
closely crowded. “Invisible, eh?” said Huxter, ignoring the stranger’s
abuse. “Who ever heard the likes of that?”

“It’s strange, perhaps, but it’s not a crime. Why am I assaulted by a
policeman in this fashion?”

“Ah! that’s a different matter,” said Jaffers. “No doubt you are a bit
difficult to see in this light, but I got a warrant and it’s all
correct. What I’m after ain’t no invisibility,—it’s burglary. There’s a
house been broke into and money took.”

“Well?”

“And circumstances certainly point—”

“Stuff and nonsense!” said the Invisible Man.

“I hope so, sir; but I’ve got my instructions.”

“Well,” said the stranger, “I’ll come. I’ll _come_. But no handcuffs.”

“It’s the regular thing,” said Jaffers.

“No handcuffs,” stipulated the stranger.

“Pardon me,” said Jaffers.

Abruptly the figure sat down, and before any one could realise was was
being done, the slippers, socks, and trousers had been kicked off under
the table. Then he sprang up again and flung off his coat.

“Here, stop that,” said Jaffers, suddenly realising what was happening.
He gripped at the waistcoat; it struggled, and the shirt slipped out of
it and left it limp and empty in his hand. “Hold him!” said Jaffers,
loudly. “Once he gets the things off—”

“Hold him!” cried everyone, and there was a rush at the fluttering
white shirt which was now all that was visible of the stranger.

The shirt-sleeve planted a shrewd blow in Hall’s face that stopped his
open-armed advance, and sent him backward into old Toothsome the
sexton, and in another moment the garment was lifted up and became
convulsed and vacantly flapping about the arms, even as a shirt that is
being thrust over a man’s head. Jaffers clutched at it, and only helped
to pull it off; he was struck in the mouth out of the air, and
incontinently threw his truncheon and smote Teddy Henfrey savagely upon
the crown of his head.

“Look out!” said everybody, fencing at random and hitting at nothing.
“Hold him! Shut the door! Don’t let him loose! I got something! Here he
is!” A perfect Babel of noises they made. Everybody, it seemed, was
being hit all at once, and Sandy Wadgers, knowing as ever and his wits
sharpened by a frightful blow in the nose, reopened the door and led
the rout. The others, following incontinently, were jammed for a moment
in the corner by the doorway. The hitting continued. Phipps, the
Unitarian, had a front tooth broken, and Henfrey was injured in the
cartilage of his ear. Jaffers was struck under the jaw, and, turning,
caught at something that intervened between him and Huxter in the
mêlée, and prevented their coming together. He felt a muscular chest,
and in another moment the whole mass of struggling, excited men shot
out into the crowded hall.

“I got him!” shouted Jaffers, choking and reeling through them all, and
wrestling with purple face and swelling veins against his unseen enemy.

Men staggered right and left as the extraordinary conflict swayed
swiftly towards the house door, and went spinning down the half-dozen
steps of the inn. Jaffers cried in a strangled voice—holding tight,
nevertheless, and making play with his knee—spun around, and fell
heavily undermost with his head on the gravel. Only then did his
fingers relax.

There were excited cries of “Hold him!” “Invisible!” and so forth, and
a young fellow, a stranger in the place whose name did not come to
light, rushed in at once, caught something, missed his hold, and fell
over the constable’s prostrate body. Half-way across the road a woman
screamed as something pushed by her; a dog, kicked apparently, yelped
and ran howling into Huxter’s yard, and with that the transit of the
Invisible Man was accomplished. For a space people stood amazed and
gesticulating, and then came panic, and scattered them abroad through
the village as a gust scatters dead leaves.

But Jaffers lay quite still, face upward and knees bent, at the foot of
the steps of the inn.




CHAPTER VIII.
IN TRANSIT


The eighth chapter is exceedingly brief, and relates that Gibbons, the
amateur naturalist of the district, while lying out on the spacious
open downs without a soul within a couple of miles of him, as he
thought, and almost dozing, heard close to him the sound as of a man
coughing, sneezing, and then swearing savagely to himself; and looking,
beheld nothing. Yet the voice was indisputable. It continued to swear
with that breadth and variety that distinguishes the swearing of a
cultivated man. It grew to a climax, diminished again, and died away in
the distance, going as it seemed to him in the direction of Adderdean.
It lifted to a spasmodic sneeze and ended. Gibbons had heard nothing of
the morning’s occurrences, but the phenomenon was so striking and
disturbing that his philosophical tranquillity vanished; he got up
hastily, and hurried down the steepness of the hill towards the
village, as fast as he could go.




CHAPTER IX.
MR. THOMAS MARVEL


You must picture Mr. Thomas Marvel as a person of copious, flexible
visage, a nose of cylindrical protrusion, a liquorish, ample,
fluctuating mouth, and a beard of bristling eccentricity. His figure
inclined to embonpoint; his short limbs accentuated this inclination.
He wore a furry silk hat, and the frequent substitution of twine and
shoe-laces for buttons, apparent at critical points of his costume,
marked a man essentially bachelor.

Mr. Thomas Marvel was sitting with his feet in a ditch by the roadside
over the down towards Adderdean, about a mile and a half out of Iping.
His feet, save for socks of irregular open-work, were bare, his big
toes were broad, and pricked like the ears of a watchful dog. In a
leisurely manner—he did everything in a leisurely manner—he was
contemplating trying on a pair of boots. They were the soundest boots
he had come across for a long time, but too large for him; whereas the
ones he had were, in dry weather, a very comfortable fit, but too
thin-soled for damp. Mr. Thomas Marvel hated roomy shoes, but then he
hated damp. He had never properly thought out which he hated most, and
it was a pleasant day, and there was nothing better to do. So he put
the four shoes in a graceful group on the turf and looked at them. And
seeing them there among the grass and springing agrimony, it suddenly
occurred to him that both pairs were exceedingly ugly to see. He was
not at all startled by a voice behind him.

“They’re boots, anyhow,” said the Voice.

“They are—charity boots,” said Mr. Thomas Marvel, with his head on one
side regarding them distastefully; “and which is the ugliest pair in
the whole blessed universe, I’m darned if I know!”

“H’m,” said the Voice.

“I’ve worn worse—in fact, I’ve worn none. But none so owdacious ugly—if
you’ll allow the expression. I’ve been cadging boots—in particular—for
days. Because I was sick of _them_. They’re sound enough, of course.
But a gentleman on tramp sees such a thundering lot of his boots. And
if you’ll believe me, I’ve raised nothing in the whole blessed country,
try as I would, but _them_. Look at ’em! And a good country for boots,
too, in a general way. But it’s just my promiscuous luck. I’ve got my
boots in this country ten years or more. And then they treat you like
this.”

“It’s a beast of a country,” said the Voice. “And pigs for people.”

“Ain’t it?” said Mr. Thomas Marvel. “Lord! But them boots! It beats
it.”

He turned his head over his shoulder to the right, to look at the boots
of his interlocutor with a view to comparisons, and lo! where the boots
of his interlocutor should have been were neither legs nor boots. He
was irradiated by the dawn of a great amazement. “Where _are_ yer?”
said Mr. Thomas Marvel over his shoulder and coming on all fours. He
saw a stretch of empty downs with the wind swaying the remote
green-pointed furze bushes.

“Am I drunk?” said Mr. Marvel. “Have I had visions? Was I talking to
myself? What the—”

“Don’t be alarmed,” said a Voice.

“None of your ventriloquising _me_,” said Mr. Thomas Marvel, rising
sharply to his feet. “Where _are_ yer? Alarmed, indeed!”

“Don’t be alarmed,” repeated the Voice.

“_You’ll_ be alarmed in a minute, you silly fool,” said Mr. Thomas
Marvel. “Where _are_ yer? Lemme get my mark on yer...

“Are yer _buried_?” said Mr. Thomas Marvel, after an interval.

There was no answer. Mr. Thomas Marvel stood bootless and amazed, his
jacket nearly thrown off.

“Peewit,” said a peewit, very remote.

“Peewit, indeed!” said Mr. Thomas Marvel. “This ain’t no time for
foolery.” The down was desolate, east and west, north and south; the
road with its shallow ditches and white bordering stakes, ran smooth
and empty north and south, and, save for that peewit, the blue sky was
empty too. “So help me,” said Mr. Thomas Marvel, shuffling his coat on
to his shoulders again. “It’s the drink! I might ha’ known.”

“It’s not the drink,” said the Voice. “You keep your nerves steady.”

“Ow!” said Mr. Marvel, and his face grew white amidst its patches.
“It’s the drink!” his lips repeated noiselessly. He remained staring
about him, rotating slowly backwards. “I could have _swore_ I heard a
voice,” he whispered.

“Of course you did.”

“It’s there again,” said Mr. Marvel, closing his eyes and clasping his
hand on his brow with a tragic gesture. He was suddenly taken by the
collar and shaken violently, and left more dazed than ever. “Don’t be a
fool,” said the Voice.

“I’m—off—my—blooming—chump,” said Mr. Marvel. “It’s no good. It’s
fretting about them blarsted boots. I’m off my blessed blooming chump.
Or it’s spirits.”

“Neither one thing nor the other,” said the Voice. “Listen!”

“Chump,” said Mr. Marvel.

“One minute,” said the Voice, penetratingly, tremulous with
self-control.

“Well?” said Mr. Thomas Marvel, with a strange feeling of having been
dug in the chest by a finger.

“You think I’m just imagination? Just imagination?”

“What else _can_ you be?” said Mr. Thomas Marvel, rubbing the back of
his neck.

“Very well,” said the Voice, in a tone of relief. “Then I’m going to
throw flints at you till you think differently.”

“But where _are_ yer?”

The Voice made no answer. Whizz came a flint, apparently out of the
air, and missed Mr. Marvel’s shoulder by a hair’s-breadth. Mr. Marvel,
turning, saw a flint jerk up into the air, trace a complicated path,
hang for a moment, and then fling at his feet with almost invisible
rapidity. He was too amazed to dodge. Whizz it came, and ricochetted
from a bare toe into the ditch. Mr. Thomas Marvel jumped a foot and
howled aloud. Then he started to run, tripped over an unseen obstacle,
and came head over heels into a sitting position.

“_Now_,” said the Voice, as a third stone curved upward and hung in the
air above the tramp. “Am I imagination?”

Mr. Marvel by way of reply struggled to his feet, and was immediately
rolled over again. He lay quiet for a moment. “If you struggle any
more,” said the Voice, “I shall throw the flint at your head.”

“It’s a fair do,” said Mr. Thomas Marvel, sitting up, taking his
wounded toe in hand and fixing his eye on the third missile. “I don’t
understand it. Stones flinging themselves. Stones talking. Put yourself
down. Rot away. I’m done.”

The third flint fell.

“It’s very simple,” said the Voice. “I’m an invisible man.”

“Tell us something I don’t know,” said Mr. Marvel, gasping with pain.
“Where you’ve hid—how you do it—I _don’t_ know. I’m beat.”

“That’s all,” said the Voice. “I’m invisible. That’s what I want you to
understand.”

“Anyone could see that. There is no need for you to be so confounded
impatient, mister. _Now_ then. Give us a notion. How are you hid?”

“I’m invisible. That’s the great point. And what I want you to
understand is this—”

“But whereabouts?” interrupted Mr. Marvel.

“Here! Six yards in front of you.”

“Oh, _come_! I ain’t blind. You’ll be telling me next you’re just thin
air. I’m not one of your ignorant tramps—”

“Yes, I am—thin air. You’re looking through me.”

“What! Ain’t there any stuff to you. _Vox et_—what is it?—jabber. Is it
that?”

“I am just a human being—solid, needing food and drink, needing
covering too—But I’m invisible. You see? Invisible. Simple idea.
Invisible.”

“What, real like?”

“Yes, real.”

“Let’s have a hand of you,” said Marvel, “if you _are_ real. It won’t
be so darn out-of-the-way like, then—_Lord_!” he said, “how you made me
jump!—gripping me like that!”

He felt the hand that had closed round his wrist with his disengaged
fingers, and his fingers went timorously up the arm, patted a muscular
chest, and explored a bearded face. Marvel’s face was astonishment.

“I’m dashed!” he said. “If this don’t beat cock-fighting! Most
remarkable!—And there I can see a rabbit clean through you, ’arf a mile
away! Not a bit of you visible—except—”

He scrutinised the apparently empty space keenly. “You ’aven’t been
eatin’ bread and cheese?” he asked, holding the invisible arm.

“You’re quite right, and it’s not quite assimilated into the system.”

“Ah!” said Mr. Marvel. “Sort of ghostly, though.”

“Of course, all this isn’t half so wonderful as you think.”

“It’s quite wonderful enough for _my_ modest wants,” said Mr. Thomas
Marvel. “Howjer manage it! How the dooce is it done?”

“It’s too long a story. And besides—”

“I tell you, the whole business fairly beats me,” said Mr. Marvel.

“What I want to say at present is this: I need help. I have come to
that—I came upon you suddenly. I was wandering, mad with rage, naked,
impotent. I could have murdered. And I saw you—”

“_Lord_!” said Mr. Marvel.

“I came up behind you—hesitated—went on—”

Mr. Marvel’s expression was eloquent.

“—then stopped. ‘Here,’ I said, ‘is an outcast like myself. This is the
man for me.’ So I turned back and came to you—you. And—”

“_Lord_!” said Mr. Marvel. “But I’m all in a tizzy. May I ask—How is
it? And what you may be requiring in the way of help?—Invisible!”

“I want you to help me get clothes—and shelter—and then, with other
things. I’ve left them long enough. If you won’t—well! But you
_will—must_.”

“Look here,” said Mr. Marvel. “I’m too flabbergasted. Don’t knock me
about any more. And leave me go. I must get steady a bit. And you’ve
pretty near broken my toe. It’s all so unreasonable. Empty downs, empty
sky. Nothing visible for miles except the bosom of Nature. And then
comes a voice. A voice out of heaven! And stones! And a fist—Lord!”

“Pull yourself together,” said the Voice, “for you have to do the job
I’ve chosen for you.”

Mr. Marvel blew out his cheeks, and his eyes were round.

“I’ve chosen you,” said the Voice. “You are the only man except some of
those fools down there, who knows there is such a thing as an invisible
man. You have to be my helper. Help me—and I will do great things for
you. An invisible man is a man of power.” He stopped for a moment to
sneeze violently.

“But if you betray me,” he said, “if you fail to do as I direct you—”
He paused and tapped Mr. Marvel’s shoulder smartly. Mr. Marvel gave a
yelp of terror at the touch. “I don’t want to betray you,” said Mr.
Marvel, edging away from the direction of the fingers. “Don’t you go
a-thinking that, whatever you do. All I want to do is to help you—just
tell me what I got to do. (Lord!) Whatever you want done, that I’m most
willing to do.”




CHAPTER X.
MR. MARVEL’S VISIT TO IPING


After the first gusty panic had spent itself Iping became
argumentative. Scepticism suddenly reared its head—rather nervous
scepticism, not at all assured of its back, but scepticism
nevertheless. It is so much easier not to believe in an invisible man;
and those who had actually seen him dissolve into air, or felt the
strength of his arm, could be counted on the fingers of two hands. And
of these witnesses Mr. Wadgers was presently missing, having retired
impregnably behind the bolts and bars of his own house, and Jaffers was
lying stunned in the parlour of the “Coach and Horses.” Great and
strange ideas transcending experience often have less effect upon men
and women than smaller, more tangible considerations. Iping was gay
with bunting, and everybody was in gala dress. Whit Monday had been
looked forward to for a month or more. By the afternoon even those who
believed in the Unseen were beginning to resume their little amusements
in a tentative fashion, on the supposition that he had quite gone away,
and with the sceptics he was already a jest. But people, sceptics and
believers alike, were remarkably sociable all that day.

Haysman’s meadow was gay with a tent, in which Mrs. Bunting and other
ladies were preparing tea, while, without, the Sunday-school children
ran races and played games under the noisy guidance of the curate and
the Misses Cuss and Sackbut. No doubt there was a slight uneasiness in
the air, but people for the most part had the sense to conceal whatever
imaginative qualms they experienced. On the village green an inclined
strong [rope?], down which, clinging the while to a pulley-swung
handle, one could be hurled violently against a sack at the other end,
came in for considerable favour among the adolescents, as also did the
swings and the cocoanut shies. There was also promenading, and the
steam organ attached to a small roundabout filled the air with a
pungent flavour of oil and with equally pungent music. Members of the
club, who had attended church in the morning, were splendid in badges
of pink and green, and some of the gayer-minded had also adorned their
bowler hats with brilliant-coloured favours of ribbon. Old Fletcher,
whose conceptions of holiday-making were severe, was visible through
the jasmine about his window or through the open door (whichever way
you chose to look), poised delicately on a plank supported on two
chairs, and whitewashing the ceiling of his front room.

About four o’clock a stranger entered the village from the direction of
the downs. He was a short, stout person in an extraordinarily shabby
top hat, and he appeared to be very much out of breath. His cheeks were
alternately limp and tightly puffed. His mottled face was apprehensive,
and he moved with a sort of reluctant alacrity. He turned the corner of
the church, and directed his way to the “Coach and Horses.” Among
others old Fletcher remembers seeing him, and indeed the old gentleman
was so struck by his peculiar agitation that he inadvertently allowed a
quantity of whitewash to run down the brush into the sleeve of his coat
while regarding him.

This stranger, to the perceptions of the proprietor of the cocoanut
shy, appeared to be talking to himself, and Mr. Huxter remarked the
same thing. He stopped at the foot of the “Coach and Horses” steps,
and, according to Mr. Huxter, appeared to undergo a severe internal
struggle before he could induce himself to enter the house. Finally he
marched up the steps, and was seen by Mr. Huxter to turn to the left
and open the door of the parlour. Mr. Huxter heard voices from within
the room and from the bar apprising the man of his error. “That room’s
private!” said Hall, and the stranger shut the door clumsily and went
into the bar.

In the course of a few minutes he reappeared, wiping his lips with the
back of his hand with an air of quiet satisfaction that somehow
impressed Mr. Huxter as assumed. He stood looking about him for some
moments, and then Mr. Huxter saw him walk in an oddly furtive manner
towards the gates of the yard, upon which the parlour window opened.
The stranger, after some hesitation, leant against one of the
gate-posts, produced a short clay pipe, and prepared to fill it. His
fingers trembled while doing so. He lit it clumsily, and folding his
arms began to smoke in a languid attitude, an attitude which his
occasional glances up the yard altogether belied.

All this Mr. Huxter saw over the canisters of the tobacco window, and
the singularity of the man’s behaviour prompted him to maintain his
observation.

Presently the stranger stood up abruptly and put his pipe in his
pocket. Then he vanished into the yard. Forthwith Mr. Huxter,
conceiving he was witness of some petty larceny, leapt round his
counter and ran out into the road to intercept the thief. As he did so,
Mr. Marvel reappeared, his hat askew, a big bundle in a blue
table-cloth in one hand, and three books tied together—as it proved
afterwards with the Vicar’s braces—in the other. Directly he saw Huxter
he gave a sort of gasp, and turning sharply to the left, began to run.
“Stop, thief!” cried Huxter, and set off after him. Mr. Huxter’s
sensations were vivid but brief. He saw the man just before him and
spurting briskly for the church corner and the hill road. He saw the
village flags and festivities beyond, and a face or so turned towards
him. He bawled, “Stop!” again. He had hardly gone ten strides before
his shin was caught in some mysterious fashion, and he was no longer
running, but flying with inconceivable rapidity through the air. He saw
the ground suddenly close to his face. The world seemed to splash into
a million whirling specks of light, and subsequent proceedings
interested him no more.




CHAPTER XI.
IN THE “COACH AND HORSES”


Now in order clearly to understand what had happened in the inn, it is
necessary to go back to the moment when Mr. Marvel first came into view
of Mr. Huxter’s window.

At that precise moment Mr. Cuss and Mr. Bunting were in the parlour.
They were seriously investigating the strange occurrences of the
morning, and were, with Mr. Hall’s permission, making a thorough
examination of the Invisible Man’s belongings. Jaffers had partially
recovered from his fall and had gone home in the charge of his
sympathetic friends. The stranger’s scattered garments had been removed
by Mrs. Hall and the room tidied up. And on the table under the window
where the stranger had been wont to work, Cuss had hit almost at once
on three big books in manuscript labelled “Diary.”

“Diary!” said Cuss, putting the three books on the table. “Now, at any
rate, we shall learn something.” The Vicar stood with his hands on the
table.

“Diary,” repeated Cuss, sitting down, putting two volumes to support
the third, and opening it. “H’m—no name on the fly-leaf.
Bother!—cypher. And figures.”

The vicar came round to look over his shoulder.

Cuss turned the pages over with a face suddenly disappointed. “I’m—dear
me! It’s all cypher, Bunting.”

“There are no diagrams?” asked Mr. Bunting. “No illustrations throwing
light—”

“See for yourself,” said Mr. Cuss. “Some of it’s mathematical and some
of it’s Russian or some such language (to judge by the letters), and
some of it’s Greek. Now the Greek I thought _you_—”

“Of course,” said Mr. Bunting, taking out and wiping his spectacles and
feeling suddenly very uncomfortable—for he had no Greek left in his
mind worth talking about; “yes—the Greek, of course, may furnish a
clue.”

“I’ll find you a place.”

“I’d rather glance through the volumes first,” said Mr. Bunting, still
wiping. “A general impression first, Cuss, and _then_, you know, we can
go looking for clues.”

He coughed, put on his glasses, arranged them fastidiously, coughed
again, and wished something would happen to avert the seemingly
inevitable exposure. Then he took the volume Cuss handed him in a
leisurely manner. And then something did happen.

The door opened suddenly.

Both gentlemen started violently, looked round, and were relieved to
see a sporadically rosy face beneath a furry silk hat. “Tap?” asked the
face, and stood staring.

“No,” said both gentlemen at once.

“Over the other side, my man,” said Mr. Bunting. And “Please shut that
door,” said Mr. Cuss, irritably.

“All right,” said the intruder, as it seemed in a low voice curiously
different from the huskiness of its first inquiry. “Right you are,”
said the intruder in the former voice. “Stand clear!” and he vanished
and closed the door.

“A sailor, I should judge,” said Mr. Bunting. “Amusing fellows, they
are. Stand clear! indeed. A nautical term, referring to his getting
back out of the room, I suppose.”

“I daresay so,” said Cuss. “My nerves are all loose to-day. It quite
made me jump—the door opening like that.”

Mr. Bunting smiled as if he had not jumped. “And now,” he said with a
sigh, “these books.”

Someone sniffed as he did so.

“One thing is indisputable,” said Bunting, drawing up a chair next to
that of Cuss. “There certainly have been very strange things happen in
Iping during the last few days—very strange. I cannot of course believe
in this absurd invisibility story—”

“It’s incredible,” said Cuss—“incredible. But the fact remains that I
saw—I certainly saw right down his sleeve—”

“But did you—are you sure? Suppose a mirror, for instance—
hallucinations are so easily produced. I don’t know if you have ever
seen a really good conjuror—”

“I won’t argue again,” said Cuss. “We’ve thrashed that out, Bunting.
And just now there’s these books—Ah! here’s some of what I take to be
Greek! Greek letters certainly.”

He pointed to the middle of the page. Mr. Bunting flushed slightly and
brought his face nearer, apparently finding some difficulty with his
glasses. Suddenly he became aware of a strange feeling at the nape of
his neck. He tried to raise his head, and encountered an immovable
resistance. The feeling was a curious pressure, the grip of a heavy,
firm hand, and it bore his chin irresistibly to the table. “Don’t move,
little men,” whispered a voice, “or I’ll brain you both!” He looked
into the face of Cuss, close to his own, and each saw a horrified
reflection of his own sickly astonishment.

“I’m sorry to handle you so roughly,” said the Voice, “but it’s
unavoidable.”

“Since when did you learn to pry into an investigator’s private
memoranda,” said the Voice; and two chins struck the table
simultaneously, and two sets of teeth rattled.

“Since when did you learn to invade the private rooms of a man in
misfortune?” and the concussion was repeated.

“Where have they put my clothes?”

“Listen,” said the Voice. “The windows are fastened and I’ve taken the
key out of the door. I am a fairly strong man, and I have the poker
handy—besides being invisible. There’s not the slightest doubt that I
could kill you both and get away quite easily if I wanted to—do you
understand? Very well. If I let you go will you promise not to try any
nonsense and do what I tell you?”

The vicar and the doctor looked at one another, and the doctor pulled a
face. “Yes,” said Mr. Bunting, and the doctor repeated it. Then the
pressure on the necks relaxed, and the doctor and the vicar sat up,
both very red in the face and wriggling their heads.

“Please keep sitting where you are,” said the Invisible Man. “Here’s
the poker, you see.”

“When I came into this room,” continued the Invisible Man, after
presenting the poker to the tip of the nose of each of his visitors, “I
did not expect to find it occupied, and I expected to find, in addition
to my books of memoranda, an outfit of clothing. Where is it? No—don’t
rise. I can see it’s gone. Now, just at present, though the days are
quite warm enough for an invisible man to run about stark, the evenings
are quite chilly. I want clothing—and other accommodation; and I must
also have those three books.”




CHAPTER XII.
THE INVISIBLE MAN LOSES HIS TEMPER


It is unavoidable that at this point the narrative should break off
again, for a certain very painful reason that will presently be
apparent. While these things were going on in the parlour, and while
Mr. Huxter was watching Mr. Marvel smoking his pipe against the gate,
not a dozen yards away were Mr. Hall and Teddy Henfrey discussing in a
state of cloudy puzzlement the one Iping topic.

Suddenly there came a violent thud against the door of the parlour, a
sharp cry, and then—silence.

“Hul-lo!” said Teddy Henfrey.

“Hul-lo!” from the Tap.

Mr. Hall took things in slowly but surely. “That ain’t right,” he said,
and came round from behind the bar towards the parlour door.

He and Teddy approached the door together, with intent faces. Their
eyes considered. “Summat wrong,” said Hall, and Henfrey nodded
agreement. Whiffs of an unpleasant chemical odour met them, and there
was a muffled sound of conversation, very rapid and subdued.

“You all right thur?” asked Hall, rapping.

The muttered conversation ceased abruptly, for a moment silence, then
the conversation was resumed, in hissing whispers, then a sharp cry of
“No! no, you don’t!” There came a sudden motion and the oversetting of
a chair, a brief struggle. Silence again.

“What the dooce?” exclaimed Henfrey, _sotto voce_.

“You—all—right thur?” asked Mr. Hall, sharply, again.

The Vicar’s voice answered with a curious jerking intonation: “Quite
ri-right. Please don’t—interrupt.”

“Odd!” said Mr. Henfrey.

“Odd!” said Mr. Hall.

“Says, ‘Don’t interrupt,’” said Henfrey.

“I heerd’n,” said Hall.

“And a sniff,” said Henfrey.

They remained listening. The conversation was rapid and subdued. “I
_can’t_,” said Mr. Bunting, his voice rising; “I tell you, sir, I
_will_ not.”

“What was that?” asked Henfrey.

“Says he wi’ nart,” said Hall. “Warn’t speaking to us, wuz he?”

“Disgraceful!” said Mr. Bunting, within.

“‘Disgraceful,’” said Mr. Henfrey. “I heard it—distinct.”

“Who’s that speaking now?” asked Henfrey.

“Mr. Cuss, I s’pose,” said Hall. “Can you hear—anything?”

Silence. The sounds within indistinct and perplexing.

“Sounds like throwing the table-cloth about,” said Hall.

Mrs. Hall appeared behind the bar. Hall made gestures of silence and
invitation. This aroused Mrs. Hall’s wifely opposition. “What yer
listenin’ there for, Hall?” she asked. “Ain’t you nothin’ better to
do—busy day like this?”

Hall tried to convey everything by grimaces and dumb show, but Mrs.
Hall was obdurate. She raised her voice. So Hall and Henfrey, rather
crestfallen, tiptoed back to the bar, gesticulating to explain to her.

At first she refused to see anything in what they had heard at all.
Then she insisted on Hall keeping silence, while Henfrey told her his
story. She was inclined to think the whole business nonsense—perhaps
they were just moving the furniture about. “I heerd’n say
‘disgraceful’; _that_ I did,” said Hall.

“_I_ heerd that, Mrs. Hall,” said Henfrey.

“Like as not—” began Mrs. Hall.

“Hsh!” said Mr. Teddy Henfrey. “Didn’t I hear the window?”

“What window?” asked Mrs. Hall.

“Parlour window,” said Henfrey.

Everyone stood listening intently. Mrs. Hall’s eyes, directed straight
before her, saw without seeing the brilliant oblong of the inn door,
the road white and vivid, and Huxter’s shop-front blistering in the
June sun. Abruptly Huxter’s door opened and Huxter appeared, eyes
staring with excitement, arms gesticulating. “Yap!” cried Huxter. “Stop
thief!” and he ran obliquely across the oblong towards the yard gates,
and vanished.

Simultaneously came a tumult from the parlour, and a sound of windows
being closed.

Hall, Henfrey, and the human contents of the tap rushed out at once
pell-mell into the street. They saw someone whisk round the corner
towards the road, and Mr. Huxter executing a complicated leap in the
air that ended on his face and shoulder. Down the street people were
standing astonished or running towards them.

Mr. Huxter was stunned. Henfrey stopped to discover this, but Hall and
the two labourers from the Tap rushed at once to the corner, shouting
incoherent things, and saw Mr. Marvel vanishing by the corner of the
church wall. They appear to have jumped to the impossible conclusion
that this was the Invisible Man suddenly become visible, and set off at
once along the lane in pursuit. But Hall had hardly run a dozen yards
before he gave a loud shout of astonishment and went flying headlong
sideways, clutching one of the labourers and bringing him to the
ground. He had been charged just as one charges a man at football. The
second labourer came round in a circle, stared, and conceiving that
Hall had tumbled over of his own accord, turned to resume the pursuit,
only to be tripped by the ankle just as Huxter had been. Then, as the
first labourer struggled to his feet, he was kicked sideways by a blow
that might have felled an ox.

As he went down, the rush from the direction of the village green came
round the corner. The first to appear was the proprietor of the
cocoanut shy, a burly man in a blue jersey. He was astonished to see
the lane empty save for three men sprawling absurdly on the ground. And
then something happened to his rear-most foot, and he went headlong and
rolled sideways just in time to graze the feet of his brother and
partner, following headlong. The two were then kicked, knelt on, fallen
over, and cursed by quite a number of over-hasty people.

Now when Hall and Henfrey and the labourers ran out of the house, Mrs.
Hall, who had been disciplined by years of experience, remained in the
bar next the till. And suddenly the parlour door was opened, and Mr.
Cuss appeared, and without glancing at her rushed at once down the
steps toward the corner. “Hold him!” he cried. “Don’t let him drop that
parcel.”

He knew nothing of the existence of Marvel. For the Invisible Man had
handed over the books and bundle in the yard. The face of Mr. Cuss was
angry and resolute, but his costume was defective, a sort of limp white
kilt that could only have passed muster in Greece. “Hold him!” he
bawled. “He’s got my trousers! And every stitch of the Vicar’s
clothes!”

“’Tend to him in a minute!” he cried to Henfrey as he passed the
prostrate Huxter, and, coming round the corner to join the tumult, was
promptly knocked off his feet into an indecorous sprawl. Somebody in
full flight trod heavily on his finger. He yelled, struggled to regain
his feet, was knocked against and thrown on all fours again, and became
aware that he was involved not in a capture, but a rout. Everyone was
running back to the village. He rose again and was hit severely behind
the ear. He staggered and set off back to the “Coach and Horses”
forthwith, leaping over the deserted Huxter, who was now sitting up, on
his way.

Behind him as he was halfway up the inn steps he heard a sudden yell of
rage, rising sharply out of the confusion of cries, and a sounding
smack in someone’s face. He recognised the voice as that of the
Invisible Man, and the note was that of a man suddenly infuriated by a
painful blow.

In another moment Mr. Cuss was back in the parlour. “He’s coming back,
Bunting!” he said, rushing in. “Save yourself!”

Mr. Bunting was standing in the window engaged in an attempt to clothe
himself in the hearth-rug and a _West Surrey Gazette_. “Who’s coming?”
he said, so startled that his costume narrowly escaped disintegration.

“Invisible Man,” said Cuss, and rushed on to the window. “We’d better
clear out from here! He’s fighting mad! Mad!”

In another moment he was out in the yard.

“Good heavens!” said Mr. Bunting, hesitating between two horrible
alternatives. He heard a frightful struggle in the passage of the inn,
and his decision was made. He clambered out of the window, adjusted his
costume hastily, and fled up the village as fast as his fat little legs
would carry him.

From the moment when the Invisible Man screamed with rage and Mr.
Bunting made his memorable flight up the village, it became impossible
to give a consecutive account of affairs in Iping. Possibly the
Invisible Man’s original intention was simply to cover Marvel’s retreat
with the clothes and books. But his temper, at no time very good, seems
to have gone completely at some chance blow, and forthwith he set to
smiting and overthrowing, for the mere satisfaction of hurting.

You must figure the street full of running figures, of doors slamming
and fights for hiding-places. You must figure the tumult suddenly
striking on the unstable equilibrium of old Fletcher’s planks and two
chairs—with cataclysmic results. You must figure an appalled couple
caught dismally in a swing. And then the whole tumultuous rush has
passed and the Iping street with its gauds and flags is deserted save
for the still raging unseen, and littered with cocoanuts, overthrown
canvas screens, and the scattered stock in trade of a sweetstuff stall.
Everywhere there is a sound of closing shutters and shoving bolts, and
the only visible humanity is an occasional flitting eye under a raised
eyebrow in the corner of a window pane.

The Invisible Man amused himself for a little while by breaking all the
windows in the “Coach and Horses,” and then he thrust a street lamp
through the parlour window of Mrs. Gribble. He it must have been who
cut the telegraph wire to Adderdean just beyond Higgins’ cottage on the
Adderdean road. And after that, as his peculiar qualities allowed, he
passed out of human perceptions altogether, and he was neither heard,
seen, nor felt in Iping any more. He vanished absolutely.

But it was the best part of two hours before any human being ventured
out again into the desolation of Iping street.




CHAPTER XIII.
MR. MARVEL DISCUSSES HIS RESIGNATION


When the dusk was gathering and Iping was just beginning to peep
timorously forth again upon the shattered wreckage of its Bank Holiday,
a short, thick-set man in a shabby silk hat was marching painfully
through the twilight behind the beechwoods on the road to Bramblehurst.
He carried three books bound together by some sort of ornamental
elastic ligature, and a bundle wrapped in a blue table-cloth. His
rubicund face expressed consternation and fatigue; he appeared to be in
a spasmodic sort of hurry. He was accompanied by a voice other than his
own, and ever and again he winced under the touch of unseen hands.

“If you give me the slip again,” said the Voice, “if you attempt to
give me the slip again—”

“Lord!” said Mr. Marvel. “That shoulder’s a mass of bruises as it is.”

“On my honour,” said the Voice, “I will kill you.”

“I didn’t try to give you the slip,” said Marvel, in a voice that was
not far remote from tears. “I swear I didn’t. I didn’t know the blessed
turning, that was all! How the devil was I to know the blessed turning?
As it is, I’ve been knocked about—”

“You’ll get knocked about a great deal more if you don’t mind,” said
the Voice, and Mr. Marvel abruptly became silent. He blew out his
cheeks, and his eyes were eloquent of despair.

“It’s bad enough to let these floundering yokels explode my little
secret, without _your_ cutting off with my books. It’s lucky for some
of them they cut and ran when they did! Here am I ... No one knew I was
invisible! And now what am I to do?”

“What am _I_ to do?” asked Marvel, _sotto voce_.

“It’s all about. It will be in the papers! Everybody will be looking
for me; everyone on their guard—” The Voice broke off into vivid curses
and ceased.

The despair of Mr. Marvel’s face deepened, and his pace slackened.

“Go on!” said the Voice.

Mr. Marvel’s face assumed a greyish tint between the ruddier patches.

“Don’t drop those books, stupid,” said the Voice, sharply—overtaking
him.

“The fact is,” said the Voice, “I shall have to make use of you....
You’re a poor tool, but I must.”

“I’m a _miserable_ tool,” said Marvel.

“You are,” said the Voice.

“I’m the worst possible tool you could have,” said Marvel.

“I’m not strong,” he said after a discouraging silence.

“I’m not over strong,” he repeated.

“No?”

“And my heart’s weak. That little business—I pulled it through, of
course—but bless you! I could have dropped.”

“Well?”

“I haven’t the nerve and strength for the sort of thing you want.”

“_I’ll_ stimulate you.”

“I wish you wouldn’t. I wouldn’t like to mess up your plans, you know.
But I might—out of sheer funk and misery.”

“You’d better not,” said the Voice, with quiet emphasis.

“I wish I was dead,” said Marvel.

“It ain’t justice,” he said; “you must admit.... It seems to me I’ve a
perfect right—”

“_Get_ on!” said the Voice.

Mr. Marvel mended his pace, and for a time they went in silence again.

“It’s devilish hard,” said Mr. Marvel.

This was quite ineffectual. He tried another tack.

“What do I make by it?” he began again in a tone of unendurable wrong.

“Oh! _shut up_!” said the Voice, with sudden amazing vigour. “I’ll see
to you all right. You do what you’re told. You’ll do it all right.
You’re a fool and all that, but you’ll do—”

“I tell you, sir, I’m not the man for it. Respectfully—but it _is_ so—”

“If you don’t shut up I shall twist your wrist again,” said the
Invisible Man. “I want to think.”

Presently two oblongs of yellow light appeared through the trees, and
the square tower of a church loomed through the gloaming. “I shall keep
my hand on your shoulder,” said the Voice, “all through the village. Go
straight through and try no foolery. It will be the worse for you if
you do.”

“I know that,” sighed Mr. Marvel, “I know all that.”

The unhappy-looking figure in the obsolete silk hat passed up the
street of the little village with his burdens, and vanished into the
gathering darkness beyond the lights of the windows.




CHAPTER XIV.
AT PORT STOWE


Ten o’clock the next morning found Mr. Marvel, unshaven, dirty, and
travel-stained, sitting with the books beside him and his hands deep in
his pockets, looking very weary, nervous, and uncomfortable, and
inflating his cheeks at infrequent intervals, on the bench outside a
little inn on the outskirts of Port Stowe. Beside him were the books,
but now they were tied with string. The bundle had been abandoned in
the pine-woods beyond Bramblehurst, in accordance with a change in the
plans of the Invisible Man. Mr. Marvel sat on the bench, and although
no one took the slightest notice of him, his agitation remained at
fever heat. His hands would go ever and again to his various pockets
with a curious nervous fumbling.

When he had been sitting for the best part of an hour, however, an
elderly mariner, carrying a newspaper, came out of the inn and sat down
beside him. “Pleasant day,” said the mariner.

Mr. Marvel glanced about him with something very like terror. “Very,”
he said.

“Just seasonable weather for the time of year,” said the mariner,
taking no denial.

“Quite,” said Mr. Marvel.

The mariner produced a toothpick, and (saving his regard) was engrossed
thereby for some minutes. His eyes meanwhile were at liberty to examine
Mr. Marvel’s dusty figure, and the books beside him. As he had
approached Mr. Marvel he had heard a sound like the dropping of coins
into a pocket. He was struck by the contrast of Mr. Marvel’s appearance
with this suggestion of opulence. Thence his mind wandered back again
to a topic that had taken a curiously firm hold of his imagination.

“Books?” he said suddenly, noisily finishing with the toothpick.

Mr. Marvel started and looked at them. “Oh, yes,” he said. “Yes,
they’re books.”

“There’s some extra-ordinary things in books,” said the mariner.

“I believe you,” said Mr. Marvel.

“And some extra-ordinary things out of ’em,” said the mariner.

“True likewise,” said Mr. Marvel. He eyed his interlocutor, and then
glanced about him.

“There’s some extra-ordinary things in newspapers, for example,” said
the mariner.

“There are.”

“In _this_ newspaper,” said the mariner.

“Ah!” said Mr. Marvel.

“There’s a story,” said the mariner, fixing Mr. Marvel with an eye that
was firm and deliberate; “there’s a story about an Invisible Man, for
instance.”

Mr. Marvel pulled his mouth askew and scratched his cheek and felt his
ears glowing. “What will they be writing next?” he asked faintly.
“Ostria, or America?”

“Neither,” said the mariner. “_Here_.”

“Lord!” said Mr. Marvel, starting.

“When I say _here_,” said the mariner, to Mr. Marvel’s intense relief,
“I don’t of course mean here in this place, I mean hereabouts.”

“An Invisible Man!” said Mr. Marvel. “And what’s _he_ been up to?”

“Everything,” said the mariner, controlling Marvel with his eye, and
then amplifying, “every—blessed—thing.”

“I ain’t seen a paper these four days,” said Marvel.

“Iping’s the place he started at,” said the mariner.

“In-_deed_!” said Mr. Marvel.

“He started there. And where he came from, nobody don’t seem to know.
Here it is: ‘Pe-culiar Story from Iping.’ And it says in this paper
that the evidence is extra-ordinary strong—extra-ordinary.”

“Lord!” said Mr. Marvel.

“But then, it’s an extra-ordinary story. There is a clergyman and a
medical gent witnesses—saw ’im all right and proper—or leastways didn’t
see ’im. He was staying, it says, at the ‘Coach an’ Horses,’ and no one
don’t seem to have been aware of his misfortune, it says, aware of his
misfortune, until in an Altercation in the inn, it says, his bandages
on his head was torn off. It was then ob-served that his head was
invisible. Attempts were At Once made to secure him, but casting off
his garments, it says, he succeeded in escaping, but not until after a
desperate struggle, in which he had inflicted serious injuries, it
says, on our worthy and able constable, Mr. J. A. Jaffers. Pretty
straight story, eh? Names and everything.”

“Lord!” said Mr. Marvel, looking nervously about him, trying to count
the money in his pockets by his unaided sense of touch, and full of a
strange and novel idea. “It sounds most astonishing.”

“Don’t it? Extra-ordinary, _I_ call it. Never heard tell of Invisible
Men before, I haven’t, but nowadays one hears such a lot of
extra-ordinary things—that—”

“That all he did?” asked Marvel, trying to seem at his ease.

“It’s enough, ain’t it?” said the mariner.

“Didn’t go Back by any chance?” asked Marvel. “Just escaped and that’s
all, eh?”

“All!” said the mariner. “Why!—ain’t it enough?”

“Quite enough,” said Marvel.

“I should think it was enough,” said the mariner. “I should think it
was enough.”

“He didn’t have any pals—it don’t say he had any pals, does it?” asked
Mr. Marvel, anxious.

“Ain’t one of a sort enough for you?” asked the mariner. “No, thank
Heaven, as one might say, he didn’t.”

He nodded his head slowly. “It makes me regular uncomfortable, the bare
thought of that chap running about the country! He is at present At
Large, and from certain evidence it is supposed that he
has—taken—_took_, I suppose they mean—the road to Port Stowe. You see
we’re right _in_ it! None of your American wonders, this time. And just
think of the things he might do! Where’d you be, if he took a drop over
and above, and had a fancy to go for you? Suppose he wants to rob—who
can prevent him? He can trespass, he can burgle, he could walk through
a cordon of policemen as easy as me or you could give the slip to a
blind man! Easier! For these here blind chaps hear uncommon sharp, I’m
told. And wherever there was liquor he fancied—”

“He’s got a tremenjous advantage, certainly,” said Mr. Marvel.
“And—well...”

“You’re right,” said the mariner. “He _has_.”

All this time Mr. Marvel had been glancing about him intently,
listening for faint footfalls, trying to detect imperceptible
movements. He seemed on the point of some great resolution. He coughed
behind his hand.

He looked about him again, listened, bent towards the mariner, and
lowered his voice: “The fact of it is—I happen—to know just a thing or
two about this Invisible Man. From private sources.”

“Oh!” said the mariner, interested. “_You_?”

“Yes,” said Mr. Marvel. “Me.”

“Indeed!” said the mariner. “And may I ask—”

“You’ll be astonished,” said Mr. Marvel behind his hand. “It’s
tremenjous.”

“Indeed!” said the mariner.

“The fact is,” began Mr. Marvel eagerly in a confidential undertone.
Suddenly his expression changed marvellously. “Ow!” he said. He rose
stiffly in his seat. His face was eloquent of physical suffering.
“Wow!” he said.

“What’s up?” said the mariner, concerned.

“Toothache,” said Mr. Marvel, and put his hand to his ear. He caught
hold of his books. “I must be getting on, I think,” he said. He edged
in a curious way along the seat away from his interlocutor. “But you
was just a-going to tell me about this here Invisible Man!” protested
the mariner. Mr. Marvel seemed to consult with himself. “Hoax,” said a
Voice. “It’s a hoax,” said Mr. Marvel.

“But it’s in the paper,” said the mariner.

“Hoax all the same,” said Marvel. “I know the chap that started the
lie. There ain’t no Invisible Man whatsoever—Blimey.”

“But how ’bout this paper? D’you mean to say—?”

“Not a word of it,” said Marvel, stoutly.

The mariner stared, paper in hand. Mr. Marvel jerkily faced about.
“Wait a bit,” said the mariner, rising and speaking slowly, “D’you mean
to say—?”

“I do,” said Mr. Marvel.

“Then why did you let me go on and tell you all this blarsted stuff,
then? What d’yer mean by letting a man make a fool of himself like that
for? Eh?”

Mr. Marvel blew out his cheeks. The mariner was suddenly very red
indeed; he clenched his hands. “I been talking here this ten minutes,”
he said; “and you, you little pot-bellied, leathery-faced son of an old
boot, couldn’t have the elementary manners—”

“Don’t you come bandying words with _me_,” said Mr. Marvel.

“Bandying words! I’m a jolly good mind—”

“Come up,” said a Voice, and Mr. Marvel was suddenly whirled about and
started marching off in a curious spasmodic manner. “You’d better move
on,” said the mariner. “Who’s moving on?” said Mr. Marvel. He was
receding obliquely with a curious hurrying gait, with occasional
violent jerks forward. Some way along the road he began a muttered
monologue, protests and recriminations.

“Silly devil!” said the mariner, legs wide apart, elbows akimbo,
watching the receding figure. “I’ll show you, you silly ass—hoaxing
_me_! It’s here—on the paper!”

Mr. Marvel retorted incoherently and, receding, was hidden by a bend in
the road, but the mariner still stood magnificent in the midst of the
way, until the approach of a butcher’s cart dislodged him. Then he
turned himself towards Port Stowe. “Full of extra-ordinary asses,” he
said softly to himself. “Just to take me down a bit—that was his silly
game—It’s on the paper!”

And there was another extraordinary thing he was presently to hear,
that had happened quite close to him. And that was a vision of a “fist
full of money” (no less) travelling without visible agency, along by
the wall at the corner of St. Michael’s Lane. A brother mariner had
seen this wonderful sight that very morning. He had snatched at the
money forthwith and had been knocked headlong, and when he had got to
his feet the butterfly money had vanished. Our mariner was in the mood
to believe anything, he declared, but that was a bit _too_ stiff.
Afterwards, however, he began to think things over.

The story of the flying money was true. And all about that
neighbourhood, even from the august London and Country Banking Company,
from the tills of shops and inns—doors standing that sunny weather
entirely open—money had been quietly and dexterously making off that
day in handfuls and rouleaux, floating quietly along by walls and shady
places, dodging quickly from the approaching eyes of men. And it had,
though no man had traced it, invariably ended its mysterious flight in
the pocket of that agitated gentleman in the obsolete silk hat, sitting
outside the little inn on the outskirts of Port Stowe.

It was ten days after—and indeed only when the Burdock story was
already old—that the mariner collated these facts and began to
understand how near he had been to the wonderful Invisible Man.




CHAPTER XV.
THE MAN WHO WAS RUNNING


In the early evening time Dr. Kemp was sitting in his study in the
belvedere on the hill overlooking Burdock. It was a pleasant little
room, with three windows—north, west, and south—and bookshelves covered
with books and scientific publications, and a broad writing-table, and,
under the north window, a microscope, glass slips, minute instruments,
some cultures, and scattered bottles of reagents. Dr. Kemp’s solar lamp
was lit, albeit the sky was still bright with the sunset light, and his
blinds were up because there was no offence of peering outsiders to
require them pulled down. Dr. Kemp was a tall and slender young man,
with flaxen hair and a moustache almost white, and the work he was upon
would earn him, he hoped, the fellowship of the Royal Society, so
highly did he think of it.

And his eye, presently wandering from his work, caught the sunset
blazing at the back of the hill that is over against his own. For a
minute perhaps he sat, pen in mouth, admiring the rich golden colour
above the crest, and then his attention was attracted by the little
figure of a man, inky black, running over the hill-brow towards him. He
was a shortish little man, and he wore a high hat, and he was running
so fast that his legs verily twinkled.

“Another of those fools,” said Dr. Kemp. “Like that ass who ran into me
this morning round a corner, with the ‘’Visible Man a-coming, sir!’ I
can’t imagine what possesses people. One might think we were in the
thirteenth century.”

He got up, went to the window, and stared at the dusky hillside, and
the dark little figure tearing down it. “He seems in a confounded
hurry,” said Dr. Kemp, “but he doesn’t seem to be getting on. If his
pockets were full of lead, he couldn’t run heavier.”

“Spurted, sir,” said Dr. Kemp.

In another moment the higher of the villas that had clambered up the
hill from Burdock had occulted the running figure. He was visible again
for a moment, and again, and then again, three times between the three
detached houses that came next, and then the terrace hid him.

“Asses!” said Dr. Kemp, swinging round on his heel and walking back to
his writing-table.

But those who saw the fugitive nearer, and perceived the abject terror
on his perspiring face, being themselves in the open roadway, did not
share in the doctor’s contempt. By the man pounded, and as he ran he
chinked like a well-filled purse that is tossed to and fro. He looked
neither to the right nor the left, but his dilated eyes stared straight
downhill to where the lamps were being lit, and the people were crowded
in the street. And his ill-shaped mouth fell apart, and a glairy foam
lay on his lips, and his breath came hoarse and noisy. All he passed
stopped and began staring up the road and down, and interrogating one
another with an inkling of discomfort for the reason of his haste.

And then presently, far up the hill, a dog playing in the road yelped
and ran under a gate, and as they still wondered something—a wind—a
pad, pad, pad,—a sound like a panting breathing, rushed by.

People screamed. People sprang off the pavement: It passed in shouts,
it passed by instinct down the hill. They were shouting in the street
before Marvel was halfway there. They were bolting into houses and
slamming the doors behind them, with the news. He heard it and made one
last desperate spurt. Fear came striding by, rushed ahead of him, and
in a moment had seized the town.

“The Invisible Man is coming! The Invisible Man!”




CHAPTER XVI.
IN THE “JOLLY CRICKETERS”


The “Jolly Cricketers” is just at the bottom of the hill, where the
tram-lines begin. The barman leant his fat red arms on the counter and
talked of horses with an anaemic cabman, while a black-bearded man in
grey snapped up biscuit and cheese, drank Burton, and conversed in
American with a policeman off duty.

“What’s the shouting about!” said the anaemic cabman, going off at a
tangent, trying to see up the hill over the dirty yellow blind in the
low window of the inn. Somebody ran by outside. “Fire, perhaps,” said
the barman.

Footsteps approached, running heavily, the door was pushed open
violently, and Marvel, weeping and dishevelled, his hat gone, the neck
of his coat torn open, rushed in, made a convulsive turn, and attempted
to shut the door. It was held half open by a strap.

“Coming!” he bawled, his voice shrieking with terror. “He’s coming. The
’Visible Man! After me! For Gawd’s sake! ’Elp! ’Elp! ’Elp!”

“Shut the doors,” said the policeman. “Who’s coming? What’s the row?”
He went to the door, released the strap, and it slammed. The American
closed the other door.

“Lemme go inside,” said Marvel, staggering and weeping, but still
clutching the books. “Lemme go inside. Lock me in—somewhere. I tell you
he’s after me. I give him the slip. He said he’d kill me and he will.”

“_You’re_ safe,” said the man with the black beard. “The door’s shut.
What’s it all about?”

“Lemme go inside,” said Marvel, and shrieked aloud as a blow suddenly
made the fastened door shiver and was followed by a hurried rapping and
a shouting outside. “Hullo,” cried the policeman, “who’s there?” Mr.
Marvel began to make frantic dives at panels that looked like doors.
“He’ll kill me—he’s got a knife or something. For Gawd’s sake—!”

“Here you are,” said the barman. “Come in here.” And he held up the
flap of the bar.

Mr. Marvel rushed behind the bar as the summons outside was repeated.
“Don’t open the door,” he screamed. “_Please_ don’t open the door.
_Where_ shall I hide?”

“This, this Invisible Man, then?” asked the man with the black beard,
with one hand behind him. “I guess it’s about time we saw him.”

The window of the inn was suddenly smashed in, and there was a
screaming and running to and fro in the street. The policeman had been
standing on the settee staring out, craning to see who was at the door.
He got down with raised eyebrows. “It’s that,” he said. The barman
stood in front of the bar-parlour door which was now locked on Mr.
Marvel, stared at the smashed window, and came round to the two other
men.

Everything was suddenly quiet. “I wish I had my truncheon,” said the
policeman, going irresolutely to the door. “Once we open, in he comes.
There’s no stopping him.”

“Don’t you be in too much hurry about that door,” said the anaemic
cabman, anxiously.

“Draw the bolts,” said the man with the black beard, “and if he comes—”
He showed a revolver in his hand.

“That won’t do,” said the policeman; “that’s murder.”

“I know what country I’m in,” said the man with the beard. “I’m going
to let off at his legs. Draw the bolts.”

“Not with that blinking thing going off behind me,” said the barman,
craning over the blind.

“Very well,” said the man with the black beard, and stooping down,
revolver ready, drew them himself. Barman, cabman, and policeman faced
about.

“Come in,” said the bearded man in an undertone, standing back and
facing the unbolted doors with his pistol behind him. No one came in,
the door remained closed. Five minutes afterwards when a second cabman
pushed his head in cautiously, they were still waiting, and an anxious
face peered out of the bar-parlour and supplied information. “Are all
the doors of the house shut?” asked Marvel. “He’s going round—prowling
round. He’s as artful as the devil.”

“Good Lord!” said the burly barman. “There’s the back! Just watch them
doors! I say—!” He looked about him helplessly. The bar-parlour door
slammed and they heard the key turn. “There’s the yard door and the
private door. The yard door—”

He rushed out of the bar.

In a minute he reappeared with a carving-knife in his hand. “The yard
door was open!” he said, and his fat underlip dropped. “He may be in
the house now!” said the first cabman.

“He’s not in the kitchen,” said the barman. “There’s two women there,
and I’ve stabbed every inch of it with this little beef slicer. And
they don’t think he’s come in. They haven’t noticed—”

“Have you fastened it?” asked the first cabman.

“I’m out of frocks,” said the barman.

The man with the beard replaced his revolver. And even as he did so the
flap of the bar was shut down and the bolt clicked, and then with a
tremendous thud the catch of the door snapped and the bar-parlour door
burst open. They heard Marvel squeal like a caught leveret, and
forthwith they were clambering over the bar to his rescue. The bearded
man’s revolver cracked and the looking-glass at the back of the parlour
starred and came smashing and tinkling down.

As the barman entered the room he saw Marvel, curiously crumpled up and
struggling against the door that led to the yard and kitchen. The door
flew open while the barman hesitated, and Marvel was dragged into the
kitchen. There was a scream and a clatter of pans. Marvel, head down,
and lugging back obstinately, was forced to the kitchen door, and the
bolts were drawn.

Then the policeman, who had been trying to pass the barman, rushed in,
followed by one of the cabmen, gripped the wrist of the invisible hand
that collared Marvel, was hit in the face and went reeling back. The
door opened, and Marvel made a frantic effort to obtain a lodgment
behind it. Then the cabman collared something. “I got him,” said the
cabman. The barman’s red hands came clawing at the unseen. “Here he
is!” said the barman.

Mr. Marvel, released, suddenly dropped to the ground and made an
attempt to crawl behind the legs of the fighting men. The struggle
blundered round the edge of the door. The voice of the Invisible Man
was heard for the first time, yelling out sharply, as the policeman
trod on his foot. Then he cried out passionately and his fists flew
round like flails. The cabman suddenly whooped and doubled up, kicked
under the diaphragm. The door into the bar-parlour from the kitchen
slammed and covered Mr. Marvel’s retreat. The men in the kitchen found
themselves clutching at and struggling with empty air.

“Where’s he gone?” cried the man with the beard. “Out?”

“This way,” said the policeman, stepping into the yard and stopping.

A piece of tile whizzed by his head and smashed among the crockery on
the kitchen table.

“I’ll show him,” shouted the man with the black beard, and suddenly a
steel barrel shone over the policeman’s shoulder, and five bullets had
followed one another into the twilight whence the missile had come. As
he fired, the man with the beard moved his hand in a horizontal curve,
so that his shots radiated out into the narrow yard like spokes from a
wheel.

A silence followed. “Five cartridges,” said the man with the black
beard. “That’s the best of all. Four aces and a joker. Get a lantern,
someone, and come and feel about for his body.”




CHAPTER XVII.
DR. KEMP’S VISITOR


Dr. Kemp had continued writing in his study until the shots aroused
him. Crack, crack, crack, they came one after the other.

“Hullo!” said Dr. Kemp, putting his pen into his mouth again and
listening. “Who’s letting off revolvers in Burdock? What are the asses
at now?”

He went to the south window, threw it up, and leaning out stared down
on the network of windows, beaded gas-lamps and shops, with its black
interstices of roof and yard that made up the town at night. “Looks
like a crowd down the hill,” he said, “by ‘The Cricketers,’” and
remained watching. Thence his eyes wandered over the town to far away
where the ships’ lights shone, and the pier glowed—a little
illuminated, facetted pavilion like a gem of yellow light. The moon in
its first quarter hung over the westward hill, and the stars were clear
and almost tropically bright.

After five minutes, during which his mind had travelled into a remote
speculation of social conditions of the future, and lost itself at last
over the time dimension, Dr. Kemp roused himself with a sigh, pulled
down the window again, and returned to his writing desk.

It must have been about an hour after this that the front-door bell
rang. He had been writing slackly, and with intervals of abstraction,
since the shots. He sat listening. He heard the servant answer the
door, and waited for her feet on the staircase, but she did not come.
“Wonder what that was,” said Dr. Kemp.

He tried to resume his work, failed, got up, went downstairs from his
study to the landing, rang, and called over the balustrade to the
housemaid as she appeared in the hall below. “Was that a letter?” he
asked.

“Only a runaway ring, sir,” she answered.

“I’m restless to-night,” he said to himself. He went back to his study,
and this time attacked his work resolutely. In a little while he was
hard at work again, and the only sounds in the room were the ticking of
the clock and the subdued shrillness of his quill, hurrying in the very
centre of the circle of light his lampshade threw on his table.

It was two o’clock before Dr. Kemp had finished his work for the night.
He rose, yawned, and went downstairs to bed. He had already removed his
coat and vest, when he noticed that he was thirsty. He took a candle
and went down to the dining-room in search of a syphon and whiskey.

Dr. Kemp’s scientific pursuits have made him a very observant man, and
as he recrossed the hall, he noticed a dark spot on the linoleum near
the mat at the foot of the stairs. He went on upstairs, and then it
suddenly occurred to him to ask himself what the spot on the linoleum
might be. Apparently some subconscious element was at work. At any
rate, he turned with his burden, went back to the hall, put down the
syphon and whiskey, and bending down, touched the spot. Without any
great surprise he found it had the stickiness and colour of drying
blood.

He took up his burden again, and returned upstairs, looking about him
and trying to account for the blood-spot. On the landing he saw
something and stopped astonished. The door-handle of his own room was
blood-stained.

He looked at his own hand. It was quite clean, and then he remembered
that the door of his room had been open when he came down from his
study, and that consequently he had not touched the handle at all. He
went straight into his room, his face quite calm—perhaps a trifle more
resolute than usual. His glance, wandering inquisitively, fell on the
bed. On the counterpane was a mess of blood, and the sheet had been
torn. He had not noticed this before because he had walked straight to
the dressing-table. On the further side the bedclothes were depressed
as if someone had been recently sitting there.

Then he had an odd impression that he had heard a low voice say, “Good
Heavens!—Kemp!” But Dr. Kemp was no believer in voices.

He stood staring at the tumbled sheets. Was that really a voice? He
looked about again, but noticed nothing further than the disordered and
blood-stained bed. Then he distinctly heard a movement across the room,
near the wash-hand stand. All men, however highly educated, retain some
superstitious inklings. The feeling that is called “eerie” came upon
him. He closed the door of the room, came forward to the
dressing-table, and put down his burdens. Suddenly, with a start, he
perceived a coiled and blood-stained bandage of linen rag hanging in
mid-air, between him and the wash-hand stand.

He stared at this in amazement. It was an empty bandage, a bandage
properly tied but quite empty. He would have advanced to grasp it, but
a touch arrested him, and a voice speaking quite close to him.

“Kemp!” said the Voice.

“Eh?” said Kemp, with his mouth open.

“Keep your nerve,” said the Voice. “I’m an Invisible Man.”

Kemp made no answer for a space, simply stared at the bandage.
“Invisible Man,” he said.

“I am an Invisible Man,” repeated the Voice.

The story he had been active to ridicule only that morning rushed
through Kemp’s brain. He does not appear to have been either very much
frightened or very greatly surprised at the moment. Realisation came
later.

“I thought it was all a lie,” he said. The thought uppermost in his
mind was the reiterated arguments of the morning. “Have you a bandage
on?” he asked.

“Yes,” said the Invisible Man.

“Oh!” said Kemp, and then roused himself. “I say!” he said. “But this
is nonsense. It’s some trick.” He stepped forward suddenly, and his
hand, extended towards the bandage, met invisible fingers.

He recoiled at the touch and his colour changed.

“Keep steady, Kemp, for God’s sake! I want help badly. Stop!”

The hand gripped his arm. He struck at it.

“Kemp!” cried the Voice. “Kemp! Keep steady!” and the grip tightened.

A frantic desire to free himself took possession of Kemp. The hand of
the bandaged arm gripped his shoulder, and he was suddenly tripped and
flung backwards upon the bed. He opened his mouth to shout, and the
corner of the sheet was thrust between his teeth. The Invisible Man had
him down grimly, but his arms were free and he struck and tried to kick
savagely.

“Listen to reason, will you?” said the Invisible Man, sticking to him
in spite of a pounding in the ribs. “By Heaven! you’ll madden me in a
minute!

“Lie still, you fool!” bawled the Invisible Man in Kemp’s ear.

Kemp struggled for another moment and then lay still.

“If you shout, I’ll smash your face,” said the Invisible Man, relieving
his mouth.

“I’m an Invisible Man. It’s no foolishness, and no magic. I really am
an Invisible Man. And I want your help. I don’t want to hurt you, but
if you behave like a frantic rustic, I must. Don’t you remember me,
Kemp? Griffin, of University College?”

“Let me get up,” said Kemp. “I’ll stop where I am. And let me sit quiet
for a minute.”

He sat up and felt his neck.

“I am Griffin, of University College, and I have made myself invisible.
I am just an ordinary man—a man you have known—made invisible.”

“Griffin?” said Kemp.

“Griffin,” answered the Voice. A younger student than you were, almost
an albino, six feet high, and broad, with a pink and white face and red
eyes, who won the medal for chemistry.”

“I am confused,” said Kemp. “My brain is rioting. What has this to do
with Griffin?”

“I _am_ Griffin.”

Kemp thought. “It’s horrible,” he said. “But what devilry must happen
to make a man invisible?”

“It’s no devilry. It’s a process, sane and intelligible enough—”

“It’s horrible!” said Kemp. “How on earth—?”

“It’s horrible enough. But I’m wounded and in pain, and tired ... Great
God! Kemp, you are a man. Take it steady. Give me some food and drink,
and let me sit down here.”

Kemp stared at the bandage as it moved across the room, then saw a
basket chair dragged across the floor and come to rest near the bed. It
creaked, and the seat was depressed the quarter of an inch or so. He
rubbed his eyes and felt his neck again. “This beats ghosts,” he said,
and laughed stupidly.

“That’s better. Thank Heaven, you’re getting sensible!”

“Or silly,” said Kemp, and knuckled his eyes.

“Give me some whiskey. I’m near dead.”

“It didn’t feel so. Where are you? If I get up shall I run into you?
_There_! all right. Whiskey? Here. Where shall I give it to you?”

The chair creaked and Kemp felt the glass drawn away from him. He let
go by an effort; his instinct was all against it. It came to rest
poised twenty inches above the front edge of the seat of the chair. He
stared at it in infinite perplexity. “This is—this must be—hypnotism.
You have suggested you are invisible.”

“Nonsense,” said the Voice.

“It’s frantic.”

“Listen to me.”

“I demonstrated conclusively this morning,” began Kemp, “that
invisibility—”

“Never mind what you’ve demonstrated!—I’m starving,” said the Voice,
“and the night is chilly to a man without clothes.”

“Food?” said Kemp.

The tumbler of whiskey tilted itself. “Yes,” said the Invisible Man
rapping it down. “Have you a dressing-gown?”

Kemp made some exclamation in an undertone. He walked to a wardrobe and
produced a robe of dingy scarlet. “This do?” he asked. It was taken
from him. It hung limp for a moment in mid-air, fluttered weirdly,
stood full and decorous buttoning itself, and sat down in his chair.
“Drawers, socks, slippers would be a comfort,” said the Unseen, curtly.
“And food.”

“Anything. But this is the insanest thing I ever was in, in my life!”

He turned out his drawers for the articles, and then went downstairs to
ransack his larder. He came back with some cold cutlets and bread,
pulled up a light table, and placed them before his guest. “Never mind
knives,” said his visitor, and a cutlet hung in mid-air, with a sound
of gnawing.

“Invisible!” said Kemp, and sat down on a bedroom chair.

“I always like to get something about me before I eat,” said the
Invisible Man, with a full mouth, eating greedily. “Queer fancy!”

“I suppose that wrist is all right,” said Kemp.

“Trust me,” said the Invisible Man.

“Of all the strange and wonderful—”

“Exactly. But it’s odd I should blunder into _your_ house to get my
bandaging. My first stroke of luck! Anyhow I meant to sleep in this
house to-night. You must stand that! It’s a filthy nuisance, my blood
showing, isn’t it? Quite a clot over there. Gets visible as it
coagulates, I see. It’s only the living tissue I’ve changed, and only
for as long as I’m alive.... I’ve been in the house three hours.”

“But how’s it done?” began Kemp, in a tone of exasperation. “Confound
it! The whole business—it’s unreasonable from beginning to end.”

“Quite reasonable,” said the Invisible Man. “Perfectly reasonable.”

He reached over and secured the whiskey bottle. Kemp stared at the
devouring dressing gown. A ray of candle-light penetrating a torn patch
in the right shoulder, made a triangle of light under the left ribs.
“What were the shots?” he asked. “How did the shooting begin?”

“There was a real fool of a man—a sort of confederate of mine—curse
him!—who tried to steal my money. _Has_ done so.”

“Is _he_ invisible too?”

“No.”

“Well?”

“Can’t I have some more to eat before I tell you all that? I’m
hungry—in pain. And you want me to tell stories!”

Kemp got up. “_You_ didn’t do any shooting?” he asked.

“Not me,” said his visitor. “Some fool I’d never seen fired at random.
A lot of them got scared. They all got scared at me. Curse them!—I
say—I want more to eat than this, Kemp.”

“I’ll see what there is to eat downstairs,” said Kemp. “Not much, I’m
afraid.”

After he had done eating, and he made a heavy meal, the Invisible Man
demanded a cigar. He bit the end savagely before Kemp could find a
knife, and cursed when the outer leaf loosened. It was strange to see
him smoking; his mouth, and throat, pharynx and nares, became visible
as a sort of whirling smoke cast.

“This blessed gift of smoking!” he said, and puffed vigorously. “I’m
lucky to have fallen upon you, Kemp. You must help me. Fancy tumbling
on you just now! I’m in a devilish scrape—I’ve been mad, I think. The
things I have been through! But we will do things yet. Let me tell
you—”

He helped himself to more whiskey and soda. Kemp got up, looked about
him, and fetched a glass from his spare room. “It’s wild—but I suppose
I may drink.”

“You haven’t changed much, Kemp, these dozen years. You fair men don’t.
Cool and methodical—after the first collapse. I must tell you. We will
work together!”

“But how was it all done?” said Kemp, “and how did you get like this?”

“For God’s sake, let me smoke in peace for a little while! And then I
will begin to tell you.”

But the story was not told that night. The Invisible Man’s wrist was
growing painful; he was feverish, exhausted, and his mind came round to
brood upon his chase down the hill and the struggle about the inn. He
spoke in fragments of Marvel, he smoked faster, his voice grew angry.
Kemp tried to gather what he could.

“He was afraid of me, I could see that he was afraid of me,” said the
Invisible Man many times over. “He meant to give me the slip—he was
always casting about! What a fool I was!

“The cur!

“I should have killed him!”

“Where did you get the money?” asked Kemp, abruptly.

The Invisible Man was silent for a space. “I can’t tell you to-night,”
he said.

He groaned suddenly and leant forward, supporting his invisible head on
invisible hands. “Kemp,” he said, “I’ve had no sleep for near three
days, except a couple of dozes of an hour or so. I must sleep soon.”

“Well, have my room—have this room.”

“But how can I sleep? If I sleep—he will get away. Ugh! What does it
matter?”

“What’s the shot wound?” asked Kemp, abruptly.

“Nothing—scratch and blood. Oh, God! How I want sleep!”

“Why not?”

The Invisible Man appeared to be regarding Kemp. “Because I’ve a
particular objection to being caught by my fellow-men,” he said slowly.

Kemp started.

“Fool that I am!” said the Invisible Man, striking the table smartly.
“I’ve put the idea into your head.”




CHAPTER XVIII.
THE INVISIBLE MAN SLEEPS


Exhausted and wounded as the Invisible Man was, he refused to accept
Kemp’s word that his freedom should be respected. He examined the two
windows of the bedroom, drew up the blinds and opened the sashes, to
confirm Kemp’s statement that a retreat by them would be possible.
Outside the night was very quiet and still, and the new moon was
setting over the down. Then he examined the keys of the bedroom and the
two dressing-room doors, to satisfy himself that these also could be
made an assurance of freedom. Finally he expressed himself satisfied.
He stood on the hearth rug and Kemp heard the sound of a yawn.

“I’m sorry,” said the Invisible Man, “if I cannot tell you all that I
have done to-night. But I am worn out. It’s grotesque, no doubt. It’s
horrible! But believe me, Kemp, in spite of your arguments of this
morning, it is quite a possible thing. I have made a discovery. I meant
to keep it to myself. I can’t. I must have a partner. And you.... We
can do such things ... But to-morrow. Now, Kemp, I feel as though I
must sleep or perish.”

Kemp stood in the middle of the room staring at the headless garment.
“I suppose I must leave you,” he said. “It’s—incredible. Three things
happening like this, overturning all my preconceptions—would make me
insane. But it’s real! Is there anything more that I can get you?”

“Only bid me good-night,” said Griffin.

“Good-night,” said Kemp, and shook an invisible hand. He walked
sideways to the door. Suddenly the dressing-gown walked quickly towards
him. “Understand me!” said the dressing-gown. “No attempts to hamper
me, or capture me! Or—”

Kemp’s face changed a little. “I thought I gave you my word,” he said.

Kemp closed the door softly behind him, and the key was turned upon him
forthwith. Then, as he stood with an expression of passive amazement on
his face, the rapid feet came to the door of the dressing-room and that
too was locked. Kemp slapped his brow with his hand. “Am I dreaming?
Has the world gone mad—or have I?”

He laughed, and put his hand to the locked door. “Barred out of my own
bedroom, by a flagrant absurdity!” he said.

He walked to the head of the staircase, turned, and stared at the
locked doors. “It’s fact,” he said. He put his fingers to his slightly
bruised neck. “Undeniable fact!

“But—”

He shook his head hopelessly, turned, and went downstairs.

He lit the dining-room lamp, got out a cigar, and began pacing the
room, ejaculating. Now and then he would argue with himself.

“Invisible!” he said.

“Is there such a thing as an invisible animal? ... In the sea, yes.
Thousands—millions. All the larvae, all the little nauplii and
tornarias, all the microscopic things, the jelly-fish. In the sea there
are more things invisible than visible! I never thought of that before.
And in the ponds too! All those little pond-life things—specks of
colourless translucent jelly! But in air? No!

“It can’t be.

“But after all—why not?

“If a man was made of glass he would still be visible.”

His meditation became profound. The bulk of three cigars had passed
into the invisible or diffused as a white ash over the carpet before he
spoke again. Then it was merely an exclamation. He turned aside, walked
out of the room, and went into his little consulting-room and lit the
gas there. It was a little room, because Dr. Kemp did not live by
practice, and in it were the day’s newspapers. The morning’s paper lay
carelessly opened and thrown aside. He caught it up, turned it over,
and read the account of a “Strange Story from Iping” that the mariner
at Port Stowe had spelt over so painfully to Mr. Marvel. Kemp read it
swiftly.

“Wrapped up!” said Kemp. “Disguised! Hiding it! ‘No one seems to have
been aware of his misfortune.’ What the devil _is_ his game?”

He dropped the paper, and his eye went seeking. “Ah!” he said, and
caught up the _St. James’ Gazette_, lying folded up as it arrived. “Now
we shall get at the truth,” said Dr. Kemp. He rent the paper open; a
couple of columns confronted him. “An Entire Village in Sussex goes
Mad” was the heading.

“Good Heavens!” said Kemp, reading eagerly an incredulous account of
the events in Iping, of the previous afternoon, that have already been
described. Over the leaf the report in the morning paper had been
reprinted.

He re-read it. “Ran through the streets striking right and left.
Jaffers insensible. Mr. Huxter in great pain—still unable to describe
what he saw. Painful humiliation—vicar. Woman ill with terror! Windows
smashed. This extraordinary story probably a fabrication. Too good not
to print—_cum grano_!”

He dropped the paper and stared blankly in front of him. “Probably a
fabrication!”

He caught up the paper again, and re-read the whole business. “But when
does the Tramp come in? Why the deuce was he chasing a tramp?”

He sat down abruptly on the surgical bench. “He’s not only invisible,”
he said, “but he’s mad! Homicidal!”

When dawn came to mingle its pallor with the lamp-light and cigar smoke
of the dining-room, Kemp was still pacing up and down, trying to grasp
the incredible.

He was altogether too excited to sleep. His servants, descending
sleepily, discovered him, and were inclined to think that over-study
had worked this ill on him. He gave them extraordinary but quite
explicit instructions to lay breakfast for two in the belvedere
study—and then to confine themselves to the basement and ground-floor.
Then he continued to pace the dining-room until the morning’s paper
came. That had much to say and little to tell, beyond the confirmation
of the evening before, and a very badly written account of another
remarkable tale from Port Burdock. This gave Kemp the essence of the
happenings at the “Jolly Cricketers,” and the name of Marvel. “He has
made me keep with him twenty-four hours,” Marvel testified. Certain
minor facts were added to the Iping story, notably the cutting of the
village telegraph-wire. But there was nothing to throw light on the
connexion between the Invisible Man and the Tramp; for Mr. Marvel had
supplied no information about the three books, or the money with which
he was lined. The incredulous tone had vanished and a shoal of
reporters and inquirers were already at work elaborating the matter.

Kemp read every scrap of the report and sent his housemaid out to get
every one of the morning papers she could. These also he devoured.

“He is invisible!” he said. “And it reads like rage growing to mania!
The things he may do! The things he may do! And he’s upstairs free as
the air. What on earth ought I to do?”

“For instance, would it be a breach of faith if—? No.”

He went to a little untidy desk in the corner, and began a note. He
tore this up half written, and wrote another. He read it over and
considered it. Then he took an envelope and addressed it to “Colonel
Adye, Port Burdock.”

The Invisible Man awoke even as Kemp was doing this. He awoke in an
evil temper, and Kemp, alert for every sound, heard his pattering feet
rush suddenly across the bedroom overhead. Then a chair was flung over
and the wash-hand stand tumbler smashed. Kemp hurried upstairs and
rapped eagerly.




CHAPTER XIX.
CERTAIN FIRST PRINCIPLES


“What’s the matter?” asked Kemp, when the Invisible Man admitted him.

“Nothing,” was the answer.

“But, confound it! The smash?”

“Fit of temper,” said the Invisible Man. “Forgot this arm; and it’s
sore.”

“You’re rather liable to that sort of thing.”

“I am.”

Kemp walked across the room and picked up the fragments of broken
glass. “All the facts are out about you,” said Kemp, standing up with
the glass in his hand; “all that happened in Iping, and down the hill.
The world has become aware of its invisible citizen. But no one knows
you are here.”

The Invisible Man swore.

“The secret’s out. I gather it was a secret. I don’t know what your
plans are, but of course I’m anxious to help you.”

The Invisible Man sat down on the bed.

“There’s breakfast upstairs,” said Kemp, speaking as easily as
possible, and he was delighted to find his strange guest rose
willingly. Kemp led the way up the narrow staircase to the belvedere.

“Before we can do anything else,” said Kemp, “I must understand a
little more about this invisibility of yours.” He had sat down, after
one nervous glance out of the window, with the air of a man who has
talking to do. His doubts of the sanity of the entire business flashed
and vanished again as he looked across to where Griffin sat at the
breakfast-table—a headless, handless dressing-gown, wiping unseen lips
on a miraculously held serviette.

“It’s simple enough—and credible enough,” said Griffin, putting the
serviette aside and leaning the invisible head on an invisible hand.

“No doubt, to you, but—” Kemp laughed.

“Well, yes; to me it seemed wonderful at first, no doubt. But now,
great God! ... But we will do great things yet! I came on the stuff
first at Chesilstowe.”

“Chesilstowe?”

“I went there after I left London. You know I dropped medicine and took
up physics? No; well, I did. _Light_ fascinated me.”

“Ah!”

“Optical density! The whole subject is a network of riddles—a network
with solutions glimmering elusively through. And being but
two-and-twenty and full of enthusiasm, I said, ‘I will devote my life
to this. This is worth while.’ You know what fools we are at
two-and-twenty?”

“Fools then or fools now,” said Kemp.

“As though knowing could be any satisfaction to a man!

“But I went to work—like a slave. And I had hardly worked and thought
about the matter six months before light came through one of the meshes
suddenly—blindingly! I found a general principle of pigments and
refraction—a formula, a geometrical expression involving four
dimensions. Fools, common men, even common mathematicians, do not know
anything of what some general expression may mean to the student of
molecular physics. In the books—the books that tramp has hidden—there
are marvels, miracles! But this was not a method, it was an idea, that
might lead to a method by which it would be possible, without changing
any other property of matter—except, in some instances colours—to lower
the refractive index of a substance, solid or liquid, to that of air—so
far as all practical purposes are concerned.”

“Phew!” said Kemp. “That’s odd! But still I don’t see quite ... I can
understand that thereby you could spoil a valuable stone, but personal
invisibility is a far cry.”

“Precisely,” said Griffin. “But consider, visibility depends on the
action of the visible bodies on light. Either a body absorbs light, or
it reflects or refracts it, or does all these things. If it neither
reflects nor refracts nor absorbs light, it cannot of itself be
visible. You see an opaque red box, for instance, because the colour
absorbs some of the light and reflects the rest, all the red part of
the light, to you. If it did not absorb any particular part of the
light, but reflected it all, then it would be a shining white box.
Silver! A diamond box would neither absorb much of the light nor
reflect much from the general surface, but just here and there where
the surfaces were favourable the light would be reflected and
refracted, so that you would get a brilliant appearance of flashing
reflections and translucencies—a sort of skeleton of light. A glass box
would not be so brilliant, nor so clearly visible, as a diamond box,
because there would be less refraction and reflection. See that? From
certain points of view you would see quite clearly through it. Some
kinds of glass would be more visible than others, a box of flint glass
would be brighter than a box of ordinary window glass. A box of very
thin common glass would be hard to see in a bad light, because it would
absorb hardly any light and refract and reflect very little. And if you
put a sheet of common white glass in water, still more if you put it in
some denser liquid than water, it would vanish almost altogether,
because light passing from water to glass is only slightly refracted or
reflected or indeed affected in any way. It is almost as invisible as a
jet of coal gas or hydrogen is in air. And for precisely the same
reason!”

“Yes,” said Kemp, “that is pretty plain sailing.”

“And here is another fact you will know to be true. If a sheet of glass
is smashed, Kemp, and beaten into a powder, it becomes much more
visible while it is in the air; it becomes at last an opaque white
powder. This is because the powdering multiplies the surfaces of the
glass at which refraction and reflection occur. In the sheet of glass
there are only two surfaces; in the powder the light is reflected or
refracted by each grain it passes through, and very little gets right
through the powder. But if the white powdered glass is put into water,
it forthwith vanishes. The powdered glass and water have much the same
refractive index; that is, the light undergoes very little refraction
or reflection in passing from one to the other.

“You make the glass invisible by putting it into a liquid of nearly the
same refractive index; a transparent thing becomes invisible if it is
put in any medium of almost the same refractive index. And if you will
consider only a second, you will see also that the powder of glass
might be made to vanish in air, if its refractive index could be made
the same as that of air; for then there would be no refraction or
reflection as the light passed from glass to air.”

“Yes, yes,” said Kemp. “But a man’s not powdered glass!”

“No,” said Griffin. “He’s more transparent!”

“Nonsense!”

“That from a doctor! How one forgets! Have you already forgotten your
physics, in ten years? Just think of all the things that are
transparent and seem not to be so. Paper, for instance, is made up of
transparent fibres, and it is white and opaque only for the same reason
that a powder of glass is white and opaque. Oil white paper, fill up
the interstices between the particles with oil so that there is no
longer refraction or reflection except at the surfaces, and it becomes
as transparent as glass. And not only paper, but cotton fibre, linen
fibre, wool fibre, woody fibre, and _bone_, Kemp, _flesh_, Kemp,
_hair_, Kemp, _nails_ and _nerves_, Kemp, in fact the whole fabric of a
man except the red of his blood and the black pigment of hair, are all
made up of transparent, colourless tissue. So little suffices to make
us visible one to the other. For the most part the fibres of a living
creature are no more opaque than water.”

“Great Heavens!” cried Kemp. “Of course, of course! I was thinking only
last night of the sea larvae and all jelly-fish!”

“_Now_ you have me! And all that I knew and had in mind a year after I
left London—six years ago. But I kept it to myself. I had to do my work
under frightful disadvantages. Oliver, my professor, was a scientific
bounder, a journalist by instinct, a thief of ideas—he was always
prying! And you know the knavish system of the scientific world. I
simply would not publish, and let him share my credit. I went on
working; I got nearer and nearer making my formula into an experiment,
a reality. I told no living soul, because I meant to flash my work upon
the world with crushing effect and become famous at a blow. I took up
the question of pigments to fill up certain gaps. And suddenly, not by
design but by accident, I made a discovery in physiology.”

“Yes?”

“You know the red colouring matter of blood; it can be made
white—colourless—and remain with all the functions it has now!”

Kemp gave a cry of incredulous amazement.

The Invisible Man rose and began pacing the little study. “You may well
exclaim. I remember that night. It was late at night—in the daytime one
was bothered with the gaping, silly students—and I worked then
sometimes till dawn. It came suddenly, splendid and complete in my
mind. I was alone; the laboratory was still, with the tall lights
burning brightly and silently. In all my great moments I have been
alone. ‘One could make an animal—a tissue—transparent! One could make
it invisible! All except the pigments—I could be invisible!’ I said,
suddenly realising what it meant to be an albino with such knowledge.
It was overwhelming. I left the filtering I was doing, and went and
stared out of the great window at the stars. ‘I could be invisible!’ I
repeated.

“To do such a thing would be to transcend magic. And I beheld,
unclouded by doubt, a magnificent vision of all that invisibility might
mean to a man—the mystery, the power, the freedom. Drawbacks I saw
none. You have only to think! And I, a shabby, poverty-struck,
hemmed-in demonstrator, teaching fools in a provincial college, might
suddenly become—this. I ask you, Kemp if _you_ ... Anyone, I tell you,
would have flung himself upon that research. And I worked three years,
and every mountain of difficulty I toiled over showed another from its
summit. The infinite details! And the exasperation! A professor, a
provincial professor, always prying. ‘When are you going to publish
this work of yours?’ was his everlasting question. And the students,
the cramped means! Three years I had of it—

“And after three years of secrecy and exasperation, I found that to
complete it was impossible—impossible.”

“How?” asked Kemp.

“Money,” said the Invisible Man, and went again to stare out of the
window.

He turned around abruptly. “I robbed the old man—robbed my father.

“The money was not his, and he shot himself.”




CHAPTER XX.
AT THE HOUSE IN GREAT PORTLAND STREET


For a moment Kemp sat in silence, staring at the back of the headless
figure at the window. Then he started, struck by a thought, rose, took
the Invisible Man’s arm, and turned him away from the outlook.

“You are tired,” he said, “and while I sit, you walk about. Have my
chair.”

He placed himself between Griffin and the nearest window.

For a space Griffin sat silent, and then he resumed abruptly:

“I had left the Chesilstowe cottage already,” he said, “when that
happened. It was last December. I had taken a room in London, a large
unfurnished room in a big ill-managed lodging-house in a slum near
Great Portland Street. The room was soon full of the appliances I had
bought with his money; the work was going on steadily, successfully,
drawing near an end. I was like a man emerging from a thicket, and
suddenly coming on some unmeaning tragedy. I went to bury him. My mind
was still on this research, and I did not lift a finger to save his
character. I remember the funeral, the cheap hearse, the scant
ceremony, the windy frost-bitten hillside, and the old college friend
of his who read the service over him—a shabby, black, bent old man with
a snivelling cold.

“I remember walking back to the empty house, through the place that had
once been a village and was now patched and tinkered by the jerry
builders into the ugly likeness of a town. Every way the roads ran out
at last into the desecrated fields and ended in rubble heaps and rank
wet weeds. I remember myself as a gaunt black figure, going along the
slippery, shiny pavement, and the strange sense of detachment I felt
from the squalid respectability, the sordid commercialism of the place.

“I did not feel a bit sorry for my father. He seemed to me to be the
victim of his own foolish sentimentality. The current cant required my
attendance at his funeral, but it was really not my affair.

“But going along the High Street, my old life came back to me for a
space, for I met the girl I had known ten years since. Our eyes met.

“Something moved me to turn back and talk to her. She was a very
ordinary person.

“It was all like a dream, that visit to the old places. I did not feel
then that I was lonely, that I had come out from the world into a
desolate place. I appreciated my loss of sympathy, but I put it down to
the general inanity of things. Re-entering my room seemed like the
recovery of reality. There were the things I knew and loved. There
stood the apparatus, the experiments arranged and waiting. And now
there was scarcely a difficulty left, beyond the planning of details.

“I will tell you, Kemp, sooner or later, all the complicated processes.
We need not go into that now. For the most part, saving certain gaps I
chose to remember, they are written in cypher in those books that tramp
has hidden. We must hunt him down. We must get those books again. But
the essential phase was to place the transparent object whose
refractive index was to be lowered between two radiating centres of a
sort of ethereal vibration, of which I will tell you more fully later.
No, not those Röntgen vibrations—I don’t know that these others of mine
have been described. Yet they are obvious enough. I needed two little
dynamos, and these I worked with a cheap gas engine. My first
experiment was with a bit of white wool fabric. It was the strangest
thing in the world to see it in the flicker of the flashes soft and
white, and then to watch it fade like a wreath of smoke and vanish.

“I could scarcely believe I had done it. I put my hand into the
emptiness, and there was the thing as solid as ever. I felt it
awkwardly, and threw it on the floor. I had a little trouble finding it
again.

“And then came a curious experience. I heard a miaow behind me, and
turning, saw a lean white cat, very dirty, on the cistern cover outside
the window. A thought came into my head. ‘Everything ready for you,’ I
said, and went to the window, opened it, and called softly. She came
in, purring—the poor beast was starving—and I gave her some milk. All
my food was in a cupboard in the corner of the room. After that she
went smelling round the room, evidently with the idea of making herself
at home. The invisible rag upset her a bit; you should have seen her
spit at it! But I made her comfortable on the pillow of my truckle-bed.
And I gave her butter to get her to wash.”

“And you processed her?”

“I processed her. But giving drugs to a cat is no joke, Kemp! And the
process failed.”

“Failed!”

“In two particulars. These were the claws and the pigment stuff, what
is it?—at the back of the eye in a cat. You know?”

“_Tapetum_.”

“Yes, the _tapetum_. It didn’t go. After I’d given the stuff to bleach
the blood and done certain other things to her, I gave the beast opium,
and put her and the pillow she was sleeping on, on the apparatus. And
after all the rest had faded and vanished, there remained two little
ghosts of her eyes.”

“Odd!”

“I can’t explain it. She was bandaged and clamped, of course—so I had
her safe; but she woke while she was still misty, and miaowed dismally,
and someone came knocking. It was an old woman from downstairs, who
suspected me of vivisecting—a drink-sodden old creature, with only a
white cat to care for in all the world. I whipped out some chloroform,
applied it, and answered the door. ‘Did I hear a cat?’ she asked. ‘My
cat?’ ‘Not here,’ said I, very politely. She was a little doubtful and
tried to peer past me into the room; strange enough to her no
doubt—bare walls, uncurtained windows, truckle-bed, with the gas engine
vibrating, and the seethe of the radiant points, and that faint ghastly
stinging of chloroform in the air. She had to be satisfied at last and
went away again.”

“How long did it take?” asked Kemp.

“Three or four hours—the cat. The bones and sinews and the fat were the
last to go, and the tips of the coloured hairs. And, as I say, the back
part of the eye, tough, iridescent stuff it is, wouldn’t go at all.

“It was night outside long before the business was over, and nothing
was to be seen but the dim eyes and the claws. I stopped the gas
engine, felt for and stroked the beast, which was still insensible, and
then, being tired, left it sleeping on the invisible pillow and went to
bed. I found it hard to sleep. I lay awake thinking weak aimless stuff,
going over the experiment over and over again, or dreaming feverishly
of things growing misty and vanishing about me, until everything, the
ground I stood on, vanished, and so I came to that sickly falling
nightmare one gets. About two, the cat began miaowing about the room. I
tried to hush it by talking to it, and then I decided to turn it out. I
remember the shock I had when striking a light—there were just the
round eyes shining green—and nothing round them. I would have given it
milk, but I hadn’t any. It wouldn’t be quiet, it just sat down and
miaowed at the door. I tried to catch it, with an idea of putting it
out of the window, but it wouldn’t be caught, it vanished. Then it
began miaowing in different parts of the room. At last I opened the
window and made a bustle. I suppose it went out at last. I never saw
any more of it.

“Then—Heaven knows why—I fell thinking of my father’s funeral again,
and the dismal windy hillside, until the day had come. I found sleeping
was hopeless, and, locking my door after me, wandered out into the
morning streets.”

“You don’t mean to say there’s an invisible cat at large!” said Kemp.

“If it hasn’t been killed,” said the Invisible Man. “Why not?”

“Why not?” said Kemp. “I didn’t mean to interrupt.”

“It’s very probably been killed,” said the Invisible Man. “It was alive
four days after, I know, and down a grating in Great Titchfield Street;
because I saw a crowd round the place, trying to see whence the
miaowing came.”

He was silent for the best part of a minute. Then he resumed abruptly:

“I remember that morning before the change very vividly. I must have
gone up Great Portland Street. I remember the barracks in Albany
Street, and the horse soldiers coming out, and at last I found the
summit of Primrose Hill. It was a sunny day in January—one of those
sunny, frosty days that came before the snow this year. My weary brain
tried to formulate the position, to plot out a plan of action.

“I was surprised to find, now that my prize was within my grasp, how
inconclusive its attainment seemed. As a matter of fact I was worked
out; the intense stress of nearly four years’ continuous work left me
incapable of any strength of feeling. I was apathetic, and I tried in
vain to recover the enthusiasm of my first inquiries, the passion of
discovery that had enabled me to compass even the downfall of my
father’s grey hairs. Nothing seemed to matter. I saw pretty clearly
this was a transient mood, due to overwork and want of sleep, and that
either by drugs or rest it would be possible to recover my energies.

“All I could think clearly was that the thing had to be carried
through; the fixed idea still ruled me. And soon, for the money I had
was almost exhausted. I looked about me at the hillside, with children
playing and girls watching them, and tried to think of all the
fantastic advantages an invisible man would have in the world. After a
time I crawled home, took some food and a strong dose of strychnine,
and went to sleep in my clothes on my unmade bed. Strychnine is a grand
tonic, Kemp, to take the flabbiness out of a man.”

“It’s the devil,” said Kemp. “It’s the palaeolithic in a bottle.”

“I awoke vastly invigorated and rather irritable. You know?”

“I know the stuff.”

“And there was someone rapping at the door. It was my landlord with
threats and inquiries, an old Polish Jew in a long grey coat and greasy
slippers. I had been tormenting a cat in the night, he was sure—the old
woman’s tongue had been busy. He insisted on knowing all about it. The
laws in this country against vivisection were very severe—he might be
liable. I denied the cat. Then the vibration of the little gas engine
could be felt all over the house, he said. That was true, certainly. He
edged round me into the room, peering about over his German-silver
spectacles, and a sudden dread came into my mind that he might carry
away something of my secret. I tried to keep between him and the
concentrating apparatus I had arranged, and that only made him more
curious. What was I doing? Why was I always alone and secretive? Was it
legal? Was it dangerous? I paid nothing but the usual rent. His had
always been a most respectable house—in a disreputable neighbourhood.
Suddenly my temper gave way. I told him to get out. He began to
protest, to jabber of his right of entry. In a moment I had him by the
collar; something ripped, and he went spinning out into his own
passage. I slammed and locked the door and sat down quivering.

“He made a fuss outside, which I disregarded, and after a time he went
away.

“But this brought matters to a crisis. I did not know what he would do,
nor even what he had the power to do. To move to fresh apartments would
have meant delay; altogether I had barely twenty pounds left in the
world, for the most part in a bank—and I could not afford that. Vanish!
It was irresistible. Then there would be an inquiry, the sacking of my
room.

“At the thought of the possibility of my work being exposed or
interrupted at its very climax, I became very angry and active. I
hurried out with my three books of notes, my cheque-book—the tramp has
them now—and directed them from the nearest Post Office to a house of
call for letters and parcels in Great Portland Street. I tried to go
out noiselessly. Coming in, I found my landlord going quietly upstairs;
he had heard the door close, I suppose. You would have laughed to see
him jump aside on the landing as I came tearing after him. He glared at
me as I went by him, and I made the house quiver with the slamming of
my door. I heard him come shuffling up to my floor, hesitate, and go
down. I set to work upon my preparations forthwith.

“It was all done that evening and night. While I was still sitting
under the sickly, drowsy influence of the drugs that decolourise blood,
there came a repeated knocking at the door. It ceased, footsteps went
away and returned, and the knocking was resumed. There was an attempt
to push something under the door—a blue paper. Then in a fit of
irritation I rose and went and flung the door wide open. ‘Now then?’
said I.

“It was my landlord, with a notice of ejectment or something. He held
it out to me, saw something odd about my hands, I expect, and lifted
his eyes to my face.

“For a moment he gaped. Then he gave a sort of inarticulate cry,
dropped candle and writ together, and went blundering down the dark
passage to the stairs. I shut the door, locked it, and went to the
looking-glass. Then I understood his terror.... My face was white—like
white stone.

“But it was all horrible. I had not expected the suffering. A night of
racking anguish, sickness and fainting. I set my teeth, though my skin
was presently afire, all my body afire; but I lay there like grim
death. I understood now how it was the cat had howled until I
chloroformed it. Lucky it was I lived alone and untended in my room.
There were times when I sobbed and groaned and talked. But I stuck to
it.... I became insensible and woke languid in the darkness.

“The pain had passed. I thought I was killing myself and I did not
care. I shall never forget that dawn, and the strange horror of seeing
that my hands had become as clouded glass, and watching them grow
clearer and thinner as the day went by, until at last I could see the
sickly disorder of my room through them, though I closed my transparent
eyelids. My limbs became glassy, the bones and arteries faded,
vanished, and the little white nerves went last. I gritted my teeth and
stayed there to the end. At last only the dead tips of the fingernails
remained, pallid and white, and the brown stain of some acid upon my
fingers.

“I struggled up. At first I was as incapable as a swathed
infant—stepping with limbs I could not see. I was weak and very hungry.
I went and stared at nothing in my shaving-glass, at nothing save where
an attenuated pigment still remained behind the retina of my eyes,
fainter than mist. I had to hang on to the table and press my forehead
against the glass.

“It was only by a frantic effort of will that I dragged myself back to
the apparatus and completed the process.

“I slept during the forenoon, pulling the sheet over my eyes to shut
out the light, and about midday I was awakened again by a knocking. My
strength had returned. I sat up and listened and heard a whispering. I
sprang to my feet and as noiselessly as possible began to detach the
connections of my apparatus, and to distribute it about the room, so as
to destroy the suggestions of its arrangement. Presently the knocking
was renewed and voices called, first my landlord’s, and then two
others. To gain time I answered them. The invisible rag and pillow came
to hand and I opened the window and pitched them out on to the cistern
cover. As the window opened, a heavy crash came at the door. Someone
had charged it with the idea of smashing the lock. But the stout bolts
I had screwed up some days before stopped him. That startled me, made
me angry. I began to tremble and do things hurriedly.

“I tossed together some loose paper, straw, packing paper and so forth,
in the middle of the room, and turned on the gas. Heavy blows began to
rain upon the door. I could not find the matches. I beat my hands on
the wall with rage. I turned down the gas again, stepped out of the
window on the cistern cover, very softly lowered the sash, and sat
down, secure and invisible, but quivering with anger, to watch events.
They split a panel, I saw, and in another moment they had broken away
the staples of the bolts and stood in the open doorway. It was the
landlord and his two step-sons, sturdy young men of three or four and
twenty. Behind them fluttered the old hag of a woman from downstairs.

“You may imagine their astonishment to find the room empty. One of the
younger men rushed to the window at once, flung it up and stared out.
His staring eyes and thick-lipped bearded face came a foot from my
face. I was half minded to hit his silly countenance, but I arrested my
doubled fist. He stared right through me. So did the others as they
joined him. The old man went and peered under the bed, and then they
all made a rush for the cupboard. They had to argue about it at length
in Yiddish and Cockney English. They concluded I had not answered them,
that their imagination had deceived them. A feeling of extraordinary
elation took the place of my anger as I sat outside the window and
watched these four people—for the old lady came in, glancing
suspiciously about her like a cat, trying to understand the riddle of
my behaviour.

“The old man, so far as I could understand his _patois_, agreed with
the old lady that I was a vivisectionist. The sons protested in garbled
English that I was an electrician, and appealed to the dynamos and
radiators. They were all nervous about my arrival, although I found
subsequently that they had bolted the front door. The old lady peered
into the cupboard and under the bed, and one of the young men pushed up
the register and stared up the chimney. One of my fellow lodgers, a
coster-monger who shared the opposite room with a butcher, appeared on
the landing, and he was called in and told incoherent things.

“It occurred to me that the radiators, if they fell into the hands of
some acute well-educated person, would give me away too much, and
watching my opportunity, I came into the room and tilted one of the
little dynamos off its fellow on which it was standing, and smashed
both apparatus. Then, while they were trying to explain the smash, I
dodged out of the room and went softly downstairs.

“I went into one of the sitting-rooms and waited until they came down,
still speculating and argumentative, all a little disappointed at
finding no ‘horrors,’ and all a little puzzled how they stood legally
towards me. Then I slipped up again with a box of matches, fired my
heap of paper and rubbish, put the chairs and bedding thereby, led the
gas to the affair, by means of an india-rubber tube, and waving a
farewell to the room left it for the last time.”

“You fired the house!” exclaimed Kemp.

“Fired the house. It was the only way to cover my trail—and no doubt it
was insured. I slipped the bolts of the front door quietly and went out
into the street. I was invisible, and I was only just beginning to
realise the extraordinary advantage my invisibility gave me. My head
was already teeming with plans of all the wild and wonderful things I
had now impunity to do.”




CHAPTER XXI.
IN OXFORD STREET


“In going downstairs the first time I found an unexpected difficulty
because I could not see my feet; indeed I stumbled twice, and there was
an unaccustomed clumsiness in gripping the bolt. By not looking down,
however, I managed to walk on the level passably well.

“My mood, I say, was one of exaltation. I felt as a seeing man might
do, with padded feet and noiseless clothes, in a city of the blind. I
experienced a wild impulse to jest, to startle people, to clap men on
the back, fling people’s hats astray, and generally revel in my
extraordinary advantage.

“But hardly had I emerged upon Great Portland Street, however (my
lodging was close to the big draper’s shop there), when I heard a
clashing concussion and was hit violently behind, and turning saw a man
carrying a basket of soda-water syphons, and looking in amazement at
his burden. Although the blow had really hurt me, I found something so
irresistible in his astonishment that I laughed aloud. ‘The devil’s in
the basket,’ I said, and suddenly twisted it out of his hand. He let go
incontinently, and I swung the whole weight into the air.

“But a fool of a cabman, standing outside a public house, made a sudden
rush for this, and his extending fingers took me with excruciating
violence under the ear. I let the whole down with a smash on the
cabman, and then, with shouts and the clatter of feet about me, people
coming out of shops, vehicles pulling up, I realised what I had done
for myself, and cursing my folly, backed against a shop window and
prepared to dodge out of the confusion. In a moment I should be wedged
into a crowd and inevitably discovered. I pushed by a butcher boy, who
luckily did not turn to see the nothingness that shoved him aside, and
dodged behind the cab-man’s four-wheeler. I do not know how they
settled the business. I hurried straight across the road, which was
happily clear, and hardly heeding which way I went, in the fright of
detection the incident had given me, plunged into the afternoon throng
of Oxford Street.

“I tried to get into the stream of people, but they were too thick for
me, and in a moment my heels were being trodden upon. I took to the
gutter, the roughness of which I found painful to my feet, and
forthwith the shaft of a crawling hansom dug me forcibly under the
shoulder blade, reminding me that I was already bruised severely. I
staggered out of the way of the cab, avoided a perambulator by a
convulsive movement, and found myself behind the hansom. A happy
thought saved me, and as this drove slowly along I followed in its
immediate wake, trembling and astonished at the turn of my adventure.
And not only trembling, but shivering. It was a bright day in January
and I was stark naked and the thin slime of mud that covered the road
was freezing. Foolish as it seems to me now, I had not reckoned that,
transparent or not, I was still amenable to the weather and all its
consequences.

“Then suddenly a bright idea came into my head. I ran round and got
into the cab. And so, shivering, scared, and sniffing with the first
intimations of a cold, and with the bruises in the small of my back
growing upon my attention, I drove slowly along Oxford Street and past
Tottenham Court Road. My mood was as different from that in which I had
sallied forth ten minutes ago as it is possible to imagine. This
invisibility indeed! The one thought that possessed me was—how was I to
get out of the scrape I was in.

“We crawled past Mudie’s, and there a tall woman with five or six
yellow-labelled books hailed my cab, and I sprang out just in time to
escape her, shaving a railway van narrowly in my flight. I made off up
the roadway to Bloomsbury Square, intending to strike north past the
Museum and so get into the quiet district. I was now cruelly chilled,
and the strangeness of my situation so unnerved me that I whimpered as
I ran. At the northward corner of the Square a little white dog ran out
of the Pharmaceutical Society’s offices, and incontinently made for me,
nose down.

“I had never realised it before, but the nose is to the mind of a dog
what the eye is to the mind of a seeing man. Dogs perceive the scent of
a man moving as men perceive his vision. This brute began barking and
leaping, showing, as it seemed to me, only too plainly that he was
aware of me. I crossed Great Russell Street, glancing over my shoulder
as I did so, and went some way along Montague Street before I realised
what I was running towards.

“Then I became aware of a blare of music, and looking along the street
saw a number of people advancing out of Russell Square, red shirts, and
the banner of the Salvation Army to the fore. Such a crowd, chanting in
the roadway and scoffing on the pavement, I could not hope to
penetrate, and dreading to go back and farther from home again, and
deciding on the spur of the moment, I ran up the white steps of a house
facing the museum railings, and stood there until the crowd should have
passed. Happily the dog stopped at the noise of the band too,
hesitated, and turned tail, running back to Bloomsbury Square again.

“On came the band, bawling with unconscious irony some hymn about ‘When
shall we see His face?’ and it seemed an interminable time to me before
the tide of the crowd washed along the pavement by me. Thud, thud,
thud, came the drum with a vibrating resonance, and for the moment I
did not notice two urchins stopping at the railings by me. ‘See ’em,’
said one. ‘See what?’ said the other. ‘Why—them footmarks—bare. Like
what you makes in mud.’

“I looked down and saw the youngsters had stopped and were gaping at
the muddy footmarks I had left behind me up the newly whitened steps.
The passing people elbowed and jostled them, but their confounded
intelligence was arrested. ‘Thud, thud, thud, when, thud, shall we see,
thud, his face, thud, thud.’ ‘There’s a barefoot man gone up them
steps, or I don’t know nothing,’ said one. ‘And he ain’t never come
down again. And his foot was a-bleeding.’

“The thick of the crowd had already passed. ‘Looky there, Ted,’ quoth
the younger of the detectives, with the sharpness of surprise in his
voice, and pointed straight to my feet. I looked down and saw at once
the dim suggestion of their outline sketched in splashes of mud. For a
moment I was paralysed.

“‘Why, that’s rum,’ said the elder. ‘Dashed rum! It’s just like the
ghost of a foot, ain’t it?’ He hesitated and advanced with outstretched
hand. A man pulled up short to see what he was catching, and then a
girl. In another moment he would have touched me. Then I saw what to
do. I made a step, the boy started back with an exclamation, and with a
rapid movement I swung myself over into the portico of the next house.
But the smaller boy was sharp-eyed enough to follow the movement, and
before I was well down the steps and upon the pavement, he had
recovered from his momentary astonishment and was shouting out that the
feet had gone over the wall.

“They rushed round and saw my new footmarks flash into being on the
lower step and upon the pavement. ‘What’s up?’ asked someone. ‘Feet!
Look! Feet running!’

“Everybody in the road, except my three pursuers, was pouring along
after the Salvation Army, and this blow not only impeded me but them.
There was an eddy of surprise and interrogation. At the cost of bowling
over one young fellow I got through, and in another moment I was
rushing headlong round the circuit of Russell Square, with six or seven
astonished people following my footmarks. There was no time for
explanation, or else the whole host would have been after me.

“Twice I doubled round corners, thrice I crossed the road and came back
upon my tracks, and then, as my feet grew hot and dry, the damp
impressions began to fade. At last I had a breathing space and rubbed
my feet clean with my hands, and so got away altogether. The last I saw
of the chase was a little group of a dozen people perhaps, studying
with infinite perplexity a slowly drying footprint that had resulted
from a puddle in Tavistock Square, a footprint as isolated and
incomprehensible to them as Crusoe’s solitary discovery.

“This running warmed me to a certain extent, and I went on with a
better courage through the maze of less frequented roads that runs
hereabouts. My back had now become very stiff and sore, my tonsils were
painful from the cabman’s fingers, and the skin of my neck had been
scratched by his nails; my feet hurt exceedingly and I was lame from a
little cut on one foot. I saw in time a blind man approaching me, and
fled limping, for I feared his subtle intuitions. Once or twice
accidental collisions occurred and I left people amazed, with
unaccountable curses ringing in their ears. Then came something silent
and quiet against my face, and across the Square fell a thin veil of
slowly falling flakes of snow. I had caught a cold, and do as I would I
could not avoid an occasional sneeze. And every dog that came in sight,
with its pointing nose and curious sniffing, was a terror to me.

“Then came men and boys running, first one and then others, and
shouting as they ran. It was a fire. They ran in the direction of my
lodging, and looking back down a street I saw a mass of black smoke
streaming up above the roofs and telephone wires. It was my lodging
burning; my clothes, my apparatus, all my resources indeed, except my
cheque-book and the three volumes of memoranda that awaited me in Great
Portland Street, were there. Burning! I had burnt my boats—if ever a
man did! The place was blazing.”

The Invisible Man paused and thought. Kemp glanced nervously out of the
window. “Yes?” he said. “Go on.”




CHAPTER XXII.
IN THE EMPORIUM


“So last January, with the beginning of a snowstorm in the air about
me—and if it settled on me it would betray me!—weary, cold, painful,
inexpressibly wretched, and still but half convinced of my invisible
quality, I began this new life to which I am committed. I had no
refuge, no appliances, no human being in the world in whom I could
confide. To have told my secret would have given me away—made a mere
show and rarity of me. Nevertheless, I was half-minded to accost some
passer-by and throw myself upon his mercy. But I knew too clearly the
terror and brutal cruelty my advances would evoke. I made no plans in
the street. My sole object was to get shelter from the snow, to get
myself covered and warm; then I might hope to plan. But even to me, an
Invisible Man, the rows of London houses stood latched, barred, and
bolted impregnably.

“Only one thing could I see clearly before me—the cold exposure and
misery of the snowstorm and the night.

“And then I had a brilliant idea. I turned down one of the roads
leading from Gower Street to Tottenham Court Road, and found myself
outside Omniums, the big establishment where everything is to be
bought—you know the place: meat, grocery, linen, furniture, clothing,
oil paintings even—a huge meandering collection of shops rather than a
shop. I had thought I should find the doors open, but they were closed,
and as I stood in the wide entrance a carriage stopped outside, and a
man in uniform—you know the kind of personage with ‘Omnium’ on his
cap—flung open the door. I contrived to enter, and walking down the
shop—it was a department where they were selling ribbons and gloves and
stockings and that kind of thing—came to a more spacious region devoted
to picnic baskets and wicker furniture.

“I did not feel safe there, however; people were going to and fro, and
I prowled restlessly about until I came upon a huge section in an upper
floor containing multitudes of bedsteads, and over these I clambered,
and found a resting-place at last among a huge pile of folded flock
mattresses. The place was already lit up and agreeably warm, and I
decided to remain where I was, keeping a cautious eye on the two or
three sets of shopmen and customers who were meandering through the
place, until closing time came. Then I should be able, I thought, to
rob the place for food and clothing, and disguised, prowl through it
and examine its resources, perhaps sleep on some of the bedding. That
seemed an acceptable plan. My idea was to procure clothing to make
myself a muffled but acceptable figure, to get money, and then to
recover my books and parcels where they awaited me, take a lodging
somewhere and elaborate plans for the complete realisation of the
advantages my invisibility gave me (as I still imagined) over my
fellow-men.

“Closing time arrived quickly enough. It could not have been more than
an hour after I took up my position on the mattresses before I noticed
the blinds of the windows being drawn, and customers being marched
doorward. And then a number of brisk young men began with remarkable
alacrity to tidy up the goods that remained disturbed. I left my lair
as the crowds diminished, and prowled cautiously out into the less
desolate parts of the shop. I was really surprised to observe how
rapidly the young men and women whipped away the goods displayed for
sale during the day. All the boxes of goods, the hanging fabrics, the
festoons of lace, the boxes of sweets in the grocery section, the
displays of this and that, were being whipped down, folded up, slapped
into tidy receptacles, and everything that could not be taken down and
put away had sheets of some coarse stuff like sacking flung over them.
Finally all the chairs were turned up on to the counters, leaving the
floor clear. Directly each of these young people had done, he or she
made promptly for the door with such an expression of animation as I
have rarely observed in a shop assistant before. Then came a lot of
youngsters scattering sawdust and carrying pails and brooms. I had to
dodge to get out of the way, and as it was, my ankle got stung with the
sawdust. For some time, wandering through the swathed and darkened
departments, I could hear the brooms at work. And at last a good hour
or more after the shop had been closed, came a noise of locking doors.
Silence came upon the place, and I found myself wandering through the
vast and intricate shops, galleries, show-rooms of the place, alone. It
was very still; in one place I remember passing near one of the
Tottenham Court Road entrances and listening to the tapping of
boot-heels of the passers-by.

“My first visit was to the place where I had seen stockings and gloves
for sale. It was dark, and I had the devil of a hunt after matches,
which I found at last in the drawer of the little cash desk. Then I had
to get a candle. I had to tear down wrappings and ransack a number of
boxes and drawers, but at last I managed to turn out what I sought; the
box label called them lambswool pants, and lambswool vests. Then socks,
a thick comforter, and then I went to the clothing place and got
trousers, a lounge jacket, an overcoat and a slouch hat—a clerical sort
of hat with the brim turned down. I began to feel a human being again,
and my next thought was food.

“Upstairs was a refreshment department, and there I got cold meat.
There was coffee still in the urn, and I lit the gas and warmed it up
again, and altogether I did not do badly. Afterwards, prowling through
the place in search of blankets—I had to put up at last with a heap of
down quilts—I came upon a grocery section with a lot of chocolate and
candied fruits, more than was good for me indeed—and some white
burgundy. And near that was a toy department, and I had a brilliant
idea. I found some artificial noses—dummy noses, you know, and I
thought of dark spectacles. But Omniums had no optical department. My
nose had been a difficulty indeed—I had thought of paint. But the
discovery set my mind running on wigs and masks and the like. Finally I
went to sleep in a heap of down quilts, very warm and comfortable.

“My last thoughts before sleeping were the most agreeable I had had
since the change. I was in a state of physical serenity, and that was
reflected in my mind. I thought that I should be able to slip out
unobserved in the morning with my clothes upon me, muffling my face
with a white wrapper I had taken, purchase, with the money I had taken,
spectacles and so forth, and so complete my disguise. I lapsed into
disorderly dreams of all the fantastic things that had happened during
the last few days. I saw the ugly little Jew of a landlord vociferating
in his rooms; I saw his two sons marvelling, and the wrinkled old
woman’s gnarled face as she asked for her cat. I experienced again the
strange sensation of seeing the cloth disappear, and so I came round to
the windy hillside and the sniffing old clergyman mumbling ‘Earth to
earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust,’ at my father’s open grave.

“‘You also,’ said a voice, and suddenly I was being forced towards the
grave. I struggled, shouted, appealed to the mourners, but they
continued stonily following the service; the old clergyman, too, never
faltered droning and sniffing through the ritual. I realised I was
invisible and inaudible, that overwhelming forces had their grip on me.
I struggled in vain, I was forced over the brink, the coffin rang
hollow as I fell upon it, and the gravel came flying after me in
spadefuls. Nobody heeded me, nobody was aware of me. I made convulsive
struggles and awoke.

“The pale London dawn had come, the place was full of a chilly grey
light that filtered round the edges of the window blinds. I sat up, and
for a time I could not think where this ample apartment, with its
counters, its piles of rolled stuff, its heap of quilts and cushions,
its iron pillars, might be. Then, as recollection came back to me, I
heard voices in conversation.

“Then far down the place, in the brighter light of some department
which had already raised its blinds, I saw two men approaching. I
scrambled to my feet, looking about me for some way of escape, and even
as I did so the sound of my movement made them aware of me. I suppose
they saw merely a figure moving quietly and quickly away. ‘Who’s that?’
cried one, and ‘Stop there!’ shouted the other. I dashed around a
corner and came full tilt—a faceless figure, mind you!—on a lanky lad
of fifteen. He yelled and I bowled him over, rushed past him, turned
another corner, and by a happy inspiration threw myself behind a
counter. In another moment feet went running past and I heard voices
shouting, ‘All hands to the doors!’ asking what was ‘up,’ and giving
one another advice how to catch me.

“Lying on the ground, I felt scared out of my wits. But—odd as it may
seem—it did not occur to me at the moment to take off my clothes as I
should have done. I had made up my mind, I suppose, to get away in
them, and that ruled me. And then down the vista of the counters came a
bawling of ‘Here he is!’

“I sprang to my feet, whipped a chair off the counter, and sent it
whirling at the fool who had shouted, turned, came into another round a
corner, sent him spinning, and rushed up the stairs. He kept his
footing, gave a view hallo, and came up the staircase hot after me. Up
the staircase were piled a multitude of those bright-coloured pot
things—what are they?”

“Art pots,” suggested Kemp.

“That’s it! Art pots. Well, I turned at the top step and swung round,
plucked one out of a pile and smashed it on his silly head as he came
at me. The whole pile of pots went headlong, and I heard shouting and
footsteps running from all parts. I made a mad rush for the refreshment
place, and there was a man in white like a man cook, who took up the
chase. I made one last desperate turn and found myself among lamps and
ironmongery. I went behind the counter of this, and waited for my cook,
and as he bolted in at the head of the chase, I doubled him up with a
lamp. Down he went, and I crouched down behind the counter and began
whipping off my clothes as fast as I could. Coat, jacket, trousers,
shoes were all right, but a lambswool vest fits a man like a skin. I
heard more men coming, my cook was lying quiet on the other side of the
counter, stunned or scared speechless, and I had to make another dash
for it, like a rabbit hunted out of a wood-pile.

“‘This way, policeman!’ I heard someone shouting. I found myself in my
bedstead storeroom again, and at the end of a wilderness of wardrobes.
I rushed among them, went flat, got rid of my vest after infinite
wriggling, and stood a free man again, panting and scared, as the
policeman and three of the shopmen came round the corner. They made a
rush for the vest and pants, and collared the trousers. ‘He’s dropping
his plunder,’ said one of the young men. ‘He _must_ be somewhere here.’

“But they did not find me all the same.

“I stood watching them hunt for me for a time, and cursing my ill-luck
in losing the clothes. Then I went into the refreshment-room, drank a
little milk I found there, and sat down by the fire to consider my
position.

“In a little while two assistants came in and began to talk over the
business very excitedly and like the fools they were. I heard a
magnified account of my depredations, and other speculations as to my
whereabouts. Then I fell to scheming again. The insurmountable
difficulty of the place, especially now it was alarmed, was to get any
plunder out of it. I went down into the warehouse to see if there was
any chance of packing and addressing a parcel, but I could not
understand the system of checking. About eleven o’clock, the snow
having thawed as it fell, and the day being finer and a little warmer
than the previous one, I decided that the Emporium was hopeless, and
went out again, exasperated at my want of success, with only the
vaguest plans of action in my mind.”




CHAPTER XXIII.
IN DRURY LANE


“But you begin now to realise,” said the Invisible Man, “the full
disadvantage of my condition. I had no shelter—no covering—to get
clothing was to forego all my advantage, to make myself a strange and
terrible thing. I was fasting; for to eat, to fill myself with
unassimilated matter, would be to become grotesquely visible again.”

“I never thought of that,” said Kemp.

“Nor had I. And the snow had warned me of other dangers. I could not go
abroad in snow—it would settle on me and expose me. Rain, too, would
make me a watery outline, a glistening surface of a man—a bubble. And
fog—I should be like a fainter bubble in a fog, a surface, a greasy
glimmer of humanity. Moreover, as I went abroad—in the London air—I
gathered dirt about my ankles, floating smuts and dust upon my skin. I
did not know how long it would be before I should become visible from
that cause also. But I saw clearly it could not be for long.

“Not in London at any rate.

“I went into the slums towards Great Portland Street, and found myself
at the end of the street in which I had lodged. I did not go that way,
because of the crowd halfway down it opposite to the still smoking
ruins of the house I had fired. My most immediate problem was to get
clothing. What to do with my face puzzled me. Then I saw in one of
those little miscellaneous shops—news, sweets, toys, stationery,
belated Christmas tomfoolery, and so forth—an array of masks and noses.
I realised that problem was solved. In a flash I saw my course. I
turned about, no longer aimless, and went—circuitously in order to
avoid the busy ways, towards the back streets north of the Strand; for
I remembered, though not very distinctly where, that some theatrical
costumiers had shops in that district.

“The day was cold, with a nipping wind down the northward running
streets. I walked fast to avoid being overtaken. Every crossing was a
danger, every passenger a thing to watch alertly. One man as I was
about to pass him at the top of Bedford Street, turned upon me abruptly
and came into me, sending me into the road and almost under the wheel
of a passing hansom. The verdict of the cab-rank was that he had had
some sort of stroke. I was so unnerved by this encounter that I went
into Covent Garden Market and sat down for some time in a quiet corner
by a stall of violets, panting and trembling. I found I had caught a
fresh cold, and had to turn out after a time lest my sneezes should
attract attention.

“At last I reached the object of my quest, a dirty, fly-blown little
shop in a by-way near Drury Lane, with a window full of tinsel robes,
sham jewels, wigs, slippers, dominoes and theatrical photographs. The
shop was old-fashioned and low and dark, and the house rose above it
for four storeys, dark and dismal. I peered through the window and,
seeing no one within, entered. The opening of the door set a clanking
bell ringing. I left it open, and walked round a bare costume stand,
into a corner behind a cheval glass. For a minute or so no one came.
Then I heard heavy feet striding across a room, and a man appeared down
the shop.

“My plans were now perfectly definite. I proposed to make my way into
the house, secrete myself upstairs, watch my opportunity, and when
everything was quiet, rummage out a wig, mask, spectacles, and costume,
and go into the world, perhaps a grotesque but still a credible figure.
And incidentally of course I could rob the house of any available
money.

“The man who had just entered the shop was a short, slight, hunched,
beetle-browed man, with long arms and very short bandy legs. Apparently
I had interrupted a meal. He stared about the shop with an expression
of expectation. This gave way to surprise, and then to anger, as he saw
the shop empty. ‘Damn the boys!’ he said. He went to stare up and down
the street. He came in again in a minute, kicked the door to with his
foot spitefully, and went muttering back to the house door.

“I came forward to follow him, and at the noise of my movement he
stopped dead. I did so too, startled by his quickness of ear. He
slammed the house door in my face.

“I stood hesitating. Suddenly I heard his quick footsteps returning,
and the door reopened. He stood looking about the shop like one who was
still not satisfied. Then, murmuring to himself, he examined the back
of the counter and peered behind some fixtures. Then he stood doubtful.
He had left the house door open and I slipped into the inner room.

“It was a queer little room, poorly furnished and with a number of big
masks in the corner. On the table was his belated breakfast, and it was
a confoundedly exasperating thing for me, Kemp, to have to sniff his
coffee and stand watching while he came in and resumed his meal. And
his table manners were irritating. Three doors opened into the little
room, one going upstairs and one down, but they were all shut. I could
not get out of the room while he was there; I could scarcely move
because of his alertness, and there was a draught down my back. Twice I
strangled a sneeze just in time.

“The spectacular quality of my sensations was curious and novel, but
for all that I was heartily tired and angry long before he had done his
eating. But at last he made an end and putting his beggarly crockery on
the black tin tray upon which he had had his teapot, and gathering all
the crumbs up on the mustard stained cloth, he took the whole lot of
things after him. His burden prevented his shutting the door behind
him—as he would have done; I never saw such a man for shutting
doors—and I followed him into a very dirty underground kitchen and
scullery. I had the pleasure of seeing him begin to wash up, and then,
finding no good in keeping down there, and the brick floor being cold
on my feet, I returned upstairs and sat in his chair by the fire. It
was burning low, and scarcely thinking, I put on a little coal. The
noise of this brought him up at once, and he stood aglare. He peered
about the room and was within an ace of touching me. Even after that
examination, he scarcely seemed satisfied. He stopped in the doorway
and took a final inspection before he went down.

“I waited in the little parlour for an age, and at last he came up and
opened the upstairs door. I just managed to get by him.

“On the staircase he stopped suddenly, so that I very nearly blundered
into him. He stood looking back right into my face and listening. ‘I
could have sworn,’ he said. His long hairy hand pulled at his lower
lip. His eye went up and down the staircase. Then he grunted and went
on up again.

“His hand was on the handle of a door, and then he stopped again with
the same puzzled anger on his face. He was becoming aware of the faint
sounds of my movements about him. The man must have had diabolically
acute hearing. He suddenly flashed into rage. ‘If there’s anyone in
this house—’ he cried with an oath, and left the threat unfinished. He
put his hand in his pocket, failed to find what he wanted, and rushing
past me went blundering noisily and pugnaciously downstairs. But I did
not follow him. I sat on the head of the staircase until his return.

“Presently he came up again, still muttering. He opened the door of the
room, and before I could enter, slammed it in my face.

“I resolved to explore the house, and spent some time in doing so as
noiselessly as possible. The house was very old and tumble-down, damp
so that the paper in the attics was peeling from the walls, and rat
infested. Some of the door handles were stiff and I was afraid to turn
them. Several rooms I did inspect were unfurnished, and others were
littered with theatrical lumber, bought second-hand, I judged, from its
appearance. In one room next to his I found a lot of old clothes. I
began routing among these, and in my eagerness forgot again the evident
sharpness of his ears. I heard a stealthy footstep and, looking up just
in time, saw him peering in at the tumbled heap and holding an
old-fashioned revolver in his hand. I stood perfectly still while he
stared about open-mouthed and suspicious. ‘It must have been her,’ he
said slowly. ‘Damn her!’

“He shut the door quietly, and immediately I heard the key turn in the
lock. Then his footsteps retreated. I realised abruptly that I was
locked in. For a minute I did not know what to do. I walked from door
to window and back, and stood perplexed. A gust of anger came upon me.
But I decided to inspect the clothes before I did anything further, and
my first attempt brought down a pile from an upper shelf. This brought
him back, more sinister than ever. That time he actually touched me,
jumped back with amazement and stood astonished in the middle of the
room.

“Presently he calmed a little. ‘Rats,’ he said in an undertone, fingers
on lips. He was evidently a little scared. I edged quietly out of the
room, but a plank creaked. Then the infernal little brute started going
all over the house, revolver in hand and locking door after door and
pocketing the keys. When I realised what he was up to I had a fit of
rage—I could hardly control myself sufficiently to watch my
opportunity. By this time I knew he was alone in the house, and so I
made no more ado, but knocked him on the head.”

“Knocked him on the head?” exclaimed Kemp.

“Yes—stunned him—as he was going downstairs. Hit him from behind with a
stool that stood on the landing. He went downstairs like a bag of old
boots.”

“But—I say! The common conventions of humanity—”

“Are all very well for common people. But the point was, Kemp, that I
had to get out of that house in a disguise without his seeing me. I
couldn’t think of any other way of doing it. And then I gagged him with
a Louis Quatorze vest and tied him up in a sheet.”

“Tied him up in a sheet!”

“Made a sort of bag of it. It was rather a good idea to keep the idiot
scared and quiet, and a devilish hard thing to get out of—head away
from the string. My dear Kemp, it’s no good your sitting glaring as
though I was a murderer. It had to be done. He had his revolver. If
once he saw me he would be able to describe me—”

“But still,” said Kemp, “in England—to-day. And the man was in his own
house, and you were—well, robbing.”

“Robbing! Confound it! You’ll call me a thief next! Surely, Kemp,
you’re not fool enough to dance on the old strings. Can’t you see my
position?”

“And his too,” said Kemp.

The Invisible Man stood up sharply. “What do you mean to say?”

Kemp’s face grew a trifle hard. He was about to speak and checked
himself. “I suppose, after all,” he said with a sudden change of
manner, “the thing had to be done. You were in a fix. But still—”

“Of course I was in a fix—an infernal fix. And he made me wild
too—hunting me about the house, fooling about with his revolver,
locking and unlocking doors. He was simply exasperating. You don’t
blame me, do you? You don’t blame me?”

“I never blame anyone,” said Kemp. “It’s quite out of fashion. What did
you do next?”

“I was hungry. Downstairs I found a loaf and some rank cheese—more than
sufficient to satisfy my hunger. I took some brandy and water, and then
went up past my impromptu bag—he was lying quite still—to the room
containing the old clothes. This looked out upon the street, two lace
curtains brown with dirt guarding the window. I went and peered out
through their interstices. Outside the day was bright—by contrast with
the brown shadows of the dismal house in which I found myself,
dazzlingly bright. A brisk traffic was going by, fruit carts, a hansom,
a four-wheeler with a pile of boxes, a fishmonger’s cart. I turned with
spots of colour swimming before my eyes to the shadowy fixtures behind
me. My excitement was giving place to a clear apprehension of my
position again. The room was full of a faint scent of benzoline, used,
I suppose, in cleaning the garments.

“I began a systematic search of the place. I should judge the hunchback
had been alone in the house for some time. He was a curious person.
Everything that could possibly be of service to me I collected in the
clothes storeroom, and then I made a deliberate selection. I found a
handbag I thought a suitable possession, and some powder, rouge, and
sticking-plaster.

“I had thought of painting and powdering my face and all that there was
to show of me, in order to render myself visible, but the disadvantage
of this lay in the fact that I should require turpentine and other
appliances and a considerable amount of time before I could vanish
again. Finally I chose a mask of the better type, slightly grotesque
but not more so than many human beings, dark glasses, greyish whiskers,
and a wig. I could find no underclothing, but that I could buy
subsequently, and for the time I swathed myself in calico dominoes and
some white cashmere scarfs. I could find no socks, but the hunchback’s
boots were rather a loose fit and sufficed. In a desk in the shop were
three sovereigns and about thirty shillings’ worth of silver, and in a
locked cupboard I burst in the inner room were eight pounds in gold. I
could go forth into the world again, equipped.

“Then came a curious hesitation. Was my appearance really credible? I
tried myself with a little bedroom looking-glass, inspecting myself
from every point of view to discover any forgotten chink, but it all
seemed sound. I was grotesque to the theatrical pitch, a stage miser,
but I was certainly not a physical impossibility. Gathering confidence,
I took my looking-glass down into the shop, pulled down the shop
blinds, and surveyed myself from every point of view with the help of
the cheval glass in the corner.

“I spent some minutes screwing up my courage and then unlocked the shop
door and marched out into the street, leaving the little man to get out
of his sheet again when he liked. In five minutes a dozen turnings
intervened between me and the costumier’s shop. No one appeared to
notice me very pointedly. My last difficulty seemed overcome.”

He stopped again.

“And you troubled no more about the hunchback?” said Kemp.

“No,” said the Invisible Man. “Nor have I heard what became of him. I
suppose he untied himself or kicked himself out. The knots were pretty
tight.”

He became silent and went to the window and stared out.

“What happened when you went out into the Strand?”

“Oh!—disillusionment again. I thought my troubles were over.
Practically I thought I had impunity to do whatever I chose,
everything—save to give away my secret. So I thought. Whatever I did,
whatever the consequences might be, was nothing to me. I had merely to
fling aside my garments and vanish. No person could hold me. I could
take my money where I found it. I decided to treat myself to a
sumptuous feast, and then put up at a good hotel, and accumulate a new
outfit of property. I felt amazingly confident; it’s not particularly
pleasant recalling that I was an ass. I went into a place and was
already ordering lunch, when it occurred to me that I could not eat
unless I exposed my invisible face. I finished ordering the lunch, told
the man I should be back in ten minutes, and went out exasperated. I
don’t know if you have ever been disappointed in your appetite.”

“Not quite so badly,” said Kemp, “but I can imagine it.”

“I could have smashed the silly devils. At last, faint with the desire
for tasteful food, I went into another place and demanded a private
room. ‘I am disfigured,’ I said. ‘Badly.’ They looked at me curiously,
but of course it was not their affair—and so at last I got my lunch. It
was not particularly well served, but it sufficed; and when I had had
it, I sat over a cigar, trying to plan my line of action. And outside a
snowstorm was beginning.

“The more I thought it over, Kemp, the more I realised what a helpless
absurdity an Invisible Man was—in a cold and dirty climate and a
crowded civilised city. Before I made this mad experiment I had dreamt
of a thousand advantages. That afternoon it seemed all disappointment.
I went over the heads of the things a man reckons desirable. No doubt
invisibility made it possible to get them, but it made it impossible to
enjoy them when they are got. Ambition—what is the good of pride of
place when you cannot appear there? What is the good of the love of
woman when her name must needs be Delilah? I have no taste for
politics, for the blackguardisms of fame, for philanthropy, for sport.
What was I to do? And for this I had become a wrapped-up mystery, a
swathed and bandaged caricature of a man!”

He paused, and his attitude suggested a roving glance at the window.

“But how did you get to Iping?” said Kemp, anxious to keep his guest
busy talking.

“I went there to work. I had one hope. It was a half idea! I have it
still. It is a full blown idea now. A way of getting back! Of restoring
what I have done. When I choose. When I have done all I mean to do
invisibly. And that is what I chiefly want to talk to you about now.”

“You went straight to Iping?”

“Yes. I had simply to get my three volumes of memoranda and my
cheque-book, my luggage and underclothing, order a quantity of
chemicals to work out this idea of mine—I will show you the
calculations as soon as I get my books—and then I started. Jove! I
remember the snowstorm now, and the accursed bother it was to keep the
snow from damping my pasteboard nose.”

“At the end,” said Kemp, “the day before yesterday, when they found you
out, you rather—to judge by the papers—”

“I did. Rather. Did I kill that fool of a constable?”

“No,” said Kemp. “He’s expected to recover.”

“That’s his luck, then. I clean lost my temper, the fools! Why couldn’t
they leave me alone? And that grocer lout?”

“There are no deaths expected,” said Kemp.

“I don’t know about that tramp of mine,” said the Invisible Man, with
an unpleasant laugh.

“By Heaven, Kemp, you don’t know what rage _is_! ... To have worked for
years, to have planned and plotted, and then to get some fumbling
purblind idiot messing across your course! ... Every conceivable sort
of silly creature that has ever been created has been sent to cross me.

“If I have much more of it, I shall go wild—I shall start mowing ’em.

“As it is, they’ve made things a thousand times more difficult.”

“No doubt it’s exasperating,” said Kemp, drily.




CHAPTER XXIV.
THE PLAN THAT FAILED


“But now,” said Kemp, with a side glance out of the window, “what are
we to do?”

He moved nearer his guest as he spoke in such a manner as to prevent
the possibility of a sudden glimpse of the three men who were advancing
up the hill road—with an intolerable slowness, as it seemed to Kemp.

“What were you planning to do when you were heading for Port Burdock?
_Had_ you any plan?”

“I was going to clear out of the country. But I have altered that plan
rather since seeing you. I thought it would be wise, now the weather is
hot and invisibility possible, to make for the South. Especially as my
secret was known, and everyone would be on the lookout for a masked and
muffled man. You have a line of steamers from here to France. My idea
was to get aboard one and run the risks of the passage. Thence I could
go by train into Spain, or else get to Algiers. It would not be
difficult. There a man might always be invisible—and yet live. And do
things. I was using that tramp as a money box and luggage carrier,
until I decided how to get my books and things sent over to meet me.”

“That’s clear.”

“And then the filthy brute must needs try and rob me! He _has_ hidden
my books, Kemp. Hidden my books! If I can lay my hands on him!”

“Best plan to get the books out of him first.”

“But where is he? Do you know?”

“He’s in the town police station, locked up, by his own request, in the
strongest cell in the place.”

“Cur!” said the Invisible Man.

“But that hangs up your plans a little.”

“We must get those books; those books are vital.”

“Certainly,” said Kemp, a little nervously, wondering if he heard
footsteps outside. “Certainly we must get those books. But that won’t
be difficult, if he doesn’t know they’re for you.”

“No,” said the Invisible Man, and thought.

Kemp tried to think of something to keep the talk going, but the
Invisible Man resumed of his own accord.

“Blundering into your house, Kemp,” he said, “changes all my plans. For
you are a man that can understand. In spite of all that has happened,
in spite of this publicity, of the loss of my books, of what I have
suffered, there still remain great possibilities, huge possibilities—”

“You have told no one I am here?” he asked abruptly.

Kemp hesitated. “That was implied,” he said.

“No one?” insisted Griffin.

“Not a soul.”

“Ah! Now—” The Invisible Man stood up, and sticking his arms akimbo
began to pace the study.

“I made a mistake, Kemp, a huge mistake, in carrying this thing through
alone. I have wasted strength, time, opportunities. Alone—it is
wonderful how little a man can do alone! To rob a little, to hurt a
little, and there is the end.

“What I want, Kemp, is a goal-keeper, a helper, and a hiding-place, an
arrangement whereby I can sleep and eat and rest in peace, and
unsuspected. I must have a confederate. With a confederate, with food
and rest—a thousand things are possible.

“Hitherto I have gone on vague lines. We have to consider all that
invisibility means, all that it does not mean. It means little
advantage for eavesdropping and so forth—one makes sounds. It’s of
little help—a little help perhaps—in housebreaking and so forth. Once
you’ve caught me you could easily imprison me. But on the other hand I
am hard to catch. This invisibility, in fact, is only good in two
cases: It’s useful in getting away, it’s useful in approaching. It’s
particularly useful, therefore, in killing. I can walk round a man,
whatever weapon he has, choose my point, strike as I like. Dodge as I
like. Escape as I like.”

Kemp’s hand went to his moustache. Was that a movement downstairs?

“And it is killing we must do, Kemp.”

“It is killing we must do,” repeated Kemp. “I’m listening to your plan,
Griffin, but I’m not agreeing, mind. _Why_ killing?”

“Not wanton killing, but a judicious slaying. The point is, they know
there is an Invisible Man—as well as we know there is an Invisible Man.
And that Invisible Man, Kemp, must now establish a Reign of Terror.
Yes; no doubt it’s startling. But I mean it. A Reign of Terror. He must
take some town like your Burdock and terrify and dominate it. He must
issue his orders. He can do that in a thousand ways—scraps of paper
thrust under doors would suffice. And all who disobey his orders he
must kill, and kill all who would defend them.”

“Humph!” said Kemp, no longer listening to Griffin but to the sound of
his front door opening and closing.

“It seems to me, Griffin,” he said, to cover his wandering attention,
“that your confederate would be in a difficult position.”

“No one would know he was a confederate,” said the Invisible Man,
eagerly. And then suddenly, “Hush! What’s that downstairs?”

“Nothing,” said Kemp, and suddenly began to speak loud and fast. “I
don’t agree to this, Griffin,” he said. “Understand me, I don’t agree
to this. Why dream of playing a game against the race? How can you hope
to gain happiness? Don’t be a lone wolf. Publish your results; take the
world—take the nation at least—into your confidence. Think what you
might do with a million helpers—”

The Invisible Man interrupted—arm extended. “There are footsteps coming
upstairs,” he said in a low voice.

“Nonsense,” said Kemp.

“Let me see,” said the Invisible Man, and advanced, arm extended, to
the door.

And then things happened very swiftly. Kemp hesitated for a second and
then moved to intercept him. The Invisible Man started and stood still.
“Traitor!” cried the Voice, and suddenly the dressing-gown opened, and
sitting down the Unseen began to disrobe. Kemp made three swift steps
to the door, and forthwith the Invisible Man—his legs had
vanished—sprang to his feet with a shout. Kemp flung the door open.

As it opened, there came a sound of hurrying feet downstairs and
voices.

With a quick movement Kemp thrust the Invisible Man back, sprang aside,
and slammed the door. The key was outside and ready. In another moment
Griffin would have been alone in the belvedere study, a prisoner. Save
for one little thing. The key had been slipped in hastily that morning.
As Kemp slammed the door it fell noisily upon the carpet.

Kemp’s face became white. He tried to grip the door handle with both
hands. For a moment he stood lugging. Then the door gave six inches.
But he got it closed again. The second time it was jerked a foot wide,
and the dressing-gown came wedging itself into the opening. His throat
was gripped by invisible fingers, and he left his hold on the handle to
defend himself. He was forced back, tripped and pitched heavily into
the corner of the landing. The empty dressing-gown was flung on the top
of him.

Halfway up the staircase was Colonel Adye, the recipient of Kemp’s
letter, the chief of the Burdock police. He was staring aghast at the
sudden appearance of Kemp, followed by the extraordinary sight of
clothing tossing empty in the air. He saw Kemp felled, and struggling
to his feet. He saw him rush forward, and go down again, felled like an
ox.

Then suddenly he was struck violently. By nothing! A vast weight, it
seemed, leapt upon him, and he was hurled headlong down the staircase,
with a grip on his throat and a knee in his groin. An invisible foot
trod on his back, a ghostly patter passed downstairs, he heard the two
police officers in the hall shout and run, and the front door of the
house slammed violently.

He rolled over and sat up staring. He saw, staggering down the
staircase, Kemp, dusty and disheveled, one side of his face white from
a blow, his lip bleeding, and a pink dressing-gown and some
underclothing held in his arms.

“My God!” cried Kemp, “the game’s up! He’s gone!”




CHAPTER XXV.
THE HUNTING OF THE INVISIBLE MAN


For a space Kemp was too inarticulate to make Adye understand the swift
things that had just happened. They stood on the landing, Kemp speaking
swiftly, the grotesque swathings of Griffin still on his arm. But
presently Adye began to grasp something of the situation.

“He is mad,” said Kemp; “inhuman. He is pure selfishness. He thinks of
nothing but his own advantage, his own safety. I have listened to such
a story this morning of brutal self-seeking.... He has wounded men. He
will kill them unless we can prevent him. He will create a panic.
Nothing can stop him. He is going out now—furious!”

“He must be caught,” said Adye. “That is certain.”

“But how?” cried Kemp, and suddenly became full of ideas. “You must
begin at once. You must set every available man to work; you must
prevent his leaving this district. Once he gets away, he may go through
the countryside as he wills, killing and maiming. He dreams of a reign
of terror! A reign of terror, I tell you. You must set a watch on
trains and roads and shipping. The garrison must help. You must wire
for help. The only thing that may keep him here is the thought of
recovering some books of notes he counts of value. I will tell you of
that! There is a man in your police station—Marvel.”

“I know,” said Adye, “I know. Those books—yes. But the tramp....”

“Says he hasn’t them. But he thinks the tramp has. And you must prevent
him from eating or sleeping; day and night the country must be astir
for him. Food must be locked up and secured, all food, so that he will
have to break his way to it. The houses everywhere must be barred
against him. Heaven send us cold nights and rain! The whole
country-side must begin hunting and keep hunting. I tell you, Adye, he
is a danger, a disaster; unless he is pinned and secured, it is
frightful to think of the things that may happen.”

“What else can we do?” said Adye. “I must go down at once and begin
organising. But why not come? Yes—you come too! Come, and we must hold
a sort of council of war—get Hopps to help—and the railway managers. By
Jove! it’s urgent. Come along—tell me as we go. What else is there we
can do? Put that stuff down.”

In another moment Adye was leading the way downstairs. They found the
front door open and the policemen standing outside staring at empty
air. “He’s got away, sir,” said one.

“We must go to the central station at once,” said Adye. “One of you go
on down and get a cab to come up and meet us—quickly. And now, Kemp,
what else?”

“Dogs,” said Kemp. “Get dogs. They don’t see him, but they wind him.
Get dogs.”

“Good,” said Adye. “It’s not generally known, but the prison officials
over at Halstead know a man with bloodhounds. Dogs. What else?”

“Bear in mind,” said Kemp, “his food shows. After eating, his food
shows until it is assimilated. So that he has to hide after eating. You
must keep on beating. Every thicket, every quiet corner. And put all
weapons—all implements that might be weapons, away. He can’t carry such
things for long. And what he can snatch up and strike men with must be
hidden away.”

“Good again,” said Adye. “We shall have him yet!”

“And on the roads,” said Kemp, and hesitated.

“Yes?” said Adye.

“Powdered glass,” said Kemp. “It’s cruel, I know. But think of what he
may do!”

Adye drew the air in sharply between his teeth. “It’s unsportsmanlike.
I don’t know. But I’ll have powdered glass got ready. If he goes too
far....”

“The man’s become inhuman, I tell you,” said Kemp. “I am as sure he
will establish a reign of terror—so soon as he has got over the
emotions of this escape—as I am sure I am talking to you. Our only
chance is to be ahead. He has cut himself off from his kind. His blood
be upon his own head.”




CHAPTER XXVI.
THE WICKSTEED MURDER


The Invisible Man seems to have rushed out of Kemp’s house in a state
of blind fury. A little child playing near Kemp’s gateway was violently
caught up and thrown aside, so that its ankle was broken, and
thereafter for some hours the Invisible Man passed out of human
perceptions. No one knows where he went nor what he did. But one can
imagine him hurrying through the hot June forenoon, up the hill and on
to the open downland behind Port Burdock, raging and despairing at his
intolerable fate, and sheltering at last, heated and weary, amid the
thickets of Hintondean, to piece together again his shattered schemes
against his species. That seems the most probable refuge for him, for
there it was he re-asserted himself in a grimly tragical manner about
two in the afternoon.

One wonders what his state of mind may have been during that time, and
what plans he devised. No doubt he was almost ecstatically exasperated
by Kemp’s treachery, and though we may be able to understand the
motives that led to that deceit, we may still imagine and even
sympathise a little with the fury the attempted surprise must have
occasioned. Perhaps something of the stunned astonishment of his Oxford
Street experiences may have returned to him, for he had evidently
counted on Kemp’s co-operation in his brutal dream of a terrorised
world. At any rate he vanished from human ken about midday, and no
living witness can tell what he did until about half-past two. It was a
fortunate thing, perhaps, for humanity, but for him it was a fatal
inaction.

During that time a growing multitude of men scattered over the
countryside were busy. In the morning he had still been simply a
legend, a terror; in the afternoon, by virtue chiefly of Kemp’s drily
worded proclamation, he was presented as a tangible antagonist, to be
wounded, captured, or overcome, and the countryside began organising
itself with inconceivable rapidity. By two o’clock even he might still
have removed himself out of the district by getting aboard a train, but
after two that became impossible. Every passenger train along the lines
on a great parallelogram between Southampton, Manchester, Brighton and
Horsham, travelled with locked doors, and the goods traffic was almost
entirely suspended. And in a great circle of twenty miles round Port
Burdock, men armed with guns and bludgeons were presently setting out
in groups of three and four, with dogs, to beat the roads and fields.

Mounted policemen rode along the country lanes, stopping at every
cottage and warning the people to lock up their houses, and keep
indoors unless they were armed, and all the elementary schools had
broken up by three o’clock, and the children, scared and keeping
together in groups, were hurrying home. Kemp’s proclamation—signed
indeed by Adye—was posted over almost the whole district by four or
five o’clock in the afternoon. It gave briefly but clearly all the
conditions of the struggle, the necessity of keeping the Invisible Man
from food and sleep, the necessity for incessant watchfulness and for a
prompt attention to any evidence of his movements. And so swift and
decided was the action of the authorities, so prompt and universal was
the belief in this strange being, that before nightfall an area of
several hundred square miles was in a stringent state of siege. And
before nightfall, too, a thrill of horror went through the whole
watching nervous countryside. Going from whispering mouth to mouth,
swift and certain over the length and breadth of the country, passed
the story of the murder of Mr. Wicksteed.

If our supposition that the Invisible Man’s refuge was the Hintondean
thickets, then we must suppose that in the early afternoon he sallied
out again bent upon some project that involved the use of a weapon. We
cannot know what the project was, but the evidence that he had the iron
rod in hand before he met Wicksteed is to me at least overwhelming.

Of course we can know nothing of the details of that encounter. It
occurred on the edge of a gravel pit, not two hundred yards from Lord
Burdock’s lodge gate. Everything points to a desperate struggle—the
trampled ground, the numerous wounds Mr. Wicksteed received, his
splintered walking-stick; but why the attack was made, save in a
murderous frenzy, it is impossible to imagine. Indeed the theory of
madness is almost unavoidable. Mr. Wicksteed was a man of forty-five or
forty-six, steward to Lord Burdock, of inoffensive habits and
appearance, the very last person in the world to provoke such a
terrible antagonist. Against him it would seem the Invisible Man used
an iron rod dragged from a broken piece of fence. He stopped this quiet
man, going quietly home to his midday meal, attacked him, beat down his
feeble defences, broke his arm, felled him, and smashed his head to a
jelly.

Of course, he must have dragged this rod out of the fencing before he
met his victim—he must have been carrying it ready in his hand. Only
two details beyond what has already been stated seem to bear on the
matter. One is the circumstance that the gravel pit was not in Mr.
Wicksteed’s direct path home, but nearly a couple of hundred yards out
of his way. The other is the assertion of a little girl to the effect
that, going to her afternoon school, she saw the murdered man
“trotting” in a peculiar manner across a field towards the gravel pit.
Her pantomime of his action suggests a man pursuing something on the
ground before him and striking at it ever and again with his
walking-stick. She was the last person to see him alive. He passed out
of her sight to his death, the struggle being hidden from her only by a
clump of beech trees and a slight depression in the ground.

Now this, to the present writer’s mind at least, lifts the murder out
of the realm of the absolutely wanton. We may imagine that Griffin had
taken the rod as a weapon indeed, but without any deliberate intention
of using it in murder. Wicksteed may then have come by and noticed this
rod inexplicably moving through the air. Without any thought of the
Invisible Man—for Port Burdock is ten miles away—he may have pursued
it. It is quite conceivable that he may not even have heard of the
Invisible Man. One can then imagine the Invisible Man making
off—quietly in order to avoid discovering his presence in the
neighbourhood, and Wicksteed, excited and curious, pursuing this
unaccountably locomotive object—finally striking at it.

No doubt the Invisible Man could easily have distanced his middle-aged
pursuer under ordinary circumstances, but the position in which
Wicksteed’s body was found suggests that he had the ill luck to drive
his quarry into a corner between a drift of stinging nettles and the
gravel pit. To those who appreciate the extraordinary irascibility of
the Invisible Man, the rest of the encounter will be easy to imagine.

But this is pure hypothesis. The only undeniable facts—for stories of
children are often unreliable—are the discovery of Wicksteed’s body,
done to death, and of the blood-stained iron rod flung among the
nettles. The abandonment of the rod by Griffin, suggests that in the
emotional excitement of the affair, the purpose for which he took it—if
he had a purpose—was abandoned. He was certainly an intensely
egotistical and unfeeling man, but the sight of his victim, his first
victim, bloody and pitiful at his feet, may have released some long
pent fountain of remorse which for a time may have flooded whatever
scheme of action he had contrived.

After the murder of Mr. Wicksteed, he would seem to have struck across
the country towards the downland. There is a story of a voice heard
about sunset by a couple of men in a field near Fern Bottom. It was
wailing and laughing, sobbing and groaning, and ever and again it
shouted. It must have been queer hearing. It drove up across the middle
of a clover field and died away towards the hills.

That afternoon the Invisible Man must have learnt something of the
rapid use Kemp had made of his confidences. He must have found houses
locked and secured; he may have loitered about railway stations and
prowled about inns, and no doubt he read the proclamations and realised
something of the nature of the campaign against him. And as the evening
advanced, the fields became dotted here and there with groups of three
or four men, and noisy with the yelping of dogs. These men-hunters had
particular instructions in the case of an encounter as to the way they
should support one another. But he avoided them all. We may understand
something of his exasperation, and it could have been none the less
because he himself had supplied the information that was being used so
remorselessly against him. For that day at least he lost heart; for
nearly twenty-four hours, save when he turned on Wicksteed, he was a
hunted man. In the night, he must have eaten and slept; for in the
morning he was himself again, active, powerful, angry, and malignant,
prepared for his last great struggle against the world.




CHAPTER XXVII.
THE SIEGE OF KEMP’S HOUSE


Kemp read a strange missive, written in pencil on a greasy sheet of
paper.

“You have been amazingly energetic and clever,” this letter ran,
“though what you stand to gain by it I cannot imagine. You are against
me. For a whole day you have chased me; you have tried to rob me of a
night’s rest. But I have had food in spite of you, I have slept in
spite of you, and the game is only beginning. The game is only
beginning. There is nothing for it, but to start the Terror. This
announces the first day of the Terror. Port Burdock is no longer under
the Queen, tell your Colonel of Police, and the rest of them; it is
under me—the Terror! This is day one of year one of the new epoch—the
Epoch of the Invisible Man. I am Invisible Man the First. To begin with
the rule will be easy. The first day there will be one execution for
the sake of example—a man named Kemp. Death starts for him to-day. He
may lock himself away, hide himself away, get guards about him, put on
armour if he likes—Death, the unseen Death, is coming. Let him take
precautions; it will impress my people. Death starts from the pillar
box by midday. The letter will fall in as the postman comes along, then
off! The game begins. Death starts. Help him not, my people, lest Death
fall upon you also. To-day Kemp is to die.”

Kemp read this letter twice, “It’s no hoax,” he said. “That’s his
voice! And he means it.”

He turned the folded sheet over and saw on the addressed side of it the
postmark Hintondean, and the prosaic detail “2d. to pay.”

He got up slowly, leaving his lunch unfinished—the letter had come by
the one o’clock post—and went into his study. He rang for his
housekeeper, and told her to go round the house at once, examine all
the fastenings of the windows, and close all the shutters. He closed
the shutters of his study himself. From a locked drawer in his bedroom
he took a little revolver, examined it carefully, and put it into the
pocket of his lounge jacket. He wrote a number of brief notes, one to
Colonel Adye, gave them to his servant to take, with explicit
instructions as to her way of leaving the house. “There is no danger,”
he said, and added a mental reservation, “to you.” He remained
meditative for a space after doing this, and then returned to his
cooling lunch.

He ate with gaps of thought. Finally he struck the table sharply. “We
will have him!” he said; “and I am the bait. He will come too far.”

He went up to the belvedere, carefully shutting every door after him.
“It’s a game,” he said, “an odd game—but the chances are all for me,
Mr. Griffin, in spite of your invisibility. Griffin _contra mundum_ ...
with a vengeance.”

He stood at the window staring at the hot hillside. “He must get food
every day—and I don’t envy him. Did he really sleep last night? Out in
the open somewhere—secure from collisions. I wish we could get some
good cold wet weather instead of the heat.

“He may be watching me now.”

He went close to the window. Something rapped smartly against the
brickwork over the frame, and made him start violently back.

“I’m getting nervous,” said Kemp. But it was five minutes before he
went to the window again. “It must have been a sparrow,” he said.

Presently he heard the front-door bell ringing, and hurried downstairs.
He unbolted and unlocked the door, examined the chain, put it up, and
opened cautiously without showing himself. A familiar voice hailed him.
It was Adye.

“Your servant’s been assaulted, Kemp,” he said round the door.

“What!” exclaimed Kemp.

“Had that note of yours taken away from her. He’s close about here. Let
me in.”

Kemp released the chain, and Adye entered through as narrow an opening
as possible. He stood in the hall, looking with infinite relief at Kemp
refastening the door. “Note was snatched out of her hand. Scared her
horribly. She’s down at the station. Hysterics. He’s close here. What
was it about?”

Kemp swore.

“What a fool I was,” said Kemp. “I might have known. It’s not an hour’s
walk from Hintondean. Already?”

“What’s up?” said Adye.

“Look here!” said Kemp, and led the way into his study. He handed Adye
the Invisible Man’s letter. Adye read it and whistled softly. “And
you—?” said Adye.

“Proposed a trap—like a fool,” said Kemp, “and sent my proposal out by
a maid servant. To him.”

Adye followed Kemp’s profanity.

“He’ll clear out,” said Adye.

“Not he,” said Kemp.

A resounding smash of glass came from upstairs. Adye had a silvery
glimpse of a little revolver half out of Kemp’s pocket. “It’s a window,
upstairs!” said Kemp, and led the way up. There came a second smash
while they were still on the staircase. When they reached the study
they found two of the three windows smashed, half the room littered
with splintered glass, and one big flint lying on the writing table.
The two men stopped in the doorway, contemplating the wreckage. Kemp
swore again, and as he did so the third window went with a snap like a
pistol, hung starred for a moment, and collapsed in jagged, shivering
triangles into the room.

“What’s this for?” said Adye.

“It’s a beginning,” said Kemp.

“There’s no way of climbing up here?”

“Not for a cat,” said Kemp.

“No shutters?”

“Not here. All the downstairs rooms—Hullo!”

Smash, and then whack of boards hit hard came from downstairs.
“Confound him!” said Kemp. “That must be—yes—it’s one of the bedrooms.
He’s going to do all the house. But he’s a fool. The shutters are up,
and the glass will fall outside. He’ll cut his feet.”

Another window proclaimed its destruction. The two men stood on the
landing perplexed. “I have it!” said Adye. “Let me have a stick or
something, and I’ll go down to the station and get the bloodhounds put
on. That ought to settle him! They’re hard by—not ten minutes—”

Another window went the way of its fellows.

“You haven’t a revolver?” asked Adye.

Kemp’s hand went to his pocket. Then he hesitated. “I haven’t one—at
least to spare.”

“I’ll bring it back,” said Adye, “you’ll be safe here.”

Kemp, ashamed of his momentary lapse from truthfulness, handed him the
weapon.

“Now for the door,” said Adye.

As they stood hesitating in the hall, they heard one of the first-floor
bedroom windows crack and clash. Kemp went to the door and began to
slip the bolts as silently as possible. His face was a little paler
than usual. “You must step straight out,” said Kemp. In another moment
Adye was on the doorstep and the bolts were dropping back into the
staples. He hesitated for a moment, feeling more comfortable with his
back against the door. Then he marched, upright and square, down the
steps. He crossed the lawn and approached the gate. A little breeze
seemed to ripple over the grass. Something moved near him. “Stop a
bit,” said a Voice, and Adye stopped dead and his hand tightened on the
revolver.

“Well?” said Adye, white and grim, and every nerve tense.

“Oblige me by going back to the house,” said the Voice, as tense and
grim as Adye’s.

“Sorry,” said Adye a little hoarsely, and moistened his lips with his
tongue. The Voice was on his left front, he thought. Suppose he were to
take his luck with a shot?

“What are you going for?” said the Voice, and there was a quick
movement of the two, and a flash of sunlight from the open lip of
Adye’s pocket.

Adye desisted and thought. “Where I go,” he said slowly, “is my own
business.” The words were still on his lips, when an arm came round his
neck, his back felt a knee, and he was sprawling backward. He drew
clumsily and fired absurdly, and in another moment he was struck in the
mouth and the revolver wrested from his grip. He made a vain clutch at
a slippery limb, tried to struggle up and fell back. “Damn!” said Adye.
The Voice laughed. “I’d kill you now if it wasn’t the waste of a
bullet,” it said. He saw the revolver in mid-air, six feet off,
covering him.

“Well?” said Adye, sitting up.

“Get up,” said the Voice.

Adye stood up.

“Attention,” said the Voice, and then fiercely, “Don’t try any games.
Remember I can see your face if you can’t see mine. You’ve got to go
back to the house.”

“He won’t let me in,” said Adye.

“That’s a pity,” said the Invisible Man. “I’ve got no quarrel with
you.”

Adye moistened his lips again. He glanced away from the barrel of the
revolver and saw the sea far off very blue and dark under the midday
sun, the smooth green down, the white cliff of the Head, and the
multitudinous town, and suddenly he knew that life was very sweet. His
eyes came back to this little metal thing hanging between heaven and
earth, six yards away. “What am I to do?” he said sullenly.

“What am _I_ to do?” asked the Invisible Man. “You will get help. The
only thing is for you to go back.”

“I will try. If he lets me in will you promise not to rush the door?”

“I’ve got no quarrel with you,” said the Voice.

Kemp had hurried upstairs after letting Adye out, and now crouching
among the broken glass and peering cautiously over the edge of the
study window sill, he saw Adye stand parleying with the Unseen. “Why
doesn’t he fire?” whispered Kemp to himself. Then the revolver moved a
little and the glint of the sunlight flashed in Kemp’s eyes. He shaded
his eyes and tried to see the source of the blinding beam.

“Surely!” he said, “Adye has given up the revolver.”

“Promise not to rush the door,” Adye was saying. “Don’t push a winning
game too far. Give a man a chance.”

“You go back to the house. I tell you flatly I will not promise
anything.”

Adye’s decision seemed suddenly made. He turned towards the house,
walking slowly with his hands behind him. Kemp watched him—puzzled. The
revolver vanished, flashed again into sight, vanished again, and became
evident on a closer scrutiny as a little dark object following Adye.
Then things happened very quickly. Adye leapt backwards, swung around,
clutched at this little object, missed it, threw up his hands and fell
forward on his face, leaving a little puff of blue in the air. Kemp did
not hear the sound of the shot. Adye writhed, raised himself on one
arm, fell forward, and lay still.

For a space Kemp remained staring at the quiet carelessness of Adye’s
attitude. The afternoon was very hot and still, nothing seemed stirring
in all the world save a couple of yellow butterflies chasing each other
through the shrubbery between the house and the road gate. Adye lay on
the lawn near the gate. The blinds of all the villas down the hill-road
were drawn, but in one little green summer-house was a white figure,
apparently an old man asleep. Kemp scrutinised the surroundings of the
house for a glimpse of the revolver, but it had vanished. His eyes came
back to Adye. The game was opening well.

Then came a ringing and knocking at the front door, that grew at last
tumultuous, but pursuant to Kemp’s instructions the servants had locked
themselves into their rooms. This was followed by a silence. Kemp sat
listening and then began peering cautiously out of the three windows,
one after another. He went to the staircase head and stood listening
uneasily. He armed himself with his bedroom poker, and went to examine
the interior fastenings of the ground-floor windows again. Everything
was safe and quiet. He returned to the belvedere. Adye lay motionless
over the edge of the gravel just as he had fallen. Coming along the
road by the villas were the housemaid and two policemen.

Everything was deadly still. The three people seemed very slow in
approaching. He wondered what his antagonist was doing.

He started. There was a smash from below. He hesitated and went
downstairs again. Suddenly the house resounded with heavy blows and the
splintering of wood. He heard a smash and the destructive clang of the
iron fastenings of the shutters. He turned the key and opened the
kitchen door. As he did so, the shutters, split and splintering, came
flying inward. He stood aghast. The window frame, save for one
crossbar, was still intact, but only little teeth of glass remained in
the frame. The shutters had been driven in with an axe, and now the axe
was descending in sweeping blows upon the window frame and the iron
bars defending it. Then suddenly it leapt aside and vanished. He saw
the revolver lying on the path outside, and then the little weapon
sprang into the air. He dodged back. The revolver cracked just too
late, and a splinter from the edge of the closing door flashed over his
head. He slammed and locked the door, and as he stood outside he heard
Griffin shouting and laughing. Then the blows of the axe with its
splitting and smashing consequences, were resumed.

Kemp stood in the passage trying to think. In a moment the Invisible
Man would be in the kitchen. This door would not keep him a moment, and
then—

A ringing came at the front door again. It would be the policemen. He
ran into the hall, put up the chain, and drew the bolts. He made the
girl speak before he dropped the chain, and the three people blundered
into the house in a heap, and Kemp slammed the door again.

“The Invisible Man!” said Kemp. “He has a revolver, with two
shots—left. He’s killed Adye. Shot him anyhow. Didn’t you see him on
the lawn? He’s lying there.”

“Who?” said one of the policemen.

“Adye,” said Kemp.

“We came in the back way,” said the girl.

“What’s that smashing?” asked one of the policemen.

“He’s in the kitchen—or will be. He has found an axe—”

Suddenly the house was full of the Invisible Man’s resounding blows on
the kitchen door. The girl stared towards the kitchen, shuddered, and
retreated into the dining-room. Kemp tried to explain in broken
sentences. They heard the kitchen door give.

“This way,” said Kemp, starting into activity, and bundled the
policemen into the dining-room doorway.

“Poker,” said Kemp, and rushed to the fender. He handed the poker he
had carried to the policeman and the dining-room one to the other. He
suddenly flung himself backward.

“Whup!” said one policeman, ducked, and caught the axe on his poker.
The pistol snapped its penultimate shot and ripped a valuable Sidney
Cooper. The second policeman brought his poker down on the little
weapon, as one might knock down a wasp, and sent it rattling to the
floor.

At the first clash the girl screamed, stood screaming for a moment by
the fireplace, and then ran to open the shutters—possibly with an idea
of escaping by the shattered window.

The axe receded into the passage, and fell to a position about two feet
from the ground. They could hear the Invisible Man breathing. “Stand
away, you two,” he said. “I want that man Kemp.”

“We want you,” said the first policeman, making a quick step forward
and wiping with his poker at the Voice. The Invisible Man must have
started back, and he blundered into the umbrella stand.

Then, as the policeman staggered with the swing of the blow he had
aimed, the Invisible Man countered with the axe, the helmet crumpled
like paper, and the blow sent the man spinning to the floor at the head
of the kitchen stairs. But the second policeman, aiming behind the axe
with his poker, hit something soft that snapped. There was a sharp
exclamation of pain and then the axe fell to the ground. The policeman
wiped again at vacancy and hit nothing; he put his foot on the axe, and
struck again. Then he stood, poker clubbed, listening intent for the
slightest movement.

He heard the dining-room window open, and a quick rush of feet within.
His companion rolled over and sat up, with the blood running down
between his eye and ear. “Where is he?” asked the man on the floor.

“Don’t know. I’ve hit him. He’s standing somewhere in the hall. Unless
he’s slipped past you. Doctor Kemp—sir.”

Pause.

“Doctor Kemp,” cried the policeman again.

The second policeman began struggling to his feet. He stood up.
Suddenly the faint pad of bare feet on the kitchen stairs could be
heard. “Yap!” cried the first policeman, and incontinently flung his
poker. It smashed a little gas bracket.

He made as if he would pursue the Invisible Man downstairs. Then he
thought better of it and stepped into the dining-room.

“Doctor Kemp—” he began, and stopped short.

“Doctor Kemp’s a hero,” he said, as his companion looked over his
shoulder.

The dining-room window was wide open, and neither housemaid nor Kemp
was to be seen.

The second policeman’s opinion of Kemp was terse and vivid.




CHAPTER XXVIII.
THE HUNTER HUNTED


Mr. Heelas, Mr. Kemp’s nearest neighbour among the villa holders, was
asleep in his summer house when the siege of Kemp’s house began. Mr.
Heelas was one of the sturdy minority who refused to believe “in all
this nonsense” about an Invisible Man. His wife, however, as he was
subsequently to be reminded, did. He insisted upon walking about his
garden just as if nothing was the matter, and he went to sleep in the
afternoon in accordance with the custom of years. He slept through the
smashing of the windows, and then woke up suddenly with a curious
persuasion of something wrong. He looked across at Kemp’s house, rubbed
his eyes and looked again. Then he put his feet to the ground, and sat
listening. He said he was damned, but still the strange thing was
visible. The house looked as though it had been deserted for
weeks—after a violent riot. Every window was broken, and every window,
save those of the belvedere study, was blinded by the internal
shutters.

“I could have sworn it was all right”—he looked at his watch—“twenty
minutes ago.”

He became aware of a measured concussion and the clash of glass, far
away in the distance. And then, as he sat open-mouthed, came a still
more wonderful thing. The shutters of the drawing-room window were
flung open violently, and the housemaid in her outdoor hat and
garments, appeared struggling in a frantic manner to throw up the sash.
Suddenly a man appeared beside her, helping her—Dr. Kemp! In another
moment the window was open, and the housemaid was struggling out; she
pitched forward and vanished among the shrubs. Mr. Heelas stood up,
exclaiming vaguely and vehemently at all these wonderful things. He saw
Kemp stand on the sill, spring from the window, and reappear almost
instantaneously running along a path in the shrubbery and stooping as
he ran, like a man who evades observation. He vanished behind a
laburnum, and appeared again clambering over a fence that abutted on
the open down. In a second he had tumbled over and was running at a
tremendous pace down the slope towards Mr. Heelas.

“Lord!” cried Mr. Heelas, struck with an idea; “it’s that Invisible Man
brute! It’s right, after all!”

With Mr. Heelas to think things like that was to act, and his cook
watching him from the top window was amazed to see him come pelting
towards the house at a good nine miles an hour. There was a slamming of
doors, a ringing of bells, and the voice of Mr. Heelas bellowing like a
bull. “Shut the doors, shut the windows, shut everything!—the Invisible
Man is coming!” Instantly the house was full of screams and directions,
and scurrying feet. He ran himself to shut the French windows that
opened on the veranda; as he did so Kemp’s head and shoulders and knee
appeared over the edge of the garden fence. In another moment Kemp had
ploughed through the asparagus, and was running across the tennis lawn
to the house.

“You can’t come in,” said Mr. Heelas, shutting the bolts. “I’m very
sorry if he’s after you, but you can’t come in!”

Kemp appeared with a face of terror close to the glass, rapping and
then shaking frantically at the French window. Then, seeing his efforts
were useless, he ran along the veranda, vaulted the end, and went to
hammer at the side door. Then he ran round by the side gate to the
front of the house, and so into the hill-road. And Mr. Heelas staring
from his window—a face of horror—had scarcely witnessed Kemp vanish,
ere the asparagus was being trampled this way and that by feet unseen.
At that Mr. Heelas fled precipitately upstairs, and the rest of the
chase is beyond his purview. But as he passed the staircase window, he
heard the side gate slam.

Emerging into the hill-road, Kemp naturally took the downward
direction, and so it was he came to run in his own person the very race
he had watched with such a critical eye from the belvedere study only
four days ago. He ran it well, for a man out of training, and though
his face was white and wet, his wits were cool to the last. He ran with
wide strides, and wherever a patch of rough ground intervened, wherever
there came a patch of raw flints, or a bit of broken glass shone
dazzling, he crossed it and left the bare invisible feet that followed
to take what line they would.

For the first time in his life Kemp discovered that the hill-road was
indescribably vast and desolate, and that the beginnings of the town
far below at the hill foot were strangely remote. Never had there been
a slower or more painful method of progression than running. All the
gaunt villas, sleeping in the afternoon sun, looked locked and barred;
no doubt they were locked and barred—by his own orders. But at any rate
they might have kept a lookout for an eventuality like this! The town
was rising up now, the sea had dropped out of sight behind it, and
people down below were stirring. A tram was just arriving at the hill
foot. Beyond that was the police station. Was that footsteps he heard
behind him? Spurt.

The people below were staring at him, one or two were running, and his
breath was beginning to saw in his throat. The tram was quite near now,
and the “Jolly Cricketers” was noisily barring its doors. Beyond the
tram were posts and heaps of gravel—the drainage works. He had a
transitory idea of jumping into the tram and slamming the doors, and
then he resolved to go for the police station. In another moment he had
passed the door of the “Jolly Cricketers,” and was in the blistering
fag end of the street, with human beings about him. The tram driver and
his helper—arrested by the sight of his furious haste—stood staring
with the tram horses unhitched. Further on the astonished features of
navvies appeared above the mounds of gravel.

His pace broke a little, and then he heard the swift pad of his
pursuer, and leapt forward again. “The Invisible Man!” he cried to the
navvies, with a vague indicative gesture, and by an inspiration leapt
the excavation and placed a burly group between him and the chase. Then
abandoning the idea of the police station he turned into a little side
street, rushed by a greengrocer’s cart, hesitated for the tenth of a
second at the door of a sweetstuff shop, and then made for the mouth of
an alley that ran back into the main Hill Street again. Two or three
little children were playing here, and shrieked and scattered at his
apparition, and forthwith doors and windows opened and excited mothers
revealed their hearts. Out he shot into Hill Street again, three
hundred yards from the tram-line end, and immediately he became aware
of a tumultuous vociferation and running people.

He glanced up the street towards the hill. Hardly a dozen yards off ran
a huge navvy, cursing in fragments and slashing viciously with a spade,
and hard behind him came the tram conductor with his fists clenched. Up
the street others followed these two, striking and shouting. Down
towards the town, men and women were running, and he noticed clearly
one man coming out of a shop-door with a stick in his hand. “Spread
out! Spread out!” cried some one. Kemp suddenly grasped the altered
condition of the chase. He stopped, and looked round, panting. “He’s
close here!” he cried. “Form a line across—”

He was hit hard under the ear, and went reeling, trying to face round
towards his unseen antagonist. He just managed to keep his feet, and he
struck a vain counter in the air. Then he was hit again under the jaw,
and sprawled headlong on the ground. In another moment a knee
compressed his diaphragm, and a couple of eager hands gripped his
throat, but the grip of one was weaker than the other; he grasped the
wrists, heard a cry of pain from his assailant, and then the spade of
the navvy came whirling through the air above him, and struck something
with a dull thud. He felt a drop of moisture on his face. The grip at
his throat suddenly relaxed, and with a convulsive effort, Kemp loosed
himself, grasped a limp shoulder, and rolled uppermost. He gripped the
unseen elbows near the ground. “I’ve got him!” screamed Kemp. “Help!
Help—hold! He’s down! Hold his feet!”

In another second there was a simultaneous rush upon the struggle, and
a stranger coming into the road suddenly might have thought an
exceptionally savage game of Rugby football was in progress. And there
was no shouting after Kemp’s cry—only a sound of blows and feet and
heavy breathing.

Then came a mighty effort, and the Invisible Man threw off a couple of
his antagonists and rose to his knees. Kemp clung to him in front like
a hound to a stag, and a dozen hands gripped, clutched, and tore at the
Unseen. The tram conductor suddenly got the neck and shoulders and
lugged him back.

Down went the heap of struggling men again and rolled over. There was,
I am afraid, some savage kicking. Then suddenly a wild scream of
“Mercy! Mercy!” that died down swiftly to a sound like choking.

“Get back, you fools!” cried the muffled voice of Kemp, and there was a
vigorous shoving back of stalwart forms. “He’s hurt, I tell you. Stand
back!”

There was a brief struggle to clear a space, and then the circle of
eager faces saw the doctor kneeling, as it seemed, fifteen inches in
the air, and holding invisible arms to the ground. Behind him a
constable gripped invisible ankles.

“Don’t you leave go of en,” cried the big navvy, holding a
blood-stained spade; “he’s shamming.”

“He’s not shamming,” said the doctor, cautiously raising his knee; “and
I’ll hold him.” His face was bruised and already going red; he spoke
thickly because of a bleeding lip. He released one hand and seemed to
be feeling at the face. “The mouth’s all wet,” he said. And then, “Good
God!”

He stood up abruptly and then knelt down on the ground by the side of
the thing unseen. There was a pushing and shuffling, a sound of heavy
feet as fresh people turned up to increase the pressure of the crowd.
People now were coming out of the houses. The doors of the “Jolly
Cricketers” stood suddenly wide open. Very little was said.

Kemp felt about, his hand seeming to pass through empty air. “He’s not
breathing,” he said, and then, “I can’t feel his heart. His side—ugh!”

Suddenly an old woman, peering under the arm of the big navvy, screamed
sharply. “Looky there!” she said, and thrust out a wrinkled finger.

And looking where she pointed, everyone saw, faint and transparent as
though it was made of glass, so that veins and arteries and bones and
nerves could be distinguished, the outline of a hand, a hand limp and
prone. It grew clouded and opaque even as they stared.

“Hullo!” cried the constable. “Here’s his feet a-showing!”

And so, slowly, beginning at his hands and feet and creeping along his
limbs to the vital centres of his body, that strange change continued.
It was like the slow spreading of a poison. First came the little white
nerves, a hazy grey sketch of a limb, then the glassy bones and
intricate arteries, then the flesh and skin, first a faint fogginess,
and then growing rapidly dense and opaque. Presently they could see his
crushed chest and his shoulders, and the dim outline of his drawn and
battered features.

When at last the crowd made way for Kemp to stand erect, there lay,
naked and pitiful on the ground, the bruised and broken body of a young
man about thirty. His hair and brow were white—not grey with age, but
white with the whiteness of albinism—and his eyes were like garnets.
His hands were clenched, his eyes wide open, and his expression was one
of anger and dismay.

“Cover his face!” said a man. “For Gawd’s sake, cover that face!” and
three little children, pushing forward through the crowd, were suddenly
twisted round and sent packing off again.

Someone brought a sheet from the “Jolly Cricketers,” and having covered
him, they carried him into that house. And there it was, on a shabby
bed in a tawdry, ill-lighted bedroom, surrounded by a crowd of ignorant
and excited people, broken and wounded, betrayed and unpitied, that
Griffin, the first of all men to make himself invisible, Griffin, the
most gifted physicist the world has ever seen, ended in infinite
disaster his strange and terrible career.



THE EPILOGUE


So ends the story of the strange and evil experiments of the Invisible
Man. And if you would learn more of him you must go to a little inn
near Port Stowe and talk to the landlord. The sign of the inn is an
empty board save for a hat and boots, and the name is the title of this
story. The landlord is a short and corpulent little man with a nose of
cylindrical proportions, wiry hair, and a sporadic rosiness of visage.
Drink generously, and he will tell you generously of all the things
that happened to him after that time, and of how the lawyers tried to
do him out of the treasure found upon him.

“When they found they couldn’t prove whose money was which, I’m
blessed,” he says, “if they didn’t try to make me out a blooming
treasure trove! Do I _look_ like a Treasure Trove? And then a gentleman
gave me a guinea a night to tell the story at the Empire Music
’All—just to tell ’em in my own words—barring one.”

And if you want to cut off the flow of his reminiscences abruptly, you
can always do so by asking if there weren’t three manuscript books in
the story. He admits there were and proceeds to explain, with
asseverations that everybody thinks _he_ has ’em! But bless you! he
hasn’t. “The Invisible Man it was took ’em off to hide ’em when I cut
and ran for Port Stowe. It’s that Mr. Kemp put people on with the idea
of _my_ having ’em.”

And then he subsides into a pensive state, watches you furtively,
bustles nervously with glasses, and presently leaves the bar.

He is a bachelor man—his tastes were ever bachelor, and there are no
women folk in the house. Outwardly he buttons—it is expected of him—but
in his more vital privacies, in the matter of braces for example, he
still turns to string. He conducts his house without enterprise, but
with eminent decorum. His movements are slow, and he is a great
thinker. But he has a reputation for wisdom and for a respectable
parsimony in the village, and his knowledge of the roads of the South
of England would beat Cobbett.

And on Sunday mornings, every Sunday morning, all the year round, while
he is closed to the outer world, and every night after ten, he goes
into his bar parlour, bearing a glass of gin faintly tinged with water,
and having placed this down, he locks the door and examines the blinds,
and even looks under the table. And then, being satisfied of his
solitude, he unlocks the cupboard and a box in the cupboard and a
drawer in that box, and produces three volumes bound in brown leather,
and places them solemnly in the middle of the table. The covers are
weather-worn and tinged with an algal green—for once they sojourned in
a ditch and some of the pages have been washed blank by dirty water.
The landlord sits down in an armchair, fills a long clay pipe
slowly—gloating over the books the while. Then he pulls one towards him
and opens it, and begins to study it—turning over the leaves backwards
and forwards.

His brows are knit and his lips move painfully. “Hex, little two up in
the air, cross and a fiddle-de-dee. Lord! what a one he was for
intellect!”

Presently he relaxes and leans back, and blinks through his smoke
across the room at things invisible to other eyes. “Full of secrets,”
he says. “Wonderful secrets!”

“Once I get the haul of them—_Lord_!”

“I wouldn’t do what _he_ did; I’d just—well!” He pulls at his pipe.

So he lapses into a dream, the undying wonderful dream of his life. And
though Kemp has fished unceasingly, no human being save the landlord
knows those books are there, with the subtle secret of invisibility and
a dozen other strange secrets written therein. And none other will know
of them until he dies.

INTRODUCTION


This volume does not aim to contain all “the best American humorous
short stories”; there are many other stories equally as good, I
suppose, in much the same vein, scattered through the range of
American literature. I have tried to keep a certain unity of aim
and impression in selecting these stories. In the first place I
determined that the pieces of brief fiction which I included must
first of all be not merely good stories, but good short stories. I
put myself in the position of one who was about to select the best
short stories in the whole range of American literature,[1] but
who, just before he started to do this, was notified that he must
refrain from selecting any of the best American short stories that
did not contain the element of humor to a marked degree. But I have
kept in mind the wide boundaries of the term humor, and also the
fact that the humorous standard should be kept second—although a
close second—to the short story standard.

In view of the necessary limitations as to the volume’s size, I
could not hope to represent all periods of American literature
adequately, nor was this necessary in order to give examples of the
best that has been done in the short story in a humorous vein in
American literature. Probably all types of the short story of humor
are included here, at any rate. Not only copyright restrictions but
in a measure my own opinion have combined to exclude anything by
Joel Chandler Harris—_Uncle Remus_—from the collection. Harris is
primarily—in his best work—a humorist, and only secondarily a short
story writer. As a humorist he is of the first rank; as a writer of
short stories his place is hardly so high. His humor is not mere
funniness and diversion; he is a humorist in the fundamental and
large sense, as are Cervantes, Rabelais, and Mark Twain.

No book is duller than a book of jokes, for what is refreshing in
small doses becomes nauseating when perused in large assignments.
Humor in literature is at its best not when served merely by
itself but when presented along with other ingredients of literary
force in order to give a wide representation of life. Therefore
“professional literary humorists,” as they may be called, have
not been much considered in making up this collection. In the
history of American humor there are three names which stand out
more prominently than all others before Mark Twain, who, however,
also belongs to a wider classification: “Josh Billings” (Henry
Wheeler Shaw, 1815–1885), “Petroleum V. Nasby” (David Ross Locke,
1833–1888), and “Artemus Ward” (Charles Farrar Browne, 1834–1867).
In the history of American humor these names rank high; in the
field of American literature and the American short story they
do not rank so high. I have found nothing of theirs that was
first-class both as humor and as short story. Perhaps just below
these three should be mentioned George Horatio Derby (1823–1861),
author of _Phoenixiana_ (1855) and the _Squibob Papers_ (1859),
who wrote under the name “John Phoenix.” As has been justly said,
“Derby, Shaw, Locke and Browne carried to an extreme numerous
tricks already invented by earlier American humorists, particularly
the tricks of gigantic exaggeration and calm-faced mendacity, but
they are plainly in the main channel of American humor, which had
its origin in the first comments of settlers upon the conditions
of the frontier, long drew its principal inspiration from the
differences between that frontier and the more settled and compact
regions of the country, and reached its highest development in Mark
Twain, in his youth a child of the American frontier, admirer and
imitator of Derby and Browne, and eventually a man of the world
and one of its greatest humorists.”[2] Nor have such later writers
who were essentially humorists as “Bill Nye” (Edgar Wilson Nye,
1850–1896) been considered, because their work does not attain the
literary standard and the short story standard as creditably as it
does the humorous one. When we come to the close of the nineteenth
century the work of such men as “Mr. Dooley” (Finley Peter Dunne,
1867- ) and George Ade (1866- ) stands out. But while these two
writers successfully conform to the exacting critical requirements
of good humor and—especially the former—of good literature,
neither—though Ade more so—attains to the greatest excellence of
the short story. Mr. Dooley of the Archey Road is essentially a
wholesome and wide-poised humorous philosopher, and the author of
_Fables in Slang_ is chiefly a satirist, whether in fable, play or
what not.

This volume might well have started with something by Washington
Irving, I suppose many critics would say. It does not seem to me,
however, that Irving’s best short stories, such as _The Legend
of Sleepy Hollow_ and _Rip Van Winkle_, are essentially humorous
stories, although they are o’erspread with the genial light of
reminiscence. It is the armchair geniality of the eighteenth
century essayists, a constituent of the author rather than of his
material and product. Irving’s best humorous creations, indeed,
are scarcely short stories at all, but rather essaylike sketches,
or sketchlike essays. James Lawson (1799–1880) in his _Tales
and Sketches: by a Cosmopolite_ (1830), notably in _The Dapper
Gentleman’s Story_, is also plainly a follower of Irving. We come
to a different vein in the work of such writers as William Tappan
Thompson (1812–1882), author of the amusing stories in letter form,
_Major Jones’s Courtship_ (1840); Johnson Jones Hooper (1815–1862),
author of _Widow Rugby’s Husband, and Other Tales of Alabama_
(1851); Joseph G. Baldwin (1815–1864), who wrote _The Flush Times
of Alabama and Mississippi_ (1853); and Augustus Baldwin Longstreet
(1790–1870), whose _Georgia Scenes_ (1835) are as important in
“local color” as they are racy in humor. Yet none of these writers
yield the excellent short story which is also a good piece of
humorous literature. But they opened the way for the work of later
writers who did attain these combined excellences.

The sentimental vein of the midcentury is seen in the work of
Seba Smith (1792–1868), Eliza Leslie (1787–1858), Frances Miriam
Whitcher (“Widow Bedott,” 1811–1852), Mary W. Janvrin (1830–1870),
and Alice Bradley Haven Neal (1828–1863). The well-known work of
Joseph Clay Neal (1807–1847) is so all pervaded with caricature and
humor that it belongs with the work of the professional humorist
school rather than with the short story writers. To mention his
_Charcoal Sketches, or Scenes in a Metropolis_ (1837–1849) must
suffice. The work of Seba Smith is sufficiently expressed in his
title, _Way Down East, or Portraitures of Yankee Life_ (1854),
although his _Letters of Major Jack Downing_ (1833) is better
known. Of his single stories may be mentioned _The General Court
and Jane Andrews’ Firkin of Butter_ (October, 1847, _Graham’s
Magazine_). The work of Frances Miriam Whitcher (“Widow Bedott”)
is of somewhat finer grain, both as humor and in other literary
qualities. Her stories or sketches, such as _Aunt Magwire’s Account
of Parson Scrantum’s Donation Party_ (March, 1848, _Godey’s Lady’s
Book_) and _Aunt Magwire’s Account of the Mission to Muffletegawmy_
(July, 1859, _Godey’s_), were afterwards collected in _The Widow
Bedott Papers_ (1855-56-80). The scope of the work of Mary B. Haven
is sufficiently suggested by her story, _Mrs. Bowen’s Parlor and
Spare Bedroom_ (February, 1860, _Godey’s_), while the best stories
of Mary W. Janvrin include _The Foreign Count; or, High Art in
Tattletown_ (October, 1860, _Godey’s_) and _City Relations; or, the
Newmans’ Summer at Clovernook_ (November, 1861, _Godey’s_). The
work of Alice Bradley Haven Neal is of somewhat similar texture.
Her book, _The Gossips of Rivertown, with Sketches in Prose and
Verse_ (1850) indicates her field, as does the single title, _The
Third-Class Hotel_ (December, 1861, _Godey’s_). Perhaps the most
representative figure of this school is Eliza Leslie (1787–1858),
who as “Miss Leslie” was one of the most frequent contributors to
the magazines of the 1830’s, 1840’s and 1850’s. One of her best
stories is _The Watkinson Evening_ (December, 1846, _Godey’s Lady’s
Book_), included in the present volume; others are _The Batson
Cottage_ (November, 1846, _Godey’s Lady’s Book_) and _Juliet Irwin;
or, the Carriage People_ (June, 1847, _Godey’s Lady’s Book_).
One of her chief collections of stories is _Pencil Sketches_
(1833–1837). “Miss Leslie,” wrote Edgar Allan Poe, “is celebrated
for the homely naturalness of her stories and for the broad satire
of her comic style.” She was the editor of _The Gift_ one of the
best annuals of the time, and in that position perhaps exerted her
chief influence on American literature When one has read three or
four representative stories by these seven authors one can grasp
them all. Their titles as a rule strike the keynote. These writers,
except “the Widow Bedott,” are perhaps sentimentalists rather than
humorists in intention, but read in the light of later days their
apparent serious delineations of the frolics and foibles of their
time take on a highly humorous aspect.

George Pope Morris (1802–1864) was one of the founders of _The
New York Mirror_, and for a time its editor. He is best known as
the author of the poem, _Woodman, Spare That Tree_, and other
poems and songs. _The Little Frenchman and His Water Lots_ (1839),
the first story in the present volume, is selected not because
Morris was especially prominent in the field of the short story or
humorous prose but because of this single story’s representative
character. Edgar Allan Poe (1809–1849) follows with _The Angel of
the Odd_ (October, 1844, _Columbian Magazine_), perhaps the best
of his humorous stories. _The System of Dr. Tarr and Prof. Fether_
(November, 1845, _Graham’s Magazine_) may be rated higher, but it
is not essentially a humorous story. Rather it is incisive satire,
with too biting an undercurrent to pass muster in the company of
the genial in literature. Poe’s humorous stories as a whole have
tended to belittle rather than increase his fame, many of them
verging on the inane. There are some, however, which are at least
excellent fooling; few more than that.

Probably this is hardly the place for an extended discussion of
Poe, since the present volume covers neither American literature
as a whole nor the American short story in general, and Poe is
not a humorist in his more notable productions. Let it be said
that Poe invented or perfected—more exactly, perfected his own
invention of—the modern short story; that is his general and
supreme achievement. He also stands superlative for the quality
of three varieties of short stories, those of terror, beauty and
ratiocination. In the first class belong _A Descent into the
Maelstrom_ (1841), _The Pit and the Pendulum_ (1842), _The Black
Cat_ (1843), and _The Cask of Amontillado_ (1846). In the realm
of beauty his notable productions are _The Assignation_ (1834),
_Shadow: a Parable_ (1835), _Ligeia_ (1838), _The Fall of the House
of Usher_ (1839), _Eleonora_ (1841), and _The Masque of the Red
Death_ (1842). The tales of ratiocination—what are now generally
termed detective stories—include _The Murders in the Rue Morgue_
(1841) and its sequel, _The Mystery of Marie Rogêt_ (1842–1843),
_The Gold-Bug_ (1843), _The Oblong Box_ (1844), “_Thou Art the
Man_” (1844), and _The Purloined Letter_ (1844).

Then, too, Poe was a master of style, one of the greatest in
English prose, possibly the greatest since De Quincey, and quite
the most remarkable among American authors. Poe’s influence on the
short story form has been tremendous. Although the _effects_ of
structure may be astounding in their power or unexpectedness, yet
the _means_ by which these effects are brought about are purely
mechanical. Any student of fiction can comprehend them, almost
any practitioner of fiction with a bent toward form can fairly
master them. The merit of any short story production depends on
many other elements as well—the value of the structural element to
the production as a whole depends first on the selection of the
particular sort of structural scheme best suited to the story in
hand, and secondly, on the way in which this is _combined_ with
the piece of writing to form a well-balanced whole. Style is more
difficult to imitate than structure, but on the other hand _the
origin of structural influence_ is more difficult to trace than
that of style. So while, in a general way, we feel that Poe’s
influence on structure in the short story has been great, it is
difficult rather than obvious to trace particular instances. It
is felt in the advance of the general level of short story art.
There is nothing personal about structure—there is everything
personal about style. Poe’s style is both too much his own and
too superlatively good to be successfully imitated—whom have we
had who, even if he were a master of structural effects, could be
a second Poe? Looking at the matter in another way, Poe’s style
is not his own at all. There is nothing “personal” about it in
the petty sense of that term. Rather we feel that, in the case of
this author, universality has been attained. It was Poe’s good
fortune to be himself in style, as often in content, on a plane
of universal appeal. But in some general characteristics of his
style his work can be, not perhaps imitated, but emulated. Greater
vividness, deft impressionism, brevity that strikes instantly to a
telling effect—all these an author may have without imitating any
one’s style but rather imitating excellence. Poe’s “imitators” who
have amounted to anything have not tried to imitate him but to vie
with him. They are striving after perfectionism. Of course the sort
of good style in which Poe indulged is not the kind of style—or the
varieties of style—suited for all purposes, but for the purposes to
which it is adapted it may well be called supreme.

Then as a poet his work is almost or quite as excellent in a
somewhat more restricted range. In verse he is probably the best
artist in American letters. Here his sole pursuit was beauty,
both of form and thought; he is vivid and apt, intensely lyrical
but without much range of thought. He has deep intuitions but no
comprehensive grasp of life.

His criticism is, on the whole, the least important part of his
work. He had a few good and brilliant ideas which came at just the
right time to make a stir in the world, and these his logical mind
and telling style enabled him to present to the best advantage. As
a critic he is neither broad-minded, learned, nor comprehensive.
Nor is he, except in the few ideas referred to, deep. He is,
however, limitedly original—perhaps intensely original within his
narrow scope. But the excellences and limitations of Poe in any one
part of his work were his limitations and excellences in all.

As Poe’s best short stories may be mentioned: _Metzengerstein_
(Jan. 14, 1832, Philadelphia _Saturday Courier_), _Ms. Found in
a Bottle_ (October 19, 1833, _Baltimore Saturday Visiter_), _The
Assignation_ (January, 1834, _Godey’s Lady’s Book_), _Berenice_
(March, 1835, _Southern Literary Messenger_), _Morella_ (April,
1835, _Southern Literary Messenger_), _The Unparalleled Adventure
of One Hans Pfaall_ (June, 1835, _Southern Literary Messenger_),
_King Pest: a Tale Containing an Allegory_ (September, 1835,
_Southern Literary Messenger_), _Shadow: a Parable_ (September,
1835, _Southern Literary Messenger_), _Ligeia_ (September, 1838,
_American Museum_), _The Fall of the House of Usher_ (September,
1839, _Burton’s Gentleman’s Magazine_), _William Wilson_ (1839:
_Gift for_ 1840), _The Conversation of Eiros and Charmion_
(December, 1839, _Burton’s Gentleman’s Magazine_), _The Murders
in the Rue Morgue_ (April, 1841, _Graham’s Magazine_), _A Descent
into the Maelstrom_ (May, 1841, _Graham’s Magazine_), _Eleonora_
(1841: _Gift_ for 1842), _The Masque of the Red Death_ (May, 1842,
_Graham’s Magazine_), _The Pit and the Pendulum_ (1842: _Gift for
1843_), _The Tell-Tale Heart_ (January, 1843, _Pioneer_), _The
Gold-Bug_ (June 21 and 28, 1843, _Dollar Newspaper_), _The Black
Cat_ (August 19, 1843, _United States Saturday Post_), _The Oblong
Box_ (September, 1844, _Godey’s Lady’s Book_), _The Angel of the
Odd_ (October, 1844, _Columbian Magazine_), “_Thou Art the Man_”
(November, 1844, _Godey’s Lady’s Book_), _The Purloined Letter_
(1844: _Gift_ for 1845), _The Imp of the Perverse_ (July, 1845,
_Graham’s Magazine_), _The System of Dr. Tarr and Prof. Fether_
(November, 1845, _Graham’s Magazine_), _The Facts in the Case
of M. Valdemar_ (December, 1845, _American Whig Review_), _The
Cask of Amontillado_ (November, 1846, _Godey’s Lady’s Book_), and
_Lander’s Cottage_ (June 9, 1849, _Flag of Our Union_). Poe’s
chief collections are: _Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque_
(1840), _Tales_ (1845), and _The Works of the Late Edgar Allan Poe_
(1850–56). These titles have been dropped from recent editions of
his works, however, and the stories brought together under the
title _Tales_, or under subdivisions furnished by his editors, such
as _Tales of Ratiocination_, etc.

Caroline Matilda Stansbury Kirkland (1801–1864) wrote of the
frontier life of the Middle West in the mid-nineteenth century.
Her principal collection of short stories is _Western Clearings_
(1845), from which _The Schoolmaster’s Progress_, first published
in _The Gift_ for 1845 (out in 1844), is taken. Other stories
republished in that collection are _The Ball at Thram’s Huddle_
(April, 1840, _Knickerbocker Magazine_), _Recollections of the
Land-Fever_ (September, 1840, _Knickerbocker Magazine_), and _The
Bee-Tree_ (_The Gift_ for 1842; out in 1841). Her description of
the country schoolmaster, “a puppet cut out of shingle and jerked
by a string,” and the local color in general of this and other
stories give her a leading place among the writers of her period
who combined fidelity in delineating frontier life with sufficient
fictional interest to make a pleasing whole of permanent value.

George William Curtis (1824–1892) gained his chief fame as an
essayist, and probably became best known from the department which
he conducted, from 1853, as _The Editor’s Easy Chair_ for _Harper’s
Magazine_ for many years. His volume, _Prue and I_ (1856), contains
many fictional elements, and a story from it, _Titbottom’s
Spectacles_, which first appeared in Putnam’s Monthly for December,
1854, is given in this volume because it is a good humorous short
story rather than because of its author’s general eminence in
this field. Other stories of his worth noting are _The Shrouded
Portrait_ (in _The Knickerbocker Gallery_, 1855) and _The Millenial
Club_ (November, 1858, _Knickerbocker Magazine_).

Edward Everett Hale (1822–1909) is chiefly known as the author
of the short story, _The Man Without a Country_ (December, 1863,
_Atlantic Monthly_), but his venture in the comic vein, _My Double;
and How He Undid Me_ (September, 1859, _Atlantic Monthly_), is
equally worthy of appreciation. It was his first published story
of importance. Other noteworthy stories of his are: _The Brick
Moon_ (October, November and December, 1869, _Atlantic Monthly_),
_Life in the Brick Moon_ (February, 1870, _Atlantic Monthly_),
and _Susan’s Escort_ (May, 1890, _Harper’s Magazine_). His chief
volumes of short stories are: _The Man Without a Country, and
Other Tales_ (1868); _The Brick Moon, and Other Stories_ (1873);
_Crusoe in New York, and Other Tales_ (1880); and _Susan’s Escort,
and Others_ (1897). The stories by Hale which have made his fame
all show ability of no mean order; but they are characterized by
invention and ingenuity rather than by suffusing imagination.
There is not much homogeneity about Hale’s work. Almost any two
stories of his read as if they might have been written by different
authors. For the time being perhaps this is an advantage—his
stories charm by their novelty and individuality. In the long run,
however, this proves rather a handicap. True individuality, in
literature as in the other arts, consists not in “being different”
on different occasions—in different works—so much as in being
_samely_ different from other writers; in being _consistently_
one’s self, rather than diffusedly various selves. This does not
lessen the value of particular stories, of course. It merely
injures Hale’s fame as a whole. Perhaps some will chiefly feel not
so much that his stories are different among themselves, but that
they are not strongly anything—anybody’s—in particular, that they
lack strong personality. The pathway to fame is strewn with stray
exhibitions of talent. Apart from his purely literary productions,
Hale was one of the large moral forces of his time, through
“uplift” both in speech and the written word.

Oliver Wendell Holmes (1809–1894), one of the leading wits of
American literature, is not at all well known as a short story
writer, nor did he write many brief pieces of fiction. His fame
rests chiefly on his poems and on the _Breakfast-Table_ books
(1858-1860-1872-1890). _Old Ironsides_, _The Last Leaf_, _The
Chambered Nautilus_ and _Homesick in Heaven_ are secure of places
in the anthologies of the future, while his lighter verse has
made him one of the leading American writers of “familiar verse.”
Frederick Locker-Lampson in the preface to the first edition of his
_Lyra Elegantiarum_ (1867) declared that Holmes was “perhaps the
best living writer of this species of verse.” His trenchant attack
on _Homeopathy and Its Kindred Delusions_ (1842) makes us wonder
what would have been his attitude toward some of the beliefs of our
own day; Christian Science, for example. He might have “exposed”
it under some such title as _The Religio-Medical Masquerade_, or
brought the batteries of his humor to bear on it in the manner of
Robert Louis Stevenson’s fable, _Something In It_: “Perhaps there
is not much in it, as I supposed; but there is something in it
after all. Let me be thankful for that.” In Holmes’ long works of
fiction, Elsie Venner (1861), _The Guardian Angel_ (1867) and _A
Mortal Antipathy_ (1885), the method is still somewhat that of
the essayist. I have found a short piece of fiction by him in the
March, 1832, number of _The New England Magazine_, called _The
Début_, signed O.W.H. _The Story of Iris_ in _The Professor at the
Breakfast Table_, which ran in _The Atlantic_ throughout 1859, and
_A Visit to the Asylum for Aged and Decayed Punsters_ (January,
1861, _Atlantic_) are his only other brief fictions of which I
am aware. The last named has been given place in the present
selection because it is characteristic of a certain type and period
of American humor, although its short story qualities are not
particularly strong.

Samuel Langhorne Clemens (1835–1910), who achieved fame as “Mark
Twain,” is only incidentally a short story writer, although he
wrote many short pieces of fiction. His humorous quality, I mean,
is so preponderant, that one hardly thinks of the form. Indeed,
he is never very strong in fictional construction, and of the
modern short story art he evidently knew or cared little. He is
a humorist in the large sense, as are Rabelais and Cervantes,
although he is also a humorist in various restricted applications
of the word that are wholly American. _The Celebrated Jumping Frog
of Calaveras County_ was his first publication of importance, and
it saw the light in the Nov. 18, 1865, number of _The Saturday
Press_. It was republished in the collection, _The Celebrated
Jumping Frog of Calaveras County, and Other Sketches_, in 1867.
Others of his best pieces of short fiction are: _The Canvasser’s
Tale_ (December, 1876, _Atlantic Monthly_), _The £1,000,000 Bank
Note_ (January, 1893, _Century Magazine_), _The Esquimau Maiden’s
Romance_ (November, 1893, _Cosmopolitan_), _Traveling with a
Reformer_ (December, 1893, _Cosmopolitan_), _The Man That Corrupted
Hadleyburg_ (December, 1899, _Harper’s_), _A Double-Barrelled
Detective Story_ (January and February, 1902, _Harper’s_) _A Dog’s
Tale_ (December, 1903, _Harper’s_), and _Eve’s Diary_ (December,
1905, _Harper’s_). Among Twain’s chief collections of short
stories are: _The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,
and Other Sketches_ (1867); _The Stolen White Elephant_ (1882),
_The £1,000,000 Bank Note_ (1893), and _The Man That Corrupted
Hadleyburg, and Other Stories and Sketches_ (1900).

Harry Stillwell Edwards (1855– ), a native of Georgia, together
with Sarah Barnwell Elliott (? – ) and Will N. Harben (1858–1919)
have continued in the vein of that earlier writer, Augustus
Baldwin Longstreet (1790–1870), author of _Georgia Scenes_ (1835).
Edwards’ best work is to be found in his short stories of black
and white life after the manner of Richard Malcolm Johnston. He
has written several novels, but he is essentially a writer of
human-nature sketches. “He is humorous and picturesque,” says
Fred Lewis Pattee, “and often he is for a moment the master of
pathos, but he has added nothing new and nothing commandingly
distinctive.”[3] An exception to this might be made in favor of
_Elder Brown’s Backslide_ (August, 1885, _Harper’s_), a story in
which all the elements are so nicely balanced that the result
may well be called a masterpiece of objective humor and pathos.
Others of his short stories especially worthy of mention are: _Two
Runaways_ (July, 1886, _Century_), _Sister Todhunter’s Heart_
(July, 1887, _Century_), “_De Valley an’ de Shadder_” (January,
1888, _Century_), _An Idyl of “Sinkin’ Mount’in”_ (October,
1888, _Century_), _The Rival Souls_ (March, 1889, _Century_),
_The Woodhaven Goat_ (March, 1899, _Century_), and _The Shadow_
(December, 1906, _Century_). His chief collections are _Two
Runaways, and Other Stories_ (1889) and _His Defense, and Other
Stories_ (1898).

The most notable, however, of the group of short story writers of
Georgia life is perhaps Richard Malcolm Johnston (1822–1898). He
stands between Longstreet and the younger writers of Georgia life.
His first book was _Georgia Sketches, by an Old Man_ (1864). _The
Goose Pond School_, a short story, had been written in 1857; it
was not published, however, till it appeared in the November and
December, 1869, numbers of a Southern magazine, _The New Eclectic_,
over the pseudonym “Philemon Perch.” His famous _Dukesborough
Tales_ (1871–1874) was largely a republication of the earlier book.
Other noteworthy collections of his are: _Mr. Absalom Billingslea
and Other Georgia Folk_ (1888), _Mr. Fortner’s Marital Claims,
and Other Stories_ (1892), and _Old Times in Middle Georgia_
(1897). Among individual stories stand out: _The Organ-Grinder_
(July, 1870, _New Eclectic_), _Mr. Neelus Peeler’s Conditions_
(June, 1879, _Scribner’s Monthly_), _The Brief Embarrassment of
Mr. Iverson Blount_ (September, 1884, _Century_); _The Hotel
Experience of Mr. Pink Fluker_ (June, 1886, _Century_), republished
in the present collection; _The Wimpy Adoptions_ (February, 1887,
_Century_), _The Experiments of Miss Sally Cash_ (September, 1888,
_Century_), and _Our Witch_ (March, 1897, _Century_). Johnston
must be ranked almost with Bret Harte as a pioneer in “local
color” work, although his work had little recognition until his
_Dukesborough Tales_ were republished by Harper & Brothers in 1883.

Bret Harte (1839–1902) is mentioned here owing to the late date
of his story included in this volume, _Colonel Starbottle for
the Plaintiff_ (March, 1901, _Harper’s_), although his work as a
whole of course belongs to an earlier period of our literature.
It is now well-thumbed literary history that _The Luck of Roaring
Camp_ (August, 1868, _Overland_) and _The Outcasts of Poker Flat_
(January, 1869, _Overland_) brought him a popularity that, in its
suddenness and extent, had no precedent in American literature save
in the case of Mrs. Stowe and _Uncle Tom’s Cabin_. According to
Harte’s own statement, made in the retrospect of later years, he
set out deliberately to add a new province to American literature.
Although his work has been belittled because he has chosen
exceptional and theatric happenings, yet his real strength came
from his contact with Western life.

Irving and Dickens and other models served only to teach him his
art. “Finally,” says Prof. Pattee, “Harte was the parent of the
modern form of the short story. It was he who started Kipling and
Cable and Thomas Nelson Page. Few indeed have surpassed him in the
mechanics of this most difficult of arts. According to his own
belief, the form is an American product ... Harte has described
the genesis of his own art. It sprang from the Western humor and
was developed by the circumstances that surrounded him. Many of
his short stories are models. They contain not a superfluous word,
they handle a single incident with grapic power, they close without
moral or comment. The form came as a natural evolution from his
limitations and powers. With him the story must of necessity be
brief.... Bret Harte was the artist of impulse, the painter of
single burning moments, the flashlight photographer who caught
in lurid detail one dramatic episode in the life of a man or a
community and left the rest in darkness.”[4]

Harte’s humor is mostly “Western humor” There is not always
uproarious merriment, but there is a constant background of humor.
I know of no more amusing scene in American literature than that in
the courtroom when the Colonel gives his version of the deacon’s
method of signaling to the widow in Harte’s story included in the
present volume, _Colonel Starbottle for the Plaintiff_. Here is
part of it:

True to the instructions she had received from him, her lips
part in the musical utterance (the Colonel lowered his voice
in a faint falsetto, presumably in fond imitation of his fair
client) “Kerree!” Instantly the night becomes resonant with the
impassioned reply (the Colonel here lifted his voice in stentorian
tones), “Kerrow!” Again, as he passes, rises the soft “Kerree!”;
again, as his form is lost in the distance, comes back the deep
“Kerrow!”

While Harte’s stories all have in them a certain element or
background of humor, yet perhaps the majority of them are chiefly
romantic or dramatic even more than they are humorous.

Among the best of his short stories may be mentioned: _The Luck of
Roaring Camp_ (August, 1868, _Overland_), _The Outcasts of Poker
Flat_ (January, 1869, _Overland_), _Tennessee’s Partner_ (October,
1869, _Overland_), _Brown of Calaveras_ (March, 1870, _Overland_),
_Flip: a California Romance_ (in _Flip, and Other Stories_, 1882),
_Left Out on Lone Star Mountain_ (January, 1884, _Longman’s_), _An
Ingenue of the Sierras_ (July, 1894, _McClure’s_), _The Bell-Ringer
of Angel’s_ (in _The Bell-Ringer of Angel’s, and Other Stories_,
1894), _Chu Chu_ (in _The Bell-Ringer of Angel’s, and Other
Stories_, 1894), _The Man and the Mountain_ (in _The Ancestors of
Peter Atherly, and Other Tales_, 1897), _Salomy Jane’s Kiss_ (in
_Stories in Light and Shadow_, 1898), _The Youngest Miss Piper_
(February, 1900, _Leslie’s Monthly_), _Colonel Starbottle for the
Plaintiff_ (March, 1901, _Harper’s_), _A Mercury of the Foothills_
(July, 1901, _Cosmopolitan_), _Lanty Foster’s Mistake_ (December,
1901, _New England_), _An Ali Baba of the Sierras_ (January 4,
1902, _Saturday Evening Post_), and _Dick Boyle’s Business Card_
(in _Trent’s Trust, and Other Stories_, 1903). Among his notable
collections of stories are: _The Luck of Roaring Camp, and Other
Sketches_ (1870), _Flip, and Other Stories_ (1882), _On the
Frontier_ (1884), _Colonel Starbottle’s Client, and Some Other
People_ (1892), _A Protégé of Jack Hamlin’s, and Other Stories_
(1894), _The Bell-Ringer of Angel’s, and Other Stories_ (1894),
_The Ancestors of Peter Atherly, and Other Tales_ (1897), _Openings
in the Old Trail_ (1902), and _Trent’s Trust, and Other Stories_
(1903). The titles and makeup of several of his collections were
changed when they came to be arranged in the complete edition of
his works.[5]

Henry Cuyler Bunner (1855–1896) is one of the humorous geniuses
of American literature. He is equally at home in clever verse or
the brief short story. Prof. Fred Lewis Pattee has summed up his
achievement as follows: “Another [than Stockton] who did much to
advance the short story toward the mechanical perfection it had
attained to at the close of the century was Henry Cuyler Bunner,
editor of _Puck_ and creator of some of the most exquisite _vers de
société_ of the period. The title of one of his collections, _Made
in France: French Tales Retold with a U.S. Twist_ (1893), forms an
introduction to his fiction. Not that he was an imitator; few have
been more original or have put more of their own personality into
their work. His genius was Gallic. Like Aldrich, he approached the
short story from the fastidious standpoint of the lyric poet. With
him, as with Aldrich, art was a matter of exquisite touches, of
infinite compression, of almost imperceptible shadings. The lurid
splashes and the heavy emphasis of the local colorists offended his
sensitive taste: he would work with suggestion, with microscopic
focussings, and always with dignity and elegance. He was more
American than Henry James, more even than Aldrich. He chose always
distinctively American subjects—New York City was his favorite
theme—and his work had more depth of soul than Stockton’s or
Aldrich’s. The story may be trivial, a mere expanded anecdote, yet
it is sure to be so vitally treated that, like Maupassant’s work,
it grips and remains, and, what is more, it lifts and chastens or
explains. It may be said with assurance that _Short Sixes_ marks
one of the high places which have been attained by the American
short story.”[6]

Among Bunner’s best stories are: _Love in Old Cloathes_ (September,
1883, _Century), A Successful Failure_ (July, 1887, _Puck_), _The
Love-Letters of Smith_ (July 23, 1890, _Puck_) _The Nice People_
(July 30, 1890, _Puck_), _The Nine Cent-Girls_ (August 13, 1890,
_Puck_), _The Two Churches of ’Quawket_ (August 27, 1890, _Puck_),
_A Round-Up_ (September 10, 1890, _Puck_), _A Sisterly Scheme_
(September 24, 1890, _Puck_), _Our Aromatic Uncle_ (August, 1895,
_Scribner’s_), _The Time-Table Test_ (in _The Suburban Sage_,
1896). He collaborated with Prof. Brander Matthews in several
stories, notably in _The Documents in the Case_ (Sept., 1879,
_Scribner’s Monthly_). His best collections are: _Short Sixes:
Stories to be Read While the Candle Burns_ (1891), _More Short
Sixes_ (1894), and _Love in Old Cloathes, and Other Stories_ (1896).

After Poe and Hawthorne almost the first author in America to make
a vertiginous impression by his short stories was Bret Harte. The
wide and sudden popularity he attained by the publication of his
two short stories, _The Luck of Roaring Camp_ (1868) and _The
Outcasts of Poker Flat_ (1869), has already been noted.[7] But
one story just before Harte that astonished the fiction audience
with its power and art was Harriet Prescott Spofford’s (1835– )
_The Amber Gods_ (January and February, 1860, Atlantic), with its
startling ending, “I must have died at ten minutes past one.”
After Harte the next story to make a great sensation was Thomas
Bailey Aldrich’s _Marjorie Daw_ (April, 1873, _Atlantic_), a story
with a surprise at the end, as had been his _A Struggle for Life_
(July, 1867, _Atlantic_), although it was only _Marjorie Daw_ that
attracted much attention at the time. Then came George Washington
Cable’s (1844– ) “_Posson Jone’_,” (April 1, 1876, _Appleton’s
Journal_) and a little later Charles Egbert Craddock’s (1850– )
_The Dancin’ Party at Harrison’s Cove_ (May, 1878, _Atlantic_) and
_The Star in the Valley_ (November, 1878, _Atlantic_). But the
work of Cable and Craddock, though of sterling worth, won its way
gradually. Even Edward Everett Hale’s (1822–1909) _My Double; and
How He Undid Me_ (September, 1859, _Atlantic_) and _The Man Without
a Country_ (December, 1863, _Atlantic_) had fallen comparatively
still-born. The truly astounding short story successes, after Poe
and Hawthorne, then, were Spofford, Bret Harte and Aldrich. Next
came Frank Richard Stockton (1834–1902). “The interest created
by the appearance of _Marjorie Daw_,” says Prof. Pattee, “was
mild compared with that accorded to Frank R. Stockton’s _The
Lady or the Tiger?_ (1884). Stockton had not the technique of
Aldrich nor his naturalness and ease. Certainly he had not his
atmosphere of the _beau monde_ and his grace of style, but in
whimsicality and unexpectedness and in that subtle art that makes
the obviously impossible seem perfectly plausible and commonplace
he surpassed not only him but Edward Everett Hale and all others.
After Stockton and _The Lady or the Tiger?_ it was realized even
by the uncritical that short story writing had become a subtle
art and that the master of its subtleties had his reader at his
mercy.”[8] The publication of Stockton’s short stories covers
a period of over forty years, from _Mahala’s Drive_ (November,
1868, _Lippincott’s_) to _The Trouble She Caused When She Kissed_
(December, 1911, _Ladies’ Home Journal_), published nine years
after his death. Among the more notable of his stories may be
mentioned: _The Transferred Ghost_ (May, 1882, _Century_), _The
Lady or the Tiger?_ (November, 1882, _Century_), _The Reversible
Landscape_ (July, 1884, _Century_), _The Remarkable Wreck of the
“Thomas Hyke”_ (August, 1884, _Century_), _“His Wife’s Deceased
Sister”_ (January, 1884, _Century_), _A Tale of Negative Gravity_
(December, 1884, _Century_), _The Christmas Wreck_ (in _The
Christmas Wreck, and Other Stories_, 1886), _Amos Kilbright_
(in _Amos Kilbright, His Adscititious Experiences, with Other
Stories_, 1888), _Asaph_ (May, 1892, _Cosmopolitan_), _My Terminal
Moraine_ (April 26, 1892, Collier’s _Once a Week Library_), _The
Magic Egg_ (June, 1894, _Century_), _The Buller-Podington Compact_
(August, 1897, _Scribner’s_), and _The Widow’s Cruise_ (in _A
Story-Teller’s Pack_, 1897). Most of his best work was gathered
into the collections: _The Lady or the Tiger?, and Other Stories_
(1884), _The Bee-Man of Orn, and Other Fanciful Tales_ (1887),
_Amos Kilbright, His Adscititious Experiences, with Other Stories_
(1888), _The Clocks of Rondaine, and Other Stories_ (1892), _A
Chosen Few_ (1895), _A Story-Teller’s Pack_ (1897), and _The
Queen’s Museum, and Other Fanciful Tales_ (1906).

After Stockton and Bunner come O. Henry (1862–1910) and Jack London
(1876–1916), apostles of the burly and vigorous in fiction. Beside
or above them stand Henry James (1843–1916)—although he belongs
to an earlier period as well—Edith Wharton (1862– ), Alice Brown
(1857– ), Margaret Wade Deland (1857– ), and Katharine Fullerton
Gerould (1879– ), practitioners in all that O. Henry and London are
not, of the finer fields, the more subtle nuances of modern life.
With O. Henry and London, though perhaps less noteworthy, are to
be grouped George Randolph Chester (1869– ) and Irvin Shrewsbury
Cobb (1876– ). Then, standing rather each by himself, are Melville
Davisson Post (1871– ), a master of psychological mystery stories,
and Wilbur Daniel Steele (1886– ), whose work it is hard to
classify. These ten names represent much that is best in American
short story production since the beginning of the twentieth
century (1900). Not all are notable for humor; but inasmuch as any
consideration of the American humorous short story cannot be wholly
dissociated from a consideration of the American short story in
general, it has seemed not amiss to mention these authors here.
Although Sarah Orne Jewett (1849–1909) lived on into the twentieth
century and Mary E. Wilkins Freeman (1862– ) is still with us, the
best and most typical work of these two writers belongs in the last
two decades of the previous century. To an earlier period also
belong Charles Egbert Craddock (1850– ), George Washington Cable
(1844– ), Thomas Nelson Page (1853– ), Constance Fenimore Woolson
(1848–1894), Harriet Prescott Spofford (1835– ), Hamlin Garland
(1860– ), Ambrose Bierce (1842–?), Rose Terry Cooke (1827–1892),
and Kate Chopin (1851–1904).

“O. Henry” was the pen name adopted by William Sydney Porter.
He began his short story career by contributing _Whistling
Dick’s Christmas Stocking_ to _McClure’s Magazine_ in 1899. He
followed it with many stories dealing with Western and South-and
Central-American life, and later came most of his stories of
the life of New York City, in which field lies most of his best
work. He contributed more stories to the _New York World_ than
to any other one publication—as if the stories of the author who
later came to be hailed as “the American Maupassant” were not
good enough for the “leading” magazines but fit only for the
sensation-loving public of the Sunday papers! His first published
story that showed distinct strength was perhaps _A Blackjack
Bargainer_ (August, 1901, _Munsey’s_). He followed this with such
masterly stories as: _The Duplicity of Hargraves_ (February,
1902, _Junior Munsey_), _The Marionettes_ (April, 1902, _Black
Cat_), _A Retrieved Reformation_ (April, 1903, _Cosmopolitan_),
_The Guardian of the Accolade_ (May, 1903, _Cosmopolitan_), _The
Enchanted Kiss_ (February, 1904, _Metropolitan_), _The Furnished
Room_ (August 14, 1904, _New York World_), _An Unfinished Story_
(August, 1905, _McClure’s_), _The Count and the Wedding Guest_
(October 8, 1905, _New York World_), _The Gift of the Magi_
(December 10, 1905, _New York World_), _The Trimmed Lamp_ (August,
1906, _McClure’s_), _Phoebe_ (November, 1907, _Everybody’s_), _The
Hiding of Black Bill_ (October, 1908, _Everybody’s_), _No Story_
(June, 1909, _Metropolitan_), _A Municipal Report_ (November, 1909,
_Hampton’s_), _A Service of Love_ (in _The Four Million_, 1909),
_The Pendulum_ (in _The Trimmed Lamp_, 1910), _Brickdust Row_
(in _The Trimmed Lamp_, 1910), and _The Assessor of Success_ (in
_The Trimmed Lamp_, 1910). Among O. Henry’s best volumes of short
stories are: _The Four Million_ (1909), _Options_ (1909), _Roads
of Destiny_ (1909), _The Trimmed Lamp_ (1910), _Strictly Business:
More Stories of the Four Million_ (1910), _Whirligigs_ (1910), and
_Sixes and Sevens_ (1911).

“Nowhere is there anything just like them. In his best work—and
his tales of the great metropolis are his best—he is unique. The
soul of his art is unexpectedness. Humor at every turn there
is, and sentiment and philosophy and surprise. One never may be
sure of himself. The end is always a sensation. No foresight may
predict it, and the sensation always is genuine. Whatever else
O. Henry was, he was an artist, a master of plot and diction, a
genuine humorist, and a philosopher. His weakness lay in the very
nature of his art. He was an entertainer bent only on amusing and
surprising his reader. Everywhere brilliancy, but too often it is
joined to cheapness; art, yet art merging swiftly into caricature.
Like Harte, he cannot be trusted. Both writers on the whole may be
said to have lowered the standards of American literature, since
both worked in the surface of life with theatric intent and always
without moral background, O. Henry moves, but he never lifts. All
is fortissimo; he slaps the reader on the back and laughs loudly as
if he were in a bar-room. His characters, with few exceptions, are
extremes, caricatures. Even his shop girls, in the limning of whom
he did his best work, are not really individuals; rather are they
types, symbols. His work was literary vaudeville, brilliant, highly
amusing, and yet vaudeville.”[9] _The Duplicity of Hargraves_, the
story by O. Henry given in this volume, is free from most of his
defects. It has a blend of humor and pathos that puts it on a plane
of universal appeal.

George Randolph Chester (1869– ) gained distinction by creating
the genial modern business man of American literature who is not
content to “get rich quick” through the ordinary channels. Need
I say that I refer to that amazing compound of likeableness and
sharp practices, Get-Rich-Quick Wallingford? The story of his
included in this volume, _Bargain Day at Tutt House_ (June, 1905,
_McClure’s_), was nearly his first story; only two others, which
came out in _The Saturday Evening Post_ in 1903 and 1904, preceded
it. Its breathless dramatic action is well balanced by humor.
Other stories of his deserving of special mention are: _A Corner
in Farmers_ (February, 29, 1908, _Saturday Evening Post_), _A
Fortune in Smoke_ (March 14, 1908, _Saturday Evening Post_), _Easy
Money_ (November 14, 1908, _Saturday Evening Post_), _The Triple
Cross_ (December 5, 1908, _Saturday Evening Post_), _Spoiling
the Egyptians_ (December 26, 1908, _Saturday Evening Post_),
_Whipsawed!_ (January 16, 1909, _Saturday Evening Post_), _The
Bubble Bank_ (January 30 and February 6, 1909, _Saturday Evening
Post_), _Straight Business_ (February 27, 1909, _Saturday Evening
Post_), _Sam Turner: a Business Man’s Love Story_ (March 26, April
2 and 9, 1910, _Saturday Evening Post_), _Fundamental Justice_
(July 25, 1914, _Saturday Evening Post_), _A Scropper Patcher_
(October, 1916, _Everybody’s_), and _Jolly Bachelors_ (February,
1918, _Cosmopolitan_). His best collections are: _Get-Rich-Quick
Wallingford_ (1908), _Young Wallingford_ (1910), _Wallingford in
His Prime_ (1913), and _Wallingford and Blackie Daw_ (1913). It is
often difficult to find in his books short stories that one may
be looking for, for the reason that the titles of the individual
stories have been removed in order to make the books look like
novels subdivided into chapters.

Grace MacGowan Cooke (1863– ) is a writer all of whose work has
interest and perdurable stuff in it, but few are the authors whose
achievements in the American short story stand out as a whole. In
_A Call_ (August, 1906, _Harper’s_) she surpasses herself and is
not perhaps herself surpassed by any of the humorous short stories
that have come to the fore so far in America in the twentieth
century. The story is no less delightful in its fidelity to fact
and understanding of young human nature than in its relish of
humor. Some of her stories deserving of special mention are: _The
Capture of Andy Proudfoot_ (June, 1904, _Harper’s_), _In the
Strength of the Hills_ (December, 1905, _Metropolitan_), _The
Machinations of Ocoee Gallantine_ (April, 1906, _Century_), _A
Call_ (August, 1906, _Harper’s_), _Scott Bohannon’s Bond _(May
4, 1907, _Collier’s_), and _A Clean Shave_ (November, 1912,
_Century_). Her best short stories do not seem to have been
collected in volumes as yet, although she has had several notable
long works of fiction published, such as _The Power and the Glory_
(1910), and several good juveniles.

William James Lampton (?–1917), who was known to many of his
admirers as Will Lampton or as W.J.L. merely, was one of the most
unique and interesting characters of literary and Bohemian New York
from about 1895 to his death in 1917. I remember walking up Fifth
Avenue with him one Sunday afternoon just after he had shown me a
letter from the man who was then Comptroller of the Currency. The
letter was signed so illegibly that my companion was in doubts
as to the sender, so he suggested that we stop at a well-known
hotel at the corner of 59th Street, and ask the manager who the
Comptroller of the Currency then was, so that he might know whom
the letter was from. He said that the manager of a big hotel like
that, where many prominent people stayed, would be sure to know.
When this problem had been solved to our satisfaction, John Skelton
Williams proving to be the man, Lampton said, “Now you’ve told me
who he is, I’ll show you who I am.” So he asked for a copy of _The
American Magazine_ at a newsstand in the hotel corridor, opened it,
and showed the manager a full-page picture of himself clad in a
costume suggestive of the time of Christopher Columbus, with high
ruffs around his neck, that happened to appear in the magazine the
current month. I mention this incident to illustrate the lack of
conventionality and whimsical originality of the man, that stood
out no less forcibly in his writings than in his daily life. He had
little use for “doing the usual thing in the usual sort of way.” He
first gained prominence by his book of verse, _Yawps_ (1900). His
poems were free from convention in technique as well as in spirit,
although their chief innovation was simply that as a rule there
was no regular number of syllables in a line; he let the lines be
any length they wanted to be, to fit the sense or the length of
what he had to say. He once said to me that if anything of his was
remembered he thought it would be his poem, _Lo, the Summer Girl_.
His muse often took the direction of satire, but it was always
good-natured even when it hit the hardest. He had in his makeup
much of the detached philosopher, like Cervantes and Mark Twain.

There was something cosmic about his attitude to life, and this
showed in much that he did. He was the only American writer of
humorous verse of his day whom I always cared to read, or whose
lines I could remember more than a few weeks. This was perhaps
because his work was never _merely_ humorous, but always had a big
sweep of background to it, like the ruggedness of the Kentucky
mountains from which he came. It was Colonel George Harvey, then
editor of _Harper’s Weekly_, who had started the boom to make
Woodrow Wilson President. Wilson afterwards, at least seemingly,
repudiated his sponsor, probably because of Harvey’s identification
with various moneyed interests. Lampton’s poem on the subject, with
its refrain, “Never again, said Colonel George,” I remember as one
of the most notable of his poems on current topics. But what always
seemed to me the best of his poems dealing with matters of the hour
was one that I suggested he write, which dealt with gift-giving to
the public, at about the time that Andrew Carnegie was making a big
stir with his gifts for libraries, beginning:

      Dunno, perhaps
      One of the yaps
      Like me would make
      A holy break
      Doing his turn
      With money to burn.
            Anyhow, I
            Wouldn’t shy
            Making a try!

and containing, among many effective touches, the pathetic lines,

      . . . I’d help
      The poor who try to help themselves,
      Who have to work so hard for bread
      They can’t get very far ahead.

When James Lane Allen’s novel, _The Reign of Law_, came out (1900),
a little quatrain by Lampton that appeared in _The Bookman_
(September, 1900) swept like wildfire across the country, and was
read by a hundred times as many people as the book itself:

      “The Reign of Law”?
        Well, Allen, you’re lucky;
      It’s the first time it ever
        Rained law in Kentucky!

The reader need not be reminded that at that period Kentucky family
feuds were well to the fore. As Lampton had started as a poet, the
editors were bound to keep him pigeon-holed as far as they could,
and his ambition to write short stories was not at first much
encouraged by them. His predicament was something like that of the
chief character of Frank R. Stockton’s story, “_His Wife’s Deceased
Sister_” (January, 1884, _Century_), who had written a story so
good that whenever he brought the editors another story they
invariably answered in substance, “We’re afraid it won’t do. Can’t
you give us something like ‘_His Wife’s Deceased Sister_’?” This
was merely Stockton’s turning to account his own somewhat similar
experience with the editors after his story, _The Lady or the
Tiger_? (November, 1882, _Century_) appeared. Likewise the editors
didn’t want Lampton’s short stories for a while because they liked
his poems so well.

Do I hear some critics exclaiming that there is nothing remarkable
about _How the Widow Won the Deacon_, the story by Lampton
included in this volume? It handles an amusing situation lightly
and with grace. It is one of those things that read easily and
are often difficult to achieve. Among his best stories are: _The
People’s Number of the Worthyville Watchman_ (May 12, 1900,
_Saturday Evening Post_), _Love’s Strange Spell_ (April 27, 1901,
_Saturday Evening Post_), _Abimelech Higgins’ Way_ (August 24,
1001, _Saturday Evening Post_), _A Cup of Tea_ (March, 1902,
_Metropolitan_), _Winning His Spurs_ (May, 1904, _Cosmopolitan_),
_The Perfidy of Major Pulsifer_ (November, 1909, _Cosmopolitan_),
_How the Widow Won the Deacon_ (April, 1911, _Harper’s Bazaar_),
and _A Brown Study_ (December, 1913, _Lippincott’s_). There is no
collection as yet of his short stories. Although familiarly known
as “Colonel” Lampton, and although of Kentucky, he was not merely
a “Kentucky Colonel,” for he was actually appointed Colonel on the
staff of the governor of Kentucky. At the time of his death he was
about to be made a brigadier-general and was planning to raise a
brigade of Kentucky mountaineers for service in the Great War. As
he had just struck his stride in short story writing, the loss to
literature was even greater than the patriotic loss.

_Gideon_ (April, 1914, _Century_), by Wells Hastings (1878– ), the
story with which this volume closes, calls to mind the large number
of notable short stories in American literature by writers who have
made no large name for themselves as short story writers, or even
otherwise in letters. American literature has always been strong in
its “stray” short stories of note. In Mr. Hastings’ case, however,
I feel that the fame is sure to come. He graduated from Yale in
1902, collaborated with Brian Hooker (1880- ) in a novel, _The
Professor’s Mystery_ (1911) and alone wrote another novel, _The
Man in the Brown Derby_ (1911). His short stories include: _The
New Little Boy_ (July, 1911, _American_), _That Day_ (September,
1911, _American_), _The Pick-Up_ (December, 1911, _Everybody’s_),
and _Gideon_ (April, 1914, _Century_). The last story stands out.
It can be compared without disadvantage to the best work, or all
but the very best work, of Thomas Nelson Page, it seems to me. And
from the reader’s standpoint it has the advantage—is this not also
an author’s advantage?—of a more modern setting and treatment. Mr.
Hastings is, I have been told, a director in over a dozen large
corporations. Let us hope that his business activities will not
keep him too much away from the production of literature—for to
rank as a piece of literature, something of permanent literary
value, _Gideon_ is surely entitled.

THE LITTLE FRENCHMAN AND HIS WATER LOTS[10]

BY GEORGE POPE MORRIS (1802–1864)

      Look into those they call unfortunate,
      And, closer view’d, you’ll find they are unwise.—_Young._

      Let wealth come in by comely thrift,
      And not by any foolish shift:
              ’Tis haste
              Makes waste:
      Who gripes too hard the dry and slippery sand
      Holds none at all, or little, in his hand.—_Herrick_.

                    Let well alone.—_Proverb_.


How much real comfort every one might enjoy if he would be
contented with the lot in which heaven has cast him, and how much
trouble would be avoided if people would only “let well alone.” A
moderate independence, quietly and honestly procured, is certainly
every way preferable even to immense possessions achieved by the
wear and tear of mind and body so necessary to procure them. Yet
there are very few individuals, let them be doing ever so well in
the world, who are not always straining every nerve to do better;
and this is one of the many causes why failures in business so
frequently occur among us. The present generation seem unwilling to
“realize” by slow and sure degrees; but choose rather to set their
whole hopes upon a single cast, which either makes or mars them
forever!

Gentle reader, do you remember Monsieur Poopoo? He used to keep a
small toy-store in Chatham, near the corner of Pearl Street. You
must recollect him, of course. He lived there for many years, and
was one of the most polite and accommodating of shopkeepers. When a
juvenile, you have bought tops and marbles of him a thousand times.
To be sure you have; and seen his vinegar-visage lighted up with
a smile as you flung him the coppers; and you have laughed at his
little straight queue and his dimity breeches, and all the other
oddities that made up the everyday apparel of my little Frenchman.
Ah, I perceive you recollect him now.

Well, then, there lived Monsieur Poopoo ever since he came from
“dear, delightful Paris,” as he was wont to call the city of his
nativity—there he took in the pennies for his kickshaws—there he
laid aside five thousand dollars against a rainy day—there he
was as happy as a lark—and there, in all human probability, he
would have been to this very day, a respected and substantial
citizen, had he been willing to “let well alone.” But Monsieur
Poopoo had heard strange stories about the prodigious rise in
real estate; and, having understood that most of his neighbors
had become suddenly rich by speculating in lots, he instantly
grew dissatisfied with his own lot, forthwith determined to shut
up shop, turn everything into cash, and set about making money
in right-down earnest. No sooner said than done; and our quondam
storekeeper a few days afterward attended an extensive sale of real
estate, at the Merchants’ Exchange.

There was the auctioneer, with his beautiful and inviting
lithographic maps—all the lots as smooth and square and enticingly
laid out as possible—and there were the speculators—and there, in
the midst of them, stood Monsieur Poopoo.

“Here they are, gentlemen,” said he of the hammer, “the most
valuable lots ever offered for sale. Give me a bid for them!”

“One hundred each,” said a bystander.

“One hundred!” said the auctioneer, “scarcely enough to pay for the
maps. One hundred—going—and fifty—gone! Mr. H., they are yours.
A noble purchase. You’ll sell those same lots in less than a
fortnight for fifty thousand dollars profit!”

Monsieur Poopoo pricked up his ears at this, and was lost in
astonishment. This was a much easier way certainly of accumulating
riches than selling toys in Chatham Street, and he determined to
buy and mend his fortune without delay.

The auctioneer proceeded in his sale. Other parcels were offered
and disposed of, and all the purchasers were promised immense
advantages for their enterprise. At last came a more valuable
parcel than all the rest. The company pressed around the stand, and
Monsieur Poopoo did the same.

“I now offer you, gentlemen, these magnificent lots, delightfully
situated on Long Island, with valuable water privileges. Property
in fee—title indisputable—terms of sale, cash—deeds ready for
delivery immediately after the sale. How much for them? Give them a
start at something. How much?” The auctioneer looked around; there
were no bidders. At last he caught the eye of Monsieur Poopoo.
“Did you say one hundred, sir? Beautiful lots—valuable water
privileges—shall I say one hundred for you?”

“_Oui, monsieur_; I will give you von hundred dollar apiece, for de
lot vid de valuarble vatare privalege; _c’est ça_.”

“Only one hundred apiece for these sixty valuable lots—only one
hundred—going—going—going—gone!”

Monsieur Poopoo was the fortunate possessor. The auctioneer
congratulated him—the sale closed—and the company dispersed.

“_Pardonnez-moi, monsieur_,” said Poopoo, as the auctioneer
descended his pedestal, “you shall _excusez-moi_, if I shall go to
_votre bureau_, your counting-house, ver quick to make every ting
sure wid respec to de lot vid de valuarble vatare privalege. Von
leetle bird in de hand he vorth two in de tree, _c’est vrai_—eh?”

“Certainly, sir.”

“Vell den, _allons_.”

And the gentlemen repaired to the counting-house, where the
six thousand dollars were paid, and the deeds of the property
delivered. Monsieur Poopoo put these carefully in his pocket, and
as he was about taking his leave, the auctioneer made him a present
of the lithographic outline of the lots, which was a very liberal
thing on his part, considering the map was a beautiful specimen of
that glorious art. Poopoo could not admire it sufficiently. There
were his sixty lots, as uniform as possible, and his little gray
eyes sparkled like diamonds as they wandered from one end of the
spacious sheet to the other.

Poopoo’s heart was as light as a feather, and he snapped
his fingers in the very wantonness of joy as he repaired to
Delmonico’s, and ordered the first good French dinner that had
gladdened his palate since his arrival in America.

After having discussed his repast, and washed it down with a bottle
of choice old claret, he resolved upon a visit to Long Island to
view his purchase. He consequently immediately hired a horse and
gig, crossed the Brooklyn ferry, and drove along the margin of the
river to the Wallabout, the location in question.

Our friend, however, was not a little perplexed to find his
property. Everything on the map was as fair and even as possible,
while all the grounds about him were as undulated as they could
well be imagined, and there was an elbow of the East River
thrusting itself quite into the ribs of the land, which seemed to
have no business there. This puzzled the Frenchman exceedingly;
and, being a stranger in those parts, he called to a farmer in an
adjacent field.

“_Mon ami_, are you acquaint vid dis part of de country—eh?”

“Yes, I was born here, and know every inch of it.”

“Ah, _c’est bien_, dat vill do,” and the Frenchman got out of the
gig, tied the horse, and produced his lithographic map.

“Den maybe you vill have de kindness to show me de sixty lot vich I
have bought, vid de valuarble vatare privalege?”

The farmer glanced his eye over the paper.

“Yes, sir, with pleasure; if you will be good enough to _get into
my boat, I will row you out to them_!”

“Vat dat you say, sure?”

“My friend,” said the farmer, “this section of Long Island has
recently been bought up by the speculators of New York, and laid
out for a great city; but the principal street is only visible _at
low tide_. When this part of the East River is filled up, it will
be just there. Your lots, as you will perceive, are beyond it; _and
are now all under water_.”

At first the Frenchman was incredulous. He could not believe
his senses. As the facts, however, gradually broke upon him, he
shut one eye, squinted obliquely at the heavens—-the river—the
farmer—and then he turned away and squinted at them all over again!
There was his purchase sure enough; but then it could not be
perceived for there was a river flowing over it! He drew a box from
his waistcoat pocket, opened it, with an emphatic knock upon the
lid, took a pinch of snuff and restored it to his waistcoat pocket
as before. Poopoo was evidently in trouble, having “thoughts which
often lie too deep for tears”; and, as his grief was also too big
for words, he untied his horse, jumped into his gig, and returned
to the auctioneer in hot haste.

It was near night when he arrived at the auction-room—his horse in
a foam and himself in a fury. The auctioneer was leaning back in
his chair, with his legs stuck out of a low window, quietly smoking
a cigar after the labors of the day, and humming the music from the
last new opera.

“Monsieur, I have much plaisir to fin’ you, _chez vous_, at home.”

“Ah, Poopoo! glad to see you. Take a seat, old boy.”

“But I shall not take de seat, sare.”

“No—why, what’s the matter?”

“Oh, _beaucoup_ de matter. I have been to see de gran lot vot you
sell me to-day.”

“Well, sir, I hope you like your purchase?”

“No, monsieur, I no like him.”

“I’m sorry for it; but there is no ground for your complaint.”

“No, sare; dare is no _ground_ at all—de ground is all vatare!”

“You joke!”

“I no joke. I nevare joke; _je n’entends pas la raillerie_, Sare,
_voulez-vous_ have de kindness to give me back de money vot I pay!”

“Certainly not.”

“Den vill you be so good as to take de East River off de top of my
lot?”

“That’s your business, sir, not mine.”

“Den I make von _mauvaise affaire_—von gran mistake!”

“I hope not. I don’t think you have thrown your money away in the
_land_.”

“No, sare; but I tro it avay in de _vatare!_”

“That’s not my fault.”

“Yes, sare, but it is your fault. You’re von ver gran rascal to
swindle me out of _de l’argent_.”

“Hello, old Poopoo, you grow personal; and if you can’t keep a
civil tongue in your head, you must go out of my counting-room.”

“Vare shall I go to, eh?”

“To the devil, for aught I care, you foolish old Frenchman!” said
the auctioneer, waxing warm.

“But, sare, I vill not go to de devil to oblige you!” replied the
Frenchman, waxing warmer. “You sheat me out of all de dollar vot I
make in Shatham Street; but I vill not go to de devil for all dat.
I vish you may go to de devil yourself you dem yankee-doo-dell, and
I vill go and drown myself, _tout de suite_, right avay.”

“You couldn’t make a better use of your water privileges, old boy!”

“Ah, _miséricorde_! Ah, _mon dieu, je suis abîmé_. I am ruin! I am
done up! I am break all into ten sousan leetle pieces! I am von
lame duck, and I shall vaddle across de gran ocean for Paris, vish
is de only valuarble vatare privalege dat is left me _à present_!”

Poor Poopoo was as good as his word. He sailed in the next packet,
and arrived in Paris almost as penniless as the day he left it.

Should any one feel disposed to doubt the veritable circumstances
here recorded, let him cross the East River to the Wallabout, and
farmer J—— will _row him out_ to the very place where the poor
Frenchman’s lots still remain _under water_.

THE ANGEL OF THE ODD[11]

BY EDGAR ALLAN POE (1809–1849)


It was a chilly November afternoon. I had just consummated an
unusually hearty dinner, of which the dyspeptic _truffe_ formed not
the least important item, and was sitting alone in the dining-room
with my feet upon the fender and at my elbow a small table which
I had rolled up to the fire, and upon which were some apologies
for dessert, with some miscellaneous bottles of wine, spirit, and
_liqueur_. In the morning I had been reading Glover’s _Leonidas_,
Wilkie’s _Epigoniad_, Lamartine’s _Pilgrimage_, Barlow’s
_Columbiad_, Tuckerman’s _Sicily_, and Griswold’s _Curiosities_, I
am willing to confess, therefore, that I now felt a little stupid.
I made effort to arouse myself by frequent aid of Lafitte, and all
failing, I betook myself to a stray newspaper in despair. Having
carefully perused the column of “Houses to let,” and the column
of “Dogs lost,” and then the columns of “Wives and apprentices
runaway,” I attacked with great resolution the editorial matter,
and reading it from beginning to end without understanding a
syllable, conceived the possibility of its being Chinese, and
so re-read it from the end to the beginning, but with no more
satisfactory result. I was about throwing away in disgust

      This folio of four pages, happy work
      Which not even critics criticise,

when I felt my attention somewhat aroused by the paragraph which
follows:

“The avenues to death are numerous and strange. A London paper
mentions the decease of a person from a singular cause. He was
playing at ‘puff the dart,’ which is played with a long needle
inserted in some worsted, and blown at a target through a tin tube.
He placed the needle at the wrong end of the tube, and drawing
his breath strongly to puff the dart forward with force, drew the
needle into his throat. It entered the lungs, and in a few days
killed him.”

Upon seeing this I fell into a great rage, without exactly knowing
why. “This thing,” I exclaimed, “is a contemptible falsehood—a poor
hoax—the lees of the invention of some pitiable penny-a-liner, of
some wretched concocter of accidents in Cocaigne. These fellows
knowing the extravagant gullibility of the age set their wits
to work in the imagination of improbable possibilities, of odd
accidents as they term them, but to a reflecting intellect (like
mine, I added, in parenthesis, putting my forefinger unconsciously
to the side of my nose), to a contemplative understanding such
as I myself possess, it seems evident at once that the marvelous
increase of late in these ‘odd accidents’ is by far the oddest
accident of all. For my own part, I intend to believe nothing
henceforward that has anything of the ‘singular’ about it.”

“Mein Gott, den, vat a vool you bees for dat!” replied one of
the most remarkable voices I ever heard. At first I took it for
a rumbling in my ears—such as a man sometimes experiences when
getting very drunk—but upon second thought, I considered the sound
as more nearly resembling that which proceeds from an empty barrel
beaten with a big stick; and, in fact, this I should have concluded
it to be, but for the articulation of the syllables and words.
I am by no means naturally nervous, and the very few glasses of
Lafitte which I had sipped served to embolden me a little, so that
I felt nothing of trepidation, but merely uplifted my eyes with a
leisurely movement and looked carefully around the room for the
intruder. I could not, however, perceive any one at all.

“Humph!” resumed the voice as I continued my survey, “you mus pe so
dronk as de pig den for not zee me as I zit here at your zide.”

Hereupon I bethought me of looking immediately before my nose, and
there, sure enough, confronting me at the table sat a personage
nondescript, although not altogether indescribable. His body was a
wine-pipe or a rum puncheon, or something of that character, and
had a truly Falstaffian air. In its nether extremity were inserted
two kegs, which seemed to answer all the purposes of legs. For arms
there dangled from the upper portion of the carcass two tolerably
long bottles with the necks outward for hands. All the head that
I saw the monster possessed of was one of those Hessian canteens
which resemble a large snuff-box with a hole in the middle of the
lid. This canteen (with a funnel on its top like a cavalier cap
slouched over the eyes) was set on edge upon the puncheon, with the
hole toward myself; and through this hole, which seemed puckered
up like the mouth of a very precise old maid, the creature was
emitting certain rumbling and grumbling noises which he evidently
intended for intelligible talk.

“I zay,” said he, “you mos pe dronk as de pig, vor zit dare and not
zee me zit ere; and I zay, doo, you mos pe pigger vool as de goose,
vor to dispelief vat iz print in de print. ’Tiz de troof—dat it
iz—ebery vord ob it.”

“Who are you, pray?” said I with much dignity, although somewhat
puzzled; “how did you get here? and what is it you are talking
about?”

“As vor ow I com’d ere,” replied the figure, “dat iz none of your
pizziness; and as vor vat I be talking apout, I be talk apout vat
I tink proper; and as vor who I be, vy dat is de very ting I com’d
here for to let you zee for yourself.”

“You are a drunken vagabond,” said I, “and I shall ring the bell
and order my footman to kick you into the street.”

“He! he! he!” said the fellow, “hu! hu! hu! dat you can’t do.”

“Can’t do!” said I, “what do you mean? I can’t do what?”

“Ring de pell,” he replied, attempting a grin with his little
villainous mouth.

Upon this I made an effort to get up in order to put my threat
into execution, but the ruffian just reached across the table very
deliberately, and hitting me a tap on the forehead with the neck
of one of the long bottles, knocked me back into the armchair from
which I had half arisen. I was utterly astounded, and for a moment
was quite at a loss what to do. In the meantime he continued his
talk.

“You zee,” said he, “it iz te bess vor zit still; and now you shall
know who I pe. Look at me! zee! I am te _Angel ov te Odd_.”

“And odd enough, too,” I ventured to reply; “but I was always under
the impression that an angel had wings.”

“Te wing!” he cried, highly incensed, “vat I pe do mit te wing?
Mein Gott! do you take me for a shicken?”

“No—oh, no!” I replied, much alarmed; “you are no chicken—certainly
not.”

“Well, den, zit still and pehabe yourself, or I’ll rap you again
mid me vist. It iz te shicken ab te wing, und te owl ab te wing,
und te imp ab te wing, und te head-teuffel ab te wing. Te angel ab
_not_ te wing, and I am te _Angel ov te Odd_.”

“And your business with me at present is—is——”

“My pizziness!” ejaculated the thing, “vy vat a low-bred puppy you
mos pe vor to ask a gentleman und an angel apout his pizziness!”

This language was rather more than I could bear, even from an
angel; so, plucking up courage, I seized a salt-cellar which lay
within reach, and hurled it at the head of the intruder. Either he
dodged, however, or my aim was inaccurate; for all I accomplished
was the demolition of the crystal which protected the dial of the
clock upon the mantelpiece. As for the Angel, he evinced his sense
of my assault by giving me two or three hard, consecutive raps upon
the forehead as before. These reduced me at once to submission,
and I am almost ashamed to confess that, either through pain or
vexation, there came a few tears into my eyes.

“Mein Gott!” said the Angel of the Odd, apparently much softened at
my distress; “mein Gott, te man is eder ferry dronk or ferry zorry.
You mos not trink it so strong—you mos put te water in te wine.
Here, trink dis, like a good veller, and don’t gry now—don’t!”

Hereupon the Angel of the Odd replenished my goblet (which was
about a third full of port) with a colorless fluid that he poured
from one of his hand-bottles. I observed that these bottles had
labels about their necks, and that these labels were inscribed
“Kirschenwässer.”

The considerate kindness of the Angel mollified me in no little
measure; and, aided by the water with which he diluted my port more
than once, I at length regained sufficient temper to listen to his
very extraordinary discourse. I cannot pretend to recount all that
he told me, but I gleaned from what he said that he was a genius
who presided over the _contretemps_ of mankind, and whose business
it was to bring about the _odd accidents_ which are continually
astonishing the skeptic. Once or twice, upon my venturing to
express my total incredulity in respect to his pretensions, he grew
very angry indeed, so that at length I considered it the wiser
policy to say nothing at all, and let him have his own way. He
talked on, therefore, at great length, while I merely leaned back
in my chair with my eyes shut, and amused myself with munching
raisins and filiping the stems about the room. But, by and by,
the Angel suddenly construed this behavior of mine into contempt.
He arose in a terrible passion, slouched his funnel down over his
eyes, swore a vast oath, uttered a threat of some character, which
I did not precisely comprehend, and finally made me a low bow and
departed, wishing me, in the language of the archbishop in “Gil
Bias,” _beaucoup de bonheur et un peu plus de bon sens_.

His departure afforded me relief. The _very_ few glasses of Lafitte
that I had sipped had the effect of rendering me drowsy, and I felt
inclined to take a nap of some fifteen or twenty minutes, as is my
custom after dinner. At six I had an appointment of consequence,
which it was quite indispensable that I should keep. The policy of
insurance for my dwelling-house had expired the day before; and
some dispute having arisen it was agreed that, at six, I should
meet the board of directors of the company and settle the terms
of a renewal. Glancing upward at the clock on the mantelpiece
(for I felt too drowsy to take out my watch), I had the pleasure
to find that I had still twenty-five minutes to spare. It was
half-past five; I could easily walk to the insurance office in
five minutes; and my usual siestas had never been known to exceed
five-and-twenty. I felt sufficiently safe, therefore, and composed
myself to my slumbers forthwith.

Having completed them to my satisfaction, I again looked toward the
timepiece, and was half inclined to believe in the possibility of
odd accidents when I found that, instead of my ordinary fifteen or
twenty minutes, I had been dozing only three; for it still wanted
seven-and-twenty of the appointed hour. I betook myself again
to my nap, and at length a second time awoke, when, to my utter
amazement, it still wanted twenty-seven minutes of six. I jumped
up to examine the clock, and found that it had ceased running. My
watch informed me that it was half-past seven; and, of course,
having slept two hours, I was too late for my appointment. “It
will make no difference,” I said: “I can call at the office in the
morning and apologize; in the meantime what can be the matter with
the clock?” Upon examining it I discovered that one of the raisin
stems which I had been filiping about the room during the discourse
of the Angel of the Odd had flown through the fractured crystal,
and lodging, singularly enough, in the keyhole, with an end
projecting outward, had thus arrested the revolution of the minute
hand.

“Ah!” said I, “I see how it is. This thing speaks for itself. A
natural accident, such as will happen now and then!”

I gave the matter no further consideration, and at my usual hour
retired to bed. Here, having placed a candle upon a reading stand
at the bed head, and having made an attempt to peruse some pages
of the _Omnipresence of the Deity_, I unfortunately fell asleep in
less than twenty seconds, leaving the light burning as it was.

My dreams were terrifically disturbed by visions of the Angel
of the Odd. Methought he stood at the foot of the couch, drew
aside the curtains, and in the hollow, detestable tones of a rum
puncheon, menaced me with the bitterest vengeance for the contempt
with which I had treated him. He concluded a long harangue by
taking off his funnel-cap, inserting the tube into my gullet, and
thus deluging me with an ocean of Kirschenwässer, which he poured
in a continuous flood, from one of the long-necked bottles that
stood him instead of an arm. My agony was at length insufferable,
and I awoke just in time to perceive that a rat had run off with
the lighted candle from the stand, but _not_ in season to prevent
his making his escape with it through the hole, Very soon a strong,
suffocating odor assailed my nostrils; the house, I clearly
perceived, was on fire. In a few minutes the blaze broke forth with
violence, and in an incredibly brief period the entire building
was wrapped in flames. All egress from my chamber, except through
a window, was cut off. The crowd, however, quickly procured and
raised a long ladder. By means of this I was descending rapidly,
and in apparent safety, when a huge hog, about whose rotund
stomach, and indeed about whose whole air and physiognomy, there
was something which reminded me of the Angel of the Odd—when
this hog, I say, which hitherto had been quietly slumbering in
the mud, took it suddenly into his head that his left shoulder
needed scratching, and could find no more convenient rubbing-post
than that afforded by the foot of the ladder. In an instant I was
precipitated, and had the misfortune to fracture my arm.

This accident, with the loss of my insurance, and with the more
serious loss of my hair, the whole of which had been singed off by
the fire, predisposed me to serious impressions, so that finally I
made up my mind to take a wife. There was a rich widow disconsolate
for the loss of her seventh husband, and to her wounded spirit I
offered the balm of my vows. She yielded a reluctant consent to
my prayers. I knelt at her feet in gratitude and adoration. She
blushed and bowed her luxuriant tresses into close contact with
those supplied me temporarily by Grandjean. I know not how the
entanglement took place but so it was. I arose with a shining pate,
wigless; she in disdain and wrath, half-buried in alien hair. Thus
ended my hopes of the widow by an accident which could not have
been anticipated, to be sure, but which the natural sequence of
events had brought about.

Without despairing, however, I undertook the siege of a less
implacable heart. The fates were again propitious for a brief
period, but again a trivial incident interfered. Meeting my
betrothed in an avenue thronged with the elite of the city, I was
hastening to greet her with one of my best considered bows, when
a small particle of some foreign matter lodging in the corner of
my eye rendered me for the moment completely blind. Before I could
recover my sight, the lady of my love had disappeared—irreparably
affronted at what she chose to consider my premeditated rudeness
in passing her by ungreeted. While I stood bewildered at
the suddenness of this accident (which might have happened,
nevertheless, to any one under the sun), and while I still
continued incapable of sight, I was accosted by the Angel of the
Odd, who proffered me his aid with a civility which I had no reason
to expect. He examined my disordered eye with much gentleness and
skill, informed me that I had a drop in it, and (whatever a “drop”
was) took it out, and afforded me relief.

I now considered it high time to die (since fortune had so
determined to persecute me), and accordingly made my way to
the nearest river. Here, divesting myself of my clothes (for
there is no reason why we cannot die as we were born), I threw
myself headlong into the current; the sole witness of my fate
being a solitary crow that had been seduced into the eating of
brandy-saturated corn, and so had staggered away from his fellows.
No sooner had I entered the water than this bird took it into his
head to fly away with the most indispensable portion of my apparel.
Postponing, therefore, for the present, my suicidal design, I just
slipped my nether extremities into the sleeves of my coat, and
betook myself to a pursuit of the felon with all the nimbleness
which the case required and its circumstances would admit. But my
evil destiny attended me still. As I ran at full speed, with my
nose up in the atmosphere, and intent only upon the purloiner of my
property, I suddenly perceived that my feet rested no longer upon
_terra firma_; the fact is, I had thrown myself over a precipice,
and should inevitably have been dashed to pieces but for my good
fortune in grasping the end of a long guide-rope, which depended
from a passing balloon.

As soon as I sufficiently recovered my senses to comprehend the
terrific predicament in which I stood, or rather hung, I exerted
all the power of my lungs to make that predicament known to the
aeronaut overhead. But for a long time I exerted myself in vain.
Either the fool could not, or the villain would not perceive me.
Meanwhile the machine rapidly soared, while my strength even more
rapidly failed. I was soon upon the point of resigning myself to
my fate, and dropping quietly into the sea, when my spirits were
suddenly revived by hearing a hollow voice from above, which seemed
to be lazily humming an opera air. Looking up, I perceived the
Angel of the Odd. He was leaning, with his arms folded, over the
rim of the car; and with a pipe in his mouth, at which he puffed
leisurely, seemed to be upon excellent terms with himself and the
universe. I was too much exhausted to speak, so I merely regarded
him with an imploring air.

For several minutes, although he looked me full in the face, he
said nothing. At length, removing carefully his meerschaum from the
right to the left corner of his mouth, he condescended to speak.

“Who pe you,” he asked, “und what der teuffel you pe do dare?”

To this piece of impudence, cruelty, and affectation, I could reply
only by ejaculating the monosyllable “Help!”

“Elp!” echoed the ruffian, “not I. Dare iz te pottle—elp yourself,
und pe tam’d!”

With these words he let fall a heavy bottle of Kirschenwässer,
which, dropping precisely upon the crown of my head, caused me to
imagine that my brains were entirely knocked out. Impressed with
this idea I was about to relinquish my hold and give up the ghost
with a good grace, when I was arrested by the cry of the Angel, who
bade me hold on.

“’Old on!” he said: “don’t pe in te ’urry—don’t. Will you pe take
de odder pottle, or ’ave you pe got zober yet, and come to your
zenzes?”

I made haste, hereupon, to nod my head twice—once in the negative,
meaning thereby that I would prefer not taking the other bottle
at present; and once in the affirmative, intending thus to imply
that I _was_ sober and _had_ positively come to my senses. By these
means I somewhat softened the Angel.

“Und you pelief, ten,” he inquired, “at te last? You pelief, ten,
in te possibility of te odd?”

I again nodded my head in assent.

“Und you ave pelief in _me_, te Angel of te Odd?”

I nodded again.

“Und you acknowledge tat you pe te blind dronk und te vool?”

I nodded once more.

“Put your right hand into your left preeches pocket, ten, in token
ov your vull zubmizzion unto te Angel ov te Odd.”

This thing, for very obvious reasons, I found it quite impossible
to do. In the first place, my left arm had been broken in my fall
from the ladder, and therefore, had I let go my hold with the
right hand I must have let go altogether. In the second place,
I could have no breeches until I came across the crow. I was
therefore obliged, much to my regret, to shake my head in the
negative, intending thus to give the Angel to understand that I
found it inconvenient, just at that moment, to comply with his very
reasonable demand! No sooner, however, had I ceased shaking my head
than—

“Go to der teuffel, ten!” roared the Angel of the Odd.

In pronouncing these words he drew a sharp knife across the
guide-rope by which I was suspended, and as we then happened to be
precisely over my own house (which, during my peregrinations, had
been handsomely rebuilt), it so occurred that I tumbled headlong
down the ample chimney and alit upon the dining-room hearth.

Upon coming to my senses (for the fall had very thoroughly
stunned me) I found it about four o’clock in the morning. I lay
outstretched where I had fallen from the balloon. My head groveled
in the ashes of an extinguished fire, while my feet reposed upon
the wreck of a small table, overthrown, and amid the fragments of a
miscellaneous dessert, intermingled with a newspaper, some broken
glasses and shattered bottles, and an empty jug of the Schiedam
Kirschenwässer. Thus revenged himself the Angel of the Odd.

THE SCHOOLMASTER’S PROGRESS[12]

By Caroline M.S. Kirkland (1801–1864)


Master William Horner came to our village to school when he
was about eighteen years old: tall, lank, straight-sided, and
straight-haired, with a mouth of the most puckered and solemn kind.
His figure and movements were those of a puppet cut out of shingle
and jerked by a string; and his address corresponded very well
with his appearance. Never did that prim mouth give way before a
laugh. A faint and misty smile was the widest departure from its
propriety, and this unaccustomed disturbance made wrinkles in the
flat, skinny cheeks like those in the surface of a lake, after the
intrusion of a stone. Master Horner knew well what belonged to the
pedagogical character, and that facial solemnity stood high on
the list of indispensable qualifications. He had made up his mind
before he left his father’s house how he would look during the
term. He had not planned any smiles (knowing that he must “board
round”), and it was not for ordinary occurrences to alter his
arrangements; so that when he was betrayed into a relaxation of the
muscles, it was “in such a sort” as if he was putting his bread and
butter in jeopardy.

Truly he had a grave time that first winter. The rod of power was
new to him, and he felt it his “duty” to use it more frequently
than might have been thought necessary by those upon whose sense
the privilege had palled. Tears and sulky faces, and impotent fists
doubled fiercely when his back was turned, were the rewards of
his conscientiousness; and the boys—and girls too—were glad when
working time came round again, and the master went home to help his
father on the farm.

But with the autumn came Master Horner again, dropping among us
as quietly as the faded leaves, and awakening at least as much
serious reflection. Would he be as self-sacrificing as before,
postponing his own ease and comfort to the public good, or would he
have become more sedentary, and less fond of circumambulating the
school-room with a switch over his shoulder? Many were fain to hope
he might have learned to smoke during the summer, an accomplishment
which would probably have moderated his energy not a little, and
disposed him rather to reverie than to action. But here he was, and
all the broader-chested and stouter-armed for his labors in the
harvest-field.

Let it not be supposed that Master Horner was of a cruel and
ogrish nature—a babe-eater—a Herod—one who delighted in torturing
the helpless. Such souls there may be, among those endowed
with the awful control of the ferule, but they are rare in the
fresh and natural regions we describe. It is, we believe, where
young gentlemen are to be crammed for college, that the process
of hardening heart and skin together goes on most vigorously.
Yet among the uneducated there is so high a respect for bodily
strength, that it is necessary for the schoolmaster to show, first
of all, that he possesses this inadmissible requisite for his
place. The rest is more readily taken for granted. Brains he _may_
have—a strong arm he _must_ have: so he proves the more important
claim first. We must therefore make all due allowance for Master
Horner, who could not be expected to overtop his position so far as
to discern at once the philosophy of teaching.

He was sadly brow-beaten during his first term of service by a
great broad-shouldered lout of some eighteen years or so, who
thought he needed a little more “schooling,” but at the same time
felt quite competent to direct the manner and measure of his
attempts.

“You’d ought to begin with large-hand, Joshuay,” said Master Horner
to this youth.

“What should I want coarse-hand for?” said the disciple, with
great contempt; “coarse-hand won’t never do me no good. I want a
fine-hand copy.”

The master looked at the infant giant, and did as he wished, but we
say not with what secret resolutions.

At another time, Master Horner, having had a hint from some one
more knowing than himself, proposed to his elder scholars to write
after dictation, expatiating at the same time quite floridly
(the ideas having been supplied by the knowing friend), upon the
advantages likely to arise from this practice, and saying, among
other things,

“It will help you, when you write letters, to spell the words good.”

“Pooh!” said Joshua, “spellin’ ain’t nothin’; let them that finds
the mistakes correct ’em. I’m for every one’s havin’ a way of their
own.”

“How dared you be so saucy to the master?” asked one of the little
boys, after school.

“Because I could lick him, easy,” said the hopeful Joshua, who knew
very well why the master did not undertake him on the spot.

Can we wonder that Master Horner determined to make his empire good
as far as it went?

A new examination was required on the entrance into a second term,
and, with whatever secret trepidation, the master was obliged to
submit. Our law prescribes examinations, but forgets to provide for
the competency of the examiners; so that few better farces offer
than the course of question and answer on these occasions. We know
not precisely what were Master Horner’s trials; but we have heard
of a sharp dispute between the inspectors whether a-n-g-e-l spelt
_angle_ or _angel_. _Angle_ had it, and the school maintained
that pronunciation ever after. Master Horner passed, and he was
requested to draw up the certificate for the inspectors to sign,
as one had left his spectacles at home, and the other had a bad
cold, so that it was not convenient for either to write more than
his name. Master Homer’s exhibition of learning on this occasion
did not reach us, but we know that it must have been considerable,
since he stood the ordeal.

“What is orthography?” said an inspector once, in our presence.

The candidate writhed a good deal, studied the beams overhead and
the chickens out of the window, and then replied,

“It is so long since I learnt the first part of the spelling-book,
that I can’t justly answer that question. But if I could just look
it over, I guess I could.”

Our schoolmaster entered upon his second term with new courage
and invigorated authority. Twice certified, who should dare doubt
his competency? Even Joshua was civil, and lesser louts of course
obsequious; though the girls took more liberties, for they feel
even at that early age, that influence is stronger than strength.

Could a young schoolmaster think of feruling a girl with her hair
in ringlets and a gold ring on her finger? Impossible—and the
immunity extended to all the little sisters and cousins; and there
were enough large girls to protect all the feminine part of the
school. With the boys Master Horner still had many a battle, and
whether with a view to this, or as an economical ruse, he never
wore his coat in school, saying it was too warm. Perhaps it was an
astute attention to the prejudices of his employers, who love no
man that does not earn his living by the sweat of his brow. The
shirt-sleeves gave the idea of a manual-labor school in one sense
at least. It was evident that the master worked, and that afforded
a probability that the scholars worked too.

Master Horner’s success was most triumphant that winter. A year’s
growth had improved his outward man exceedingly, filling out the
limbs so that they did not remind you so forcibly of a young
colt’s, and supplying the cheeks with the flesh and blood so
necessary where mustaches were not worn. Experience had given him
a degree of confidence, and confidence gave him power. In short,
people said the master had waked up; and so he had. He actually set
about reading for improvement; and although at the end of the term
he could not quite make out from his historical studies which side
Hannibal was on, yet this is readily explained by the fact that
he boarded round, and was obliged to read generally by firelight,
surrounded by ungoverned children.

After this, Master Horner made his own bargain. When schooltime
came round with the following autumn, and the teacher presented
himself for a third examination, such a test was pronounced no
longer necessary; and the district consented to engage him at the
astounding rate of sixteen dollars a month, with the understanding
that he was to have a fixed home, provided he was willing to
allow a dollar a week for it. Master Horner bethought him of the
successive “killing-times,” and consequent doughnuts of the twenty
families in which he had sojourned the years before, and consented
to the exaction.

Behold our friend now as high as district teacher can ever hope
to be—his scholarship established, his home stationary and not
revolving, and the good behavior of the community insured by the
fact that he, being of age, had now a farm to retire upon in case
of any disgust.

Master Horner was at once the preëminent beau of the neighborhood,
spite of the prejudice against learning. He brushed his hair
straight up in front, and wore a sky-blue ribbon for a guard to his
silver watch, and walked as if the tall heels of his blunt boots
were egg-shells and not leather. Yet he was far from neglecting the
duties of his place. He was beau only on Sundays and holidays; very
schoolmaster the rest of the time.

It was at a “spelling-school” that Master Horner first met the
educated eyes of Miss Harriet Bangle, a young lady visiting the
Engleharts in our neighborhood. She was from one of the towns
in Western New York, and had brought with her a variety of city
airs and graces somewhat caricatured, set off with year-old
French fashions much travestied. Whether she had been sent out
to the new country to try, somewhat late, a rustic chance for an
establishment, or whether her company had been found rather trying
at home, we cannot say. The view which she was at some pains to
make understood was, that her friends had contrived this method of
keeping her out of the way of a desperate lover whose addresses
were not acceptable to them.

If it should seem surprising that so high-bred a visitor should be
sojourning in the wild woods, it must be remembered that more than
one celebrated Englishman and not a few distinguished Americans
have farmer brothers in the western country, no whit less rustic
in their exterior and manner of life than the plainest of their
neighbors. When these are visited by their refined kinsfolk, we of
the woods catch glimpses of the gay world, or think we do.

      That great medicine hath
      With its tinct gilded—

many a vulgarism to the satisfaction of wiser heads than ours.

Miss Bangle’s manner bespoke for her that high consideration which
she felt to be her due. Yet she condescended to be amused by the
rustics and their awkward attempts at gaiety and elegance; and, to
say truth, few of the village merry-makings escaped her, though she
wore always the air of great superiority.

The spelling-school is one of the ordinary winter amusements in
the country. It occurs once in a fortnight, or so, and has power
to draw out all the young people for miles round, arrayed in
their best clothes and their holiday behavior. When all is ready,
umpires are elected, and after these have taken the distinguished
place usually occupied by the teacher, the young people of the
school choose the two best scholars to head the opposing classes.
These leaders choose their followers from the mass, each calling
a name in turn, until all the spellers are ranked on one side or
the other, lining the sides of the room, and all standing. The
schoolmaster, standing too, takes his spelling-book, and gives a
placid yet awe-inspiring look along the ranks, remarking that he
intends to be very impartial, and that he shall give out nothing
_that is not in the spelling-book_. For the first half hour or so
he chooses common and easy words, that the spirit of the evening
may not be damped by the too early thinning of the classes. When a
word is missed, the blunderer has to sit down, and be a spectator
only for the rest of the evening. At certain intervals, some of the
best speakers mount the platform, and “speak a piece,” which is
generally as declamatory as possible.

The excitement of this scene is equal to that afforded by any city
spectacle whatever; and towards the close of the evening, when
difficult and unusual words are chosen to confound the small number
who still keep the floor, it becomes scarcely less than painful.
When perhaps only one or two remain to be puzzled, the master,
weary at last of his task, though a favorite one, tries by tricks
to put down those whom he cannot overcome in fair fight. If among
all the curious, useless, unheard-of words which may be picked out
of the spelling-book, he cannot find one which the scholars have
not noticed, he gets the last head down by some quip or catch.
“Bay” will perhaps be the sound; one scholar spells it “bey,”
another, “bay,” while the master all the time means “ba,” which
comes within the rule, being _in the spelling-book_.

It was on one of these occasions, as we have said, that Miss
Bangle, having come to the spelling-school to get materials for a
letter to a female friend, first shone upon Mr. Horner. She was
excessively amused by his solemn air and puckered mouth, and set
him down at once as fair game. Yet she could not help becoming
somewhat interested in the spelling-school, and after it was over
found she had not stored up half as many of the schoolmaster’s
points as she intended, for the benefit of her correspondent.

In the evening’s contest a young girl from some few miles’
distance, Ellen Kingsbury, the only child of a substantial farmer,
had been the very last to sit down, after a prolonged effort on the
part of Mr. Horner to puzzle her, for the credit of his own school.
She blushed, and smiled, and blushed again, but spelt on, until
Mr. Horner’s cheeks were crimson with excitement and some touch
of shame that he should be baffled at his own weapons. At length,
either by accident or design, Ellen missed a word, and sinking into
her seat was numbered with the slain.

In the laugh and talk which followed (for with the conclusion
of the spelling, all form of a public assembly vanishes), our
schoolmaster said so many gallant things to his fair enemy, and
appeared so much animated by the excitement of the contest, that
Miss Bangle began to look upon him with rather more respect,
and to feel somewhat indignant that a little rustic like Ellen
should absorb the entire attention of the only beau. She put on,
therefore, her most gracious aspect, and mingled in the circle;
caused the schoolmaster to be presented to her, and did her best
to fascinate him by certain airs and graces which she had found
successful elsewhere. What game is too small for the close-woven
net of a coquette?

Mr. Horner quitted not the fair Ellen until he had handed her into
her father’s sleigh; and he then wended his way homewards, never
thinking that he ought to have escorted Miss Bangle to her uncle’s,
though she certainly waited a little while for his return.

We must not follow into particulars the subsequent intercourse
of our schoolmaster with the civilized young lady. All that
concerns us is the result of Miss Bangle’s benevolent designs
upon his heart. She tried most sincerely to find its vulnerable
spot, meaning no doubt to put Mr. Homer on his guard for the
future; and she was unfeignedly surprised to discover that her
best efforts were of no avail. She concluded he must have taken a
counter-poison, and she was not slow in guessing its source. She
had observed the peculiar fire which lighted up his eyes in the
presence of Ellen Kingsbury, and she bethought her of a plan which
would ensure her some amusement at the expense of these impertinent
rustics, though in a manner different somewhat from her original
more natural idea of simple coquetry.

A letter was written to Master Horner, purporting to come from
Ellen Kingsbury, worded so artfully that the schoolmaster
understood at once that it was intended to be a secret communication,
though its ostensible object was an inquiry about some ordinary
affair. This was laid in Mr. Horner’s desk before he came to school,
with an intimation that he might leave an answer in a certain spot
on the following morning. The bait took at once, for Mr. Horner,
honest and true himself, and much smitten with the fair Ellen, was
too happy to be circumspect. The answer was duly placed, and as duly
carried to Miss Bangle by her accomplice, Joe Englehart, an unlucky
pickle who “was always for ill, never for good,” and who found no
difficulty in obtaining the letter unwatched, since the master was
obliged to be in school at nine, and Joe could always linger a few
minutes later. This answer being opened and laughed at, Miss Bangle
had only to contrive a rejoinder, which being rather more particular
in its tone than the original communication, led on yet again the
happy schoolmaster, who branched out into sentiment, “taffeta
phrases, silken terms precise,” talked of hills and dales and
rivulets, and the pleasures of friendship, and concluded by
entreating a continuance of the correspondence.

Another letter and another, every one more flattering and
encouraging than the last, almost turned the sober head of our
poor master, and warmed up his heart so effectually that he
could scarcely attend to his business. The spelling-schools were
remembered, however, and Ellen Kingsbury made one of the merry
company; but the latest letter had not forgotten to caution Mr.
Horner not to betray the intimacy; so that he was in honor bound
to restrict himself to the language of the eyes hard as it was to
forbear the single whisper for which he would have given his very
dictionary. So, their meeting passed off without the explanation
which Miss Bangle began to fear would cut short her benevolent
amusement.

The correspondence was resumed with renewed spirit, and carried
on until Miss Bangle, though not overburdened with sensitiveness,
began to be a little alarmed for the consequences of her
malicious pleasantry. She perceived that she herself had turned
schoolmistress, and that Master Horner, instead of being merely
her dupe, had become her pupil too; for the style of his replies
had been constantly improving and the earnest and manly tone which
he assumed promised any thing but the quiet, sheepish pocketing
of injury and insult, upon which she had counted. In truth, there
was something deeper than vanity in the feelings with which he
regarded Ellen Kingsbury. The encouragement which he supposed
himself to have received, threw down the barrier which his extreme
bashfulness would have interposed between himself and any one who
possessed charms enough to attract him; and we must excuse him if,
in such a case, he did not criticise the mode of encouragement, but
rather grasped eagerly the proffered good without a scruple, or
one which he would own to himself, as to the propriety with which
it was tendered. He was as much in love as a man can be, and the
seriousness of real attachment gave both grace and dignity to his
once awkward diction.

The evident determination of Mr. Horner to come to the point of
asking papa brought Miss Bangle to a very awkward pass. She had
expected to return home before matters had proceeded so far, but
being obliged to remain some time longer, she was equally afraid
to go on and to leave off, a _dénouement_ being almost certain to
ensue in either case. Things stood thus when it was time to prepare
for the grand exhibition which was to close the winter’s term.

This is an affair of too much magnitude to be fully described in
the small space yet remaining in which to bring out our veracious
history. It must be “slubber’d o’er in haste”—its important
preliminaries left to the cold imagination of the reader—its fine
spirit perhaps evaporating for want of being embodied in words. We
can only say that our master, whose school-life was to close with
the term, labored as man never before labored in such a cause,
resolute to trail a cloud of glory after him when he left us. Not a
candlestick nor a curtain that was attainable, either by coaxing or
bribery, was left in the village; even the only piano, that frail
treasure, was wiled away and placed in one corner of the rickety
stage. The most splendid of all the pieces in the _Columbian
Orator_, the _American Speaker_, the——but we must not enumerate—in
a word, the most astounding and pathetic specimens of eloquence
within ken of either teacher or scholars, had been selected for the
occasion; and several young ladies and gentlemen, whose academical
course had been happily concluded at an earlier period, either
at our own institution or at some other, had consented to lend
themselves to the parts, and their choicest decorations for the
properties, of the dramatic portion of the entertainment.

Among these last was pretty Ellen Kingsbury, who had agreed to
personate the Queen of Scots, in the garden scene from Schiller’s
tragedy of _Mary Stuart_; and this circumstance accidentally
afforded Master Horner the opportunity he had so long desired,
of seeing his fascinating correspondent without the presence of
peering eyes. A dress-rehearsal occupied the afternoon before the
day of days, and the pathetic expostulations of the lovely Mary—

      Mine all doth hang—my life—my destiny—
      Upon my words—upon the force of tears!—

aided by the long veil, and the emotion which sympathy brought
into Ellen’s countenance, proved too much for the enforced
prudence of Master Horner. When the rehearsal was over, and the
heroes and heroines were to return home, it was found that, by a
stroke of witty invention not new in the country, the harness of
Mr. Kingsbury’s horses had been cut in several places, his whip
hidden, his buffalo-skins spread on the ground, and the sleigh
turned bottom upwards on them. This afforded an excuse for the
master’s borrowing a horse and sleigh of somebody, and claiming the
privilege of taking Miss Ellen home, while her father returned with
only Aunt Sally and a great bag of bran from the mill—companions
about equally interesting.

Here, then, was the golden opportunity so long wished for! Here
was the power of ascertaining at once what is never quite certain
until we have heard it from warm, living lips, whose testimony is
strengthened by glances in which the whole soul speaks or—seems to
speak. The time was short, for the sleighing was but too fine; and
Father Kingsbury, having tied up his harness, and collected his
scattered equipment, was driving so close behind that there was
no possibility of lingering for a moment. Yet many moments were
lost before Mr. Horner, very much in earnest, and all unhackneyed
in matters of this sort, could find a word in which to clothe
his new-found feelings. The horse seemed to fly—the distance was
half past—and at length, in absolute despair of anything better,
he blurted out at once what he had determined to avoid—a direct
reference to the correspondence.

A game at cross-purposes ensued; exclamations and explanations, and
denials and apologies filled up the time which was to have made
Master Horner so blest. The light from Mr. Kingsbury’s windows
shone upon the path, and the whole result of this conference so
longed for, was a burst of tears from the perplexed and mortified
Ellen, who sprang from Mr. Horner’s attempts to detain her, rushed
into the house without vouchsafing him a word of adieu, and left
him standing, no bad personification of Orpheus, after the last
hopeless flitting of his Eurydice.

“Won’t you ’light, Master?” said Mr. Kingsbury.

“Yes—no—thank you—good evening,” stammered poor Master Horner, so
stupefied that even Aunt Sally called him “a dummy.”

The horse took the sleigh against the fence, going home, and threw
out the master, who scarcely recollected the accident; while to
Ellen the issue of this unfortunate drive was a sleepless night and
so high a fever in the morning that our village doctor was called
to Mr. Kingsbury’s before breakfast.

Poor Master Horner’s distress may hardly be imagined. Disappointed,
bewildered, cut to the quick, yet as much in love as ever, he could
only in bitter silence turn over in his thoughts the issue of his
cherished dream; now persuading himself that Ellen’s denial was
the effect of a sudden bashfulness, now inveighing against the
fickleness of the sex, as all men do when they are angry with any
one woman in particular. But his exhibition must go on in spite of
wretchedness; and he went about mechanically, talking of curtains
and candles, and music, and attitudes, and pauses, and emphasis,
looking like a somnambulist whose “eyes are open but their sense is
shut,” and often surprising those concerned by the utter unfitness
of his answers.

It was almost evening when Mr. Kingsbury, having discovered,
through the intervention of the Doctor and Aunt Sally the cause
of Ellen’s distress, made his appearance before the unhappy
eyes of Master Horner, angry, solemn and determined; taking the
schoolmaster apart, and requiring, an explanation of his treatment
of his daughter. In vain did the perplexed lover ask for time
to clear himself, declare his respect for Miss Ellen and his
willingness to give every explanation which she might require; the
father was not to be put off; and though excessively reluctant,
Mr. Horner had no resource but to show the letters which alone
could account for his strange discourse to Ellen. He unlocked his
desk, slowly and unwillingly, while the old man’s impatience was
such that he could scarcely forbear thrusting in his own hand to
snatch at the papers which were to explain this vexatious mystery.
What could equal the utter confusion of Master Horner and the
contemptuous anger of the father, when no letters were to be
found! Mr. Kingsbury was too passionate to listen to reason, or to
reflect for one moment upon the irreproachable good name of the
schoolmaster. He went away in inexorable wrath; threatening every
practicable visitation of public and private justice upon the head
of the offender, whom he accused of having attempted to trick his
daughter into an entanglement which should result in his favor.

A doleful exhibition was this last one of our thrice approved and
most worthy teacher! Stern necessity and the power of habit enabled
him to go through with most of his part, but where was the proud
fire which had lighted up his eye on similar occasions before? He
sat as one of three judges before whom the unfortunate Robert Emmet
was dragged in his shirt-sleeves, by two fierce-looking officials;
but the chief judge looked far more like a criminal than did the
proper representative. He ought to have personated Othello, but
was obliged to excuse himself from raving for “the handkerchief!
the handkerchief!” on the rather anomalous plea of a bad cold.
_Mary Stuart_ being “i’ the bond,” was anxiously expected by the
impatient crowd, and it was with distress amounting to agony that
the master was obliged to announce, in person, the necessity of
omitting that part of the representation, on account of the illness
of one of the young ladies.

Scarcely had the words been uttered, and the speaker hidden his
burning face behind the curtain, when Mr. Kingsbury started up
in his place amid the throng, to give a public recital of his
grievance—no uncommon resort in the new country. He dashed at once
to the point; and before some friends who saw the utter impropriety
of his proceeding could persuade him to defer his vengeance, he had
laid before the assembly—some three hundred people, perhaps—his own
statement of the case. He was got out at last, half coaxed, half
hustled; and the gentle public only half understanding what had
been set forth thus unexpectedly, made quite a pretty row of it.
Some clamored loudly for the conclusion of the exercises; others
gave utterances in no particularly choice terms to a variety of
opinions as to the schoolmaster’s proceedings, varying the note
occasionally by shouting, “The letters! the letters! why don’t you
bring out the letters?”

At length, by means of much rapping on the desk by the president
of the evening, who was fortunately a “popular” character, order
was partially restored; and the favorite scene from Miss More’s
dialogue of David and Goliath was announced as the closing piece.
The sight of little David in a white tunic edged with red tape,
with a calico scrip and a very primitive-looking sling; and a huge
Goliath decorated with a militia belt and sword, and a spear like
a weaver’s beam indeed, enchained everybody’s attention. Even the
peccant schoolmaster and his pretended letters were forgotten,
while the sapient Goliath, every time that he raised the spear, in
the energy of his declamation, to thump upon the stage, picked away
fragments of the low ceiling, which fell conspicuously on his great
shock of black hair. At last, with the crowning threat, up went the
spear for an astounding thump, and down came a large piece of the
ceiling, and with it—a shower of letters.

The confusion that ensued beggars all description. A general
scramble took place, and in another moment twenty pairs of eyes,
at least, were feasting on the choice phrases lavished upon Mr.
Horner. Miss Bangle had sat through the whole previous scene,
trembling for herself, although she had, as she supposed, guarded
cunningly against exposure. She had needed no prophet to tell her
what must be the result of a tête-à-tête between Mr. Horner and
Ellen; and the moment she saw them drive off together, she induced
her imp to seize the opportunity of abstracting the whole parcel of
letters from Mr. Horner’s desk; which he did by means of a sort of
skill which comes by nature to such goblins; picking the lock by
the aid of a crooked nail, as neatly as if he had been born within
the shadow of the Tombs.

But magicians sometimes suffer severely from the malice with which
they have themselves inspired their familiars. Joe Englehart having
been a convenient tool thus far thought it quite time to torment
Miss Bangle a little; so, having stolen the letters at her bidding,
he hid them on his own account, and no persuasions of hers could
induce him to reveal this important secret, which he chose to
reserve as a rod in case she refused him some intercession with
his father, or some other accommodation, rendered necessary by his
mischievous habits.

He had concealed the precious parcels in the unfloored loft above
the school-room, a place accessible only by means of a small
trap-door without staircase or ladder; and here he meant to have
kept them while it suited his purposes, but for the untimely
intrusion of the weaver’s beam.

Miss Bangle had sat through all, as we have said, thinking the
letters safe, yet vowing vengeance against her confederate for
not allowing her to secure them by a satisfactory conflagration;
and it was not until she heard her own name whispered through the
crowd, that she was awakened to her true situation. The sagacity
of the low creatures whom she had despised showed them at once
that the letters must be hers, since her character had been pretty
shrewdly guessed, and the handwriting wore a more practised air
than is usual among females in the country. This was first taken
for granted, and then spoken of as an acknowledged fact.

The assembly moved like the heavings of a troubled sea. Everybody
felt that this was everybody’s business. “Put her out!” was
heard from more than one rough voice near the door, and this was
responded to by loud and angry murmurs from within.

Mr. Englehart, not waiting to inquire into the merits of the case
in this scene of confusion, hastened to get his family out as
quietly and as quickly as possible, but groans and hisses followed
his niece as she hung half-fainting on his arm, quailing completely
beneath the instinctive indignation of the rustic public. As she
passed out, a yell resounded among the rude boys about the door,
and she was lifted into a sleigh, insensible from terror. She
disappeared from that evening, and no one knew the time of her
final departure for “the east.”

Mr. Kingsbury, who is a just man when he is not in a passion, made
all the reparation in his power for his harsh and ill-considered
attack upon the master; and we believe that functionary did not
show any traits of implacability of character. At least he was
seen, not many days after, sitting peaceably at tea with Mr.
Kingsbury, Aunt Sally, and Miss Ellen; and he has since gone home
to build a house upon his farm. And people _do_ say, that after a
few months more, Ellen will not need Miss Bangle’s intervention if
she should see fit to correspond with the schoolmaster.

THE WATKINSON EVENING[13]

By Eliza Leslie (1787–1858)


Mrs. Morland, a polished and accomplished woman, was the widow of
a distinguished senator from one of the western states, of which,
also, her husband had twice filled the office of governor. Her
daughter having completed her education at the best boarding-school
in Philadelphia, and her son being about to graduate at Princeton,
the mother had planned with her children a tour to Niagara and
the lakes, returning by way of Boston. On leaving Philadelphia,
Mrs. Morland and the delighted Caroline stopped at Princeton to be
present at the annual commencement, and had the happiness of seeing
their beloved Edward receive his diploma as bachelor of arts;
after hearing him deliver, with great applause, an oration on the
beauties of the American character. College youths are very prone
to treat on subjects that imply great experience of the world.
But Edward Morland was full of kind feeling for everything and
everybody; and his views of life had hitherto been tinted with a
perpetual rose-color.

Mrs. Morland, not depending altogether upon the celebrity of her
late husband, and wishing that her children should see specimens
of the best society in the northern cities, had left home with
numerous letters of introduction. But when they arrived at New
York, she found to her great regret, that having unpacked and
taken out her small traveling desk, during her short stay in
Philadelphia, she had strangely left it behind in the closet
of her room at the hotel. In this desk were deposited all her
letters, except two which had been offered to her by friends in
Philadelphia. The young people, impatient to see the wonders of
Niagara, had entreated her to stay but a day or two in the city of
New York, and thought these two letters would be quite sufficient
for the present. In the meantime she wrote back to the hotel,
requesting that the missing desk should be forwarded to New York as
soon as possible.

On the morning after their arrival at the great commercial
metropolis of America, the Morland family took a carriage to ride
round through the principal parts of the city, and to deliver their
two letters at the houses to which they were addressed, and which
were both situated in the region that lies between the upper part
of Broadway and the North River. In one of the most fashionable
streets they found the elegant mansion of Mrs. St. Leonard; but
on stopping at the door, were informed that its mistress was not
at home. They then left the introductory letter (which they had
prepared for this mischance, by enclosing it in an envelope with
a card), and proceeding to another street considerably farther
up, they arrived at the dwelling of the Watkinson family, to the
mistress of which the other Philadelphia letter was directed. It
was one of a large block of houses all exactly alike, and all shut
up from top to bottom, according to a custom more prevalent in New
York than in any other city.

Here they were also unsuccessful; the servant who came to the
door telling them that the ladies were particularly engaged and
could see no company. So they left their second letter and card
and drove off, continuing their ride till they reached the Croton
water works, which they quitted the carriage to see and admire. On
returning to the hotel, with the intention after an hour or two of
rest to go out again, and walk till near dinner-time, they found
waiting them a note from Mrs. Watkinson, expressing her regret that
she had not been able to see them when they called; and explaining
that her family duties always obliged her to deny herself the
pleasure of receiving morning visitors, and that her servants had
general orders to that effect. But she requested their company for
that evening (naming nine o’clock as the hour), and particularly
desired an immediate answer.

“I suppose,” said Mrs. Morland, “she intends asking some of her
friends to meet us, in case we accept the invitation; and therefore
is naturally desirous of a reply as soon as possible. Of course
we will not keep her in suspense. Mrs. Denham, who volunteered
the letter, assured me that Mrs. Watkinson was one of the most
estimable women in New York, and a pattern to the circle in which
she moved. It seems that Mr. Denham and Mr. Watkinson are connected
in business. Shall we go?”

The young people assented, saying they had no doubt of passing a
pleasant evening.

The billet of acceptance having been written, it was sent off
immediately, entrusted to one of the errand-goers belonging to the
hotel, that it might be received in advance of the next hour for
the dispatch-post—and Edward Morland desired the man to get into
an omnibus with the note that no time might be lost in delivering
it. “It is but right”—said he to his mother—“that we should give
Mrs. Watkinson an ample opportunity of making her preparations, and
sending round to invite her friends.”

“How considerate you are, dear Edward”—said Caroline—“always so
thoughtful of every one’s convenience. Your college friends must
have idolized you.”

“No”—said Edward—“they called me a prig.” Just then a remarkably
handsome carriage drove up to the private door of the hotel. From
it alighted a very elegant woman, who in a few moments was ushered
into the drawing-room by the head waiter, and on his designating
Mrs. Morland’s family, she advanced and gracefully announced
herself as Mrs. St. Leonard. This was the lady at whose house they
had left the first letter of introduction. She expressed regret at
not having been at home when they called; but said that on finding
their letter, she had immediately come down to see them, and to
engage them for the evening. “Tonight”—said Mrs. St. Leonard—“I
expect as many friends as I can collect for a summer party. The
occasion is the recent marriage of my niece, who with her husband
has just returned from their bridal excursion, and they will be
soon on their way to their residence in Baltimore. I think I can
promise you an agreeable evening, as I expect some very delightful
people, with whom I shall be most happy to make you acquainted.”

Edward and Caroline exchanged glances, and could not refrain from
looking wistfully at their mother, on whose countenance a shade of
regret was very apparent. After a short pause she replied to Mrs.
St. Leonard—“I am truly sorry to say that we have just answered in
the affirmative a previous invitation for this very evening.”

“I am indeed disappointed”—said Mrs. St. Leonard, who had been
looking approvingly at the prepossessing appearance of the two
young people. “Is there no way in which you can revoke your
compliance with this unfortunate first invitation—at least, I am
sure, it is unfortunate for me. What a vexatious _contretemps_ that
I should have chanced to be out when you called; thus missing the
pleasure of seeing you at once, and securing that of your society
for this evening? The truth is, I was disappointed in some of the
preparations that had been sent home this morning, and I had to go
myself and have the things rectified, and was detained away longer
than I expected. May I ask to whom you are engaged this evening?
Perhaps I know the lady—if so, I should be very much tempted to go
and beg you from her.”

“The lady is Mrs. John Watkinson”—replied Mrs. Morland—“most
probably she will invite some of her friends to meet us.”

“That of course”—answered Mrs. St. Leonard—“I am really very
sorry—and I regret to say that I do not know her at all.”

“We shall have to abide by our first decision,” said Mrs. Morland.
“By Mrs. Watkinson, mentioning in her note the hour of nine, it
is to be presumed she intends asking some other company. I cannot
possibly disappoint her. I can speak feelingly as to the annoyance
(for I have known it by my own experience) when after inviting a
number of my friends to meet some strangers, the strangers have
sent an excuse almost at the eleventh hour. I think no inducements,
however strong, could tempt me to do so myself.”

“I confess that you are perfectly right,” said Mrs. St. Leonard.
“I see you must go to Mrs. Watkinson. But can you not divide the
evening, by passing a part of it with her and then finishing with
me?”

At this suggestion the eyes of the young people sparkled, for they
had become delighted with Mrs. St. Leonard, and imagined that a
party at her house must be every way charming. Also, parties were
novelties to both of them.

“If possible we will do so,” answered Mrs. Morland, “and with what
pleasure I need not assure you. We leave New York to-morrow, but we
shall return this way in September, and will then be exceedingly
happy to see more of Mrs. St. Leonard.”

After a little more conversation Mrs. St. Leonard took her leave,
repeating her hope of still seeing her new friends at her house
that night; and enjoining them to let her know as soon as they
returned to New York on their way home.

Edward Morland handed her to her carriage, and then joined his
mother and sister in their commendations of Mrs. St. Leonard,
with whose exceeding beauty were united a countenance beaming
with intelligence, and a manner that put every one at their ease
immediately.

“She is an evidence,” said Edward, “how superior our women of
fashion are to those of Europe.”

“Wait, my dear son,” said Mrs. Morland, “till you have been in
Europe, and had an opportunity of forming an opinion on that point
(as on many others) from actual observation. For my part, I believe
that in all civilized countries the upper classes of people are
very much alike, at least in their leading characteristics.”

“Ah! here comes the man that was sent to Mrs. Watkinson,” said
Caroline Morland. “I hope he could not find the house and has
brought the note back with him. We shall then be able to go at
first to Mrs. St. Leonard’s, and pass the whole evening there.”

The man reported that he _had_ found the house, and had delivered
the note into Mrs. Watkinson’s own hands, as she chanced to be
crossing the entry when the door was opened; and that she read it
immediately, and said “Very well.”

“Are you certain that you made no mistake in the house,” said
Edward, “and that you really _did_ give it to Mrs. Watkinson?”

“And it’s quite sure I am, sir,” replied the man, “when I first
came over from the ould country I lived with them awhile, and
though when she saw me to-day, she did not let on that she
remembered my doing that same, she could not help calling me James.
Yes, the rale words she said when I handed her the billy-dux was,
‘Very well, James.’”

“Come, come,” said Edward, when they found themselves alone, “let
us look on the bright side. If we do not find a large party at Mrs.
Watkinson’s, we may in all probability meet some very agreeable
people there, and enjoy the feast of reason and the flow of soul.
We may find the Watkinson house so pleasant as to leave it with
regret even for Mrs. St. Leonard’s.”

“I do not believe Mrs. Watkinson is in fashionable society,” said
Caroline, “or Mrs. St. Leonard would have known her. I heard some
of the ladies here talking last evening of Mrs. St. Leonard, and
I found from what they said that she is among the _élite_ of the
_lite_.”

“Even if she is,” observed Mrs. Morland, “are polish of manners and
cultivation of mind confined exclusively to persons of that class?”

“Certainly not,” said Edward, “the most talented and refined youth
at our college, and he in whose society I found the greatest
pleasure, was the son of a bricklayer.”

In the ladies’ drawing-room, after dinner, the Morlands heard a
conversation between several of the female guests, who all seemed
to know Mrs. St. Leonard very well by reputation, and they talked
of her party that was to “come off” on this evening.

“I hear,” said one lady, “that Mrs. St. Leonard is to have an
unusual number of lions.”

She then proceeded to name a gallant general, with his elegant wife
and accomplished daughter; a celebrated commander in the navy; two
highly distinguished members of Congress, and even an ex-president.
Also several of the most eminent among the American literati, and
two first-rate artists.

Edward Morland felt as if he could say, “Had I three ears I’d hear
thee.”

“Such a woman as Mrs. St. Leonard can always command the best lions
that are to be found,” observed another lady.

“And then,” said a third, “I have been told that she has such
exquisite taste in lighting and embellishing her always elegant
rooms. And her supper table, whether for summer or winter parties,
is so beautifully arranged; all the viands are so delicious, and
the attendance of the servants so perfect—and Mrs. St. Leonard does
the honors with so much ease and tact.”

“Some friends of mine that visit her,” said a fourth lady,
“describe her parties as absolute perfection. She always manages
to bring together those persons that are best fitted to enjoy each
other’s conversation. Still no one is overlooked or neglected. Then
everything at her reunions is so well proportioned—she has just
enough of music, and just enough of whatever amusement may add to
the pleasure of her guests; and still there is no appearance of
design or management on her part.”

“And better than all,” said the lady who had spoken firsts “Mrs.
St. Leonard is one of the kindest, most generous, and most
benevolent of women—she does good in every possible way.”

“I can listen no longer,” said Caroline to Edward, rising to
change her seat. “If I hear any more I shall absolutely hate the
Watkinsons. How provoking that they should have sent us the first
invitation. If we had only thought of waiting till we could hear
from Mrs. St. Leonard!”

“For shame, Caroline,” said her brother, “how can you talk so of
persons you have never seen, and to whom you ought to feel grateful
for the kindness of their invitation; even if it has interfered
with another party, that I must confess seems to offer unusual
attractions. Now I have a presentiment that we shall find the
Watkinson part of the evening very enjoyable.”

As soon as tea was over, Mrs. Morland and her daughter repaired to
their toilettes. Fortunately, fashion as well as good taste, has
decided that, at a summer party, the costume of the ladies should
never go beyond an elegant simplicity. Therefore our two ladies
in preparing for their intended appearance at Mrs. St. Leonard’s,
were enabled to attire themselves in a manner that would not seem
out of place in the smaller company they expected to meet at the
Watkinsons. Over an under-dress of lawn, Caroline Morland put on a
white organdy trimmed with lace, and decorated with bows of pink
ribbon. At the back of her head was a wreath of fresh and beautiful
pink flowers, tied with a similar ribbon. Mrs. Morland wore a black
grenadine over a satin, and a lace cap trimmed with white.

It was but a quarter past nine o’clock when their carriage stopped
at the Watkinson door. The front of the house looked very dark.
Not a ray gleamed through the Venetian shutters, and the glimmer
beyond the fan-light over the door was almost imperceptible. After
the coachman had rung several times, an Irish girl opened the door,
cautiously (as Irish girls always do), and admitted them into the
entry, where one light only was burning in a branch lamp. “Shall
we go upstairs?” said Mrs. Morland. “And what for would ye go
upstairs?” said the girl in a pert tone. “It’s all dark there, and
there’s no preparations. Ye can lave your things here a-hanging
on the rack. It is a party ye’re expecting? Blessed are them what
expects nothing.”

The sanguine Edward Morland looked rather blank at this
intelligence, and his sister whispered to him, “We’ll get off to
Mrs. St. Leonard’s as soon as we possibly can. When did you tell
the coachman to come for us?”

“At half past ten,” was the brother’s reply.

“Oh! Edward, Edward!” she exclaimed, “And I dare say he will not be
punctual. He may keep us here till eleven.”

“_Courage, mes enfants_,” said their mother, “_et parlez plus
doucement_.”

The girl then ushered them into the back parlor, saying, “Here’s
the company.”

The room was large and gloomy. A checquered mat covered the floor,
and all the furniture was encased in striped calico covers, and
the lamps, mirrors, etc. concealed under green gauze. The front
parlor was entirely dark, and in the back apartment was no other
light than a shaded lamp on a large centre table, round which
was assembled a circle of children of all sizes and ages. On a
backless, cushionless sofa sat Mrs. Watkinson, and a young lady,
whom she introduced as her daughter Jane. And Mrs. Morland in
return presented Edward and Caroline.

“Will you take the rocking-chair, ma’am?” inquired Mrs. Watkinson.

Mrs. Morland declining the offer, the hostess took it herself,
and see-sawed on it nearly the whole time. It was a very awkward,
high-legged, crouch-backed rocking-chair, and shamefully unprovided
with anything in the form of a footstool.

“My husband is away, at Boston, on business,” said Mrs. Watkinson.
“I thought at first, ma’am, I should not be able to ask you here
this evening, for it is not our way to have company in his absence;
but my daughter Jane over-persuaded me to send for you.”

“What a pity,” thought Caroline.

“You must take us as you find us, ma’am,” continued Mrs. Watkinson.
“We use no ceremony with anybody; and our rule is never to put
ourselves out of the way. We do not give parties [looking at the
dresses of the ladies]. Our first duty is to our children, and we
cannot waste our substance on fashion and folly. They’ll have cause
to thank us for it when we die.”

Something like a sob was heard from the centre table, at which the
children were sitting, and a boy was seen to hold his handkerchief
to his face.

“Joseph, my child,” said his mother, “do not cry. You have no idea,
ma’am, what an extraordinary boy that is. You see how the bare
mention of such a thing as our deaths has overcome him.”

There was another sob behind the handkerchief, and the Morlands
thought it now sounded very much like a smothered laugh.

“As I was saying, ma’am,” continued Mrs. Watkinson, “we never give
parties. We leave all sinful things to the vain and foolish. My
daughter Jane has been telling me, that she heard this morning of
a party that is going on to-night at the widow St. Leonard’s. It
is only fifteen years since her husband died. He was carried off
with a three days’ illness, but two months after they were married.
I have had a domestic that lived with them at the time, so I know
all about it. And there she is now, living in an elegant house,
and riding in her carriage, and dressing and dashing, and giving
parties, and enjoying life, as she calls it. Poor creature, how I
pity her! Thank heaven, nobody that I know goes to her parties. If
they did I would never wish to see them again in my house. It is
an encouragement to folly and nonsense—and folly and nonsense are
sinful. Do not you think so, ma’am?”

“If carried too far they may certainly become so,” replied Mrs.
Morland.

“We have heard,” said Edward, “that Mrs. St. Leonard, though one
of the ornaments of the gay world, has a kind heart, a beneficent
spirit and a liberal hand.”

“I know very little about her,” replied Mrs. Watkinson, drawing up
her head, “and I have not the least desire to know any more. It is
well she has no children; they’d be lost sheep if brought up in her
fold. For my part, ma’am,” she continued, turning to Mrs. Morland,
“I am quite satisfied with the quiet joys of a happy home. And no
mother has the least business with any other pleasures. My innocent
babes know nothing about plays, and balls, and parties; and they
never shall. Do they look as if they had been accustomed to a life
of pleasure?”

They certainly did not! for when the Morlands took a glance at
them, they thought they had never seen youthful faces that were
less gay, and indeed less prepossessing.

There was not a good feature or a pleasant expression among
them all. Edward Morland recollected his having often read
“that childhood is always lovely.” But he saw that the juvenile
Watkinsons were an exception to the rule.

“The first duty of a mother is to her children,” repeated Mrs.
Watkinson. “Till nine o’clock, my daughter Jane and myself are
occupied every evening in hearing the lessons that they have
learned for to-morrow’s school. Before that hour we can receive no
visitors, and we never have company to tea, as that would interfere
too much with our duties. We had just finished hearing these
lessons when you arrived. Afterwards the children are permitted to
indulge themselves in rational play, for I permit no amusement that
is not also instructive. My children are so well trained, that even
when alone their sports are always serious.”

Two of the boys glanced slyly at each other, with what Edward
Morland comprehended as an expression of pitch-penny and marbles.

“They are now engaged at their game of astronomy,” continued Mrs.
Watkinson. “They have also a sort of geography cards, and a set of
mathematical cards. It is a blessed discovery, the invention of
these educationary games; so that even the play-time of children
can be turned to account. And you have no idea, ma’am, how they
enjoy them.”

Just then the boy Joseph rose from the table, and stalking up to
Mrs. Watkinson, said to her, “Mamma, please to whip me.”

At this unusual request the visitors looked much amazed, and Mrs.
Watkinson replied to him, “Whip you, my best Joseph—for what cause?
I have not seen you do anything wrong this evening, and you know my
anxiety induces me to watch my children all the time.”

“You could not see me,” answered Joseph, “for I have not _done_
anything very wrong. But I have had a bad thought, and you know Mr.
Ironrule says that a fault imagined is just as wicked as a fault
committed.”

“You see, ma’am, what a good memory he has,” said Mrs. Watkinson
aside to Mrs. Morland. “But my best Joseph, you make your mother
tremble. What fault have you imagined? What was your bad thought?”

“Ay,” said another boy, “what’s your thought like?”

“My thought,” said Joseph, “was ‘Confound all astronomy, and I
could see the man hanged that made this game.’”

“Oh! my child,” exclaimed the mother, stopping her ears, “I am
indeed shocked. I am glad you repented so immediately.”

“Yes,” returned Joseph, “but I am afraid my repentance won’t last.
If I am not whipped, I may have these bad thoughts whenever I play
at astronomy, and worse still at the geography game. Whip me, ma,
and punish me as I deserve. There’s the rattan in the corner: I’ll
bring it to you myself.”

“Excellent boy!” said his mother. “You know I always pardon my
children when they are so candid as to confess their faults.”

“So you do,” said Joseph, “but a whipping will cure me better.”

“I cannot resolve to punish so conscientious a child,” said Mrs.
Watkinson.

“Shall I take the trouble off your hands?” inquired Edward, losing
all patience in his disgust at the sanctimonious hypocrisy of this
young Blifil. “It is such a rarity for a boy to request a whipping,
that so remarkable a desire ought by all means to be gratified.”

Joseph turned round and made a face at him.

“Give me the rattan,” said Edward, half laughing, and offering to
take it out of his hand. “I’ll use it to your full satisfaction.”

The boy thought it most prudent to stride off and return to the
table, and ensconce himself among his brothers and sisters; some of
whom were staring with stupid surprise; others were whispering and
giggling in the hope of seeing Joseph get a real flogging.

Mrs. Watkinson having bestowed a bitter look on Edward, hastened to
turn the attention of his mother to something else. “Mrs. Morland,”
said she, “allow me to introduce you to my youngest hope.” She
pointed to a sleepy boy about five years old, who with head thrown
back and mouth wide open, was slumbering in his chair.

Mrs. Watkinson’s children were of that uncomfortable species who
never go to bed; at least never without all manner of resistance.
All her boasted authority was inadequate to compel them; they never
would confess themselves sleepy; always wanted to “sit up,” and
there was a nightly scene of scolding, coaxing, threatening and
manoeuvring to get them off.

“I declare,” said Mrs. Watkinson, “dear Benny is almost asleep.
Shake him up, Christopher. I want him to speak a speech. His
schoolmistress takes great pains in teaching her little pupils to
speak, and stands up herself and shows them how.”

The child having been shaken up hard (two or three others helping
Christopher), rubbed his eyes and began to whine. His mother went
to him, took him on her lap, hushed him up, and began to coax him.
This done, she stood him on his feet before Mrs. Morland, and
desired him to speak a speech for the company. The child put his
thumb into his mouth, and remained silent.

“Ma,” said Jane Watkinson, “you had better tell him what speech to
speak.”

“Speak Cato or Plato,” said his mother. “Which do you call it? Come
now, Benny—how does it begin? ‘You are quite right and reasonable,
Plato.’ That’s it.”

“Speak Lucius,” said his sister Jane. “Come now, Benny—say ‘your
thoughts are turned on peace.’”

The little boy looked very much as if they were _not_, and as if
meditating an outbreak.

“No, no!” exclaimed Christopher, “let him say Hamlet. Come now,
Benny—‘To be or not to be.’”

“It ain’t to be at all,” cried Benny, “and I won’t speak the least
bit of it for any of you. I hate that speech!”

“Only see his obstinacy,” said the solemn Joseph. “And is he to be
given up to?”

“Speak anything, Benny,” said Mrs. Watkinson, “anything so that it
is only a speech.”

All the Watkinson voices now began to clamor violently at the
obstinate child—“Speak a speech! speak a speech! speak a speech!”
But they had no more effect than the reiterated exhortations with
which nurses confuse the poor heads of babies, when they require
them to “shake a day-day—shake a day-day!”

Mrs. Morland now interfered, and begged that the sleepy little boy
might be excused; on which he screamed out that “he wasn’t sleepy
at all, and would not go to bed ever.”

“I never knew any of my children behave so before,” said Mrs.
Watkinson. “They are always models of obedience, ma’am. A look
is sufficient for them. And I must say that they have in every
way profited by the education we are giving them. It is not our
way, ma’am, to waste our money in parties and fooleries, and
fine furniture and fine clothes, and rich food, and all such
abominations. Our first duty is to our children, and to make them
learn everything that is taught in the schools. If they go wrong,
it will not be for want of education. Hester, my dear, come and
talk to Miss Morland in French.”

Hester (unlike her little brother that would not speak a speech)
stepped boldly forward, and addressed Caroline Morland with:
“_Parlez-vous Français, mademoiselle? Comment se va madame votre
mère? Aimez-vous la musique? Aimez-vous la danse? Bon jour—bon
soir—bon repos. Comprenez-vous?_”

To this tirade, uttered with great volubility, Miss Morland made no
other reply than, “_Oui—je comprens_.”

“Very well, Hester—very well indeed,” said Mrs. Watkinson. “You
see, ma’am,” turning to Mrs. Morland, “how very fluent she is in
French; and she has only been learning eleven quarters.”

After considerable whispering between Jane and her mother, the
former withdrew, and sent in by the Irish girl a waiter with a
basket of soda biscuit, a pitcher of water, and some glasses. Mrs.
Watkinson invited her guests to consider themselves at home and
help themselves freely, saying: “We never let cakes, sweetmeats,
confectionery, or any such things enter the house, as they would be
very unwholesome for the children, and it would be sinful to put
temptation in their way. I am sure, ma’am, you will agree with me
that the plainest food is the best for everybody. People that want
nice things may go to parties for them; but they will never get any
with me.”

When the collation was over, and every child provided with a
biscuit, Mrs. Watkinson said to Mrs. Morland: “Now, ma’am, you
shall have some music from my daughter Jane, who is one of Mr.
Bangwhanger’s best scholars.”

Jane Watkinson sat down to the piano and commenced a powerful piece
of six mortal pages, which she played out of time and out of tune;
but with tremendous force of hands; notwithstanding which, it had,
however, the good effect of putting most of the children to sleep.

To the Morlands the evening had seemed already five hours long.
Still it was only half past ten when Jane was in the midst of her
piece. The guests had all tacitly determined that it would be best
not to let Mrs. Watkinson know their intention to go directly from
her house to Mrs. St. Leonard’s party; and the arrival of their
carriage would have been the signal of departure, even if Jane’s
piece had not reached its termination. They stole glances at the
clock on the mantel. It wanted but a quarter of eleven, when Jane
rose from the piano, and was congratulated by her mother on the
excellence of her music. Still no carriage was heard to stop; no
doorbell was heard to ring. Mrs. Morland expressed her fears that
the coachman had forgotten to come for them.

“Has he been paid for bringing you here?” asked Mrs. Watkinson.

“I paid him when we came to the door,” said Edward. “I thought
perhaps he might want the money for some purpose before he came for
us.”

“That was very kind in you, sir,” said Mrs. Watkinson, “but not
very wise. There’s no dependence on any coachman; and perhaps as he
may be sure of business enough this rainy night he may never come
at all—being already paid for bringing you here.”

Now, the truth was that the coachman _had_ come at the appointed
time, but the noise of Jane’s piano had prevented his arrival being
heard in the back parlor. The Irish girl had gone to the door when
he rang the bell, and recognized in him what she called “an ould
friend.” Just then a lady and gentleman who had been caught in
the rain came running along, and seeing a carriage drawing up at
a door, the gentleman inquired of the driver if he could not take
them to Rutgers Place. The driver replied that he had just come for
two ladies and a gentleman whom he had brought from the Astor House.

“Indeed and Patrick,” said the girl who stood at the door, “if I
was you I’d be after making another penny to-night. Miss Jane is
pounding away at one of her long music pieces, and it won’t be over
before you have time to get to Rutgers and back again. And if you
do make them wait awhile, where’s the harm? They’ve a dry roof over
their heads, and I warrant it’s not the first waiting they’ve ever
had in their lives; and it won’t be the last neither.”

“Exactly so,” said the gentleman; and regardless of the propriety
of first sending to consult the persons who had engaged the
carriage, he told his wife to step in, and following her instantly
himself, they drove away to Rutgers Place.

Reader, if you were ever detained in a strange house by the
non-arrival of your carriage, you will easily understand the
excessive annoyance of finding that you are keeping a family out
of their beds beyond their usual hour. And in this case, there was
a double grievance; the guests being all impatience to get off to
a better place. The children, all crying when wakened from their
sleep, were finally taken to bed by two servant maids, and Jane
Watkinson, who never came back again. None were left but Hester,
the great French scholar, who, being one of those young imps that
seem to have the faculty of living without sleep, sat bolt upright
with her eyes wide open, watching the uncomfortable visitors.

The Morlands felt as if they could bear it no longer, and Edward
proposed sending for another carriage to the nearest livery stable.

“We don’t keep a man now,” said Mrs. Watkinson, who sat nodding
in the rocking-chair, attempting now and then a snatch of
conversation, and saying “ma’am” still more frequently than usual.
“Men servants are dreadful trials, ma’am, and we gave them up three
years ago. And I don’t know how Mary or Katy are to go out this
stormy night in search of a livery stable.”

“On no consideration could I allow the women to do so,” replied
Edward. “If you will oblige me by the loan of an umbrella, I will
go myself.”

Accordingly he set out on this business, but was unsuccessful
at two livery stables, the carriages being all out. At last he
found one, and was driven in it to Mr. Watkinson’s house, where
his mother and sister were awaiting him, all quite ready, with
their calashes and shawls on. They gladly took their leave; Mrs.
Watkinson rousing herself to hope they had spent a pleasant
evening, and that they would come and pass another with her on
their return to New York. In such cases how difficult it is to
reply even with what are called “words of course.”

A kitchen lamp was brought to light them to the door, the entry
lamp having long since been extinguished. Fortunately the rain
had ceased; the stars began to reappear, and the Morlands, when
they found themselves in the carriage and on their way to Mrs. St.
Leonard’s, felt as if they could breathe again. As may be supposed,
they freely discussed the annoyances of the evening; but now those
troubles were over they felt rather inclined to be merry about them.

“Dear mother,” said Edward, “how I pitied you for having to endure
Mrs. Watkinson’s perpetual ‘ma’aming’ and ‘ma’aming’; for I know
you dislike the word.”

“I wish,” said Caroline, “I was not so prone to be taken with
ridiculous recollections. But really to-night I could not get that
old foolish child’s play out of my head—

      Here come three knights out of Spain
      A-courting of your daughter Jane.”

“_I_ shall certainly never be one of those Spanish knights,” said
Edward. “Her daughter Jane is in no danger of being ruled by any
‘flattering tongue’ of mine. But what a shame for us to be talking
of them in this manner.”

They drove to Mrs. St. Leonard’s, hoping to be yet in time to
pass half an hour there; though it was now near twelve o’clock
and summer parties never continue to a very late hour. But as
they came into the street in which she lived they were met by a
number of coaches on their way home, and on reaching the door of
her brilliantly lighted mansion, they saw the last of the guests
driving off in the last of the carriages, and several musicians
coming down the steps with their instruments in their hands.

“So there _has_ been a dance, then!” sighed Caroline. “Oh, what we
have missed! It is really too provoking.”

“So it is,” said Edward; “but remember that to-morrow morning we
set off for Niagara.”

“I will leave a note for Mrs. St. Leonard,” said his mother,
“explaining that we were detained at Mrs. Watkinson’s by our
coachman disappointing us. Let us console ourselves with the hope
of seeing more of this lady on our return. And now, dear Caroline,
you must draw a moral from the untoward events of to-day. When you
are mistress of a house, and wish to show civility to strangers,
let the invitation be always accompanied with a frank disclosure
of what they are to expect. And if you cannot conveniently invite
company to meet them, tell them at once that you will not insist
on their keeping their engagement with _you_ if anything offers
afterwards that they think they would prefer; provided only that
they apprize you in time of the change in their plan.”

“Oh, mamma,” replied Caroline, “you may be sure I shall always
take care not to betray my visitors into an engagement which they
may have cause to regret, particularly if they are strangers whose
time is limited. I shall certainly, as you say, tell them not to
consider themselves bound to me if they afterwards receive an
invitation which promises them more enjoyment. It will be a long
while before I forget, the Watkinson evening.”

TITBOTTOM’S SPECTACLES[14]

BY GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS (1824–1892)

    In my mind’s eye, Horatio.


Prue and I do not entertain much; our means forbid it. In truth,
other people entertain for us. We enjoy that hospitality of which
no account is made. We see the show, and hear the music, and smell
the flowers of great festivities, tasting as it were the drippings
from rich dishes. Our own dinner service is remarkably plain,
our dinners, even on state occasions, are strictly in keeping,
and almost our only guest is Titbottom. I buy a handful of roses
as I come up from the office, perhaps, and Prue arranges them so
prettily in a glass dish for the centre of the table that even when
I have hurried out to see Aurelia step into her carriage to go out
to dine, I have thought that the bouquet she carried was not more
beautiful because it was more costly. I grant that it was more
harmonious with her superb beauty and her rich attire. And I have
no doubt that if Aurelia knew the old man, whom she must have seen
so often watching her, and his wife, who ornaments her sex with as
much sweetness, although with less splendor, than Aurelia herself,
she would also acknowledge that the nosegay of roses was as fine
and fit upon their table as her own sumptuous bouquet is for
herself. I have that faith in the perception of that lovely lady.
It is at least my habit—I hope I may say, my nature, to believe the
best of people, rather than the worst. If I thought that all this
sparkling setting of beauty—this fine fashion—these blazing jewels
and lustrous silks and airy gauzes, embellished with gold-threaded
embroidery and wrought in a thousand exquisite elaborations, so
that I cannot see one of those lovely girls pass me by without
thanking God for the vision—if I thought that this was all, and
that underneath her lace flounces and diamond bracelets Aurelia was
a sullen, selfish woman, then I should turn sadly homewards, for I
should see that her jewels were flashing scorn upon the object they
adorned, and that her laces were of a more exquisite loveliness
than the woman whom they merely touched with a superficial grace.
It would be like a gaily decorated mausoleum—bright to see, but
silent and dark within.

“Great excellences, my dear Prue,” I sometimes allow myself to
say, “lie concealed in the depths of character, like pearls at
the bottom of the sea. Under the laughing, glancing surface, how
little they are suspected! Perhaps love is nothing else than the
sight of them by one person. Hence every man’s mistress is apt to
be an enigma to everybody else. I have no doubt that when Aurelia
is engaged, people will say that she is a most admirable girl,
certainly; but they cannot understand why any man should be in love
with her. As if it were at all necessary that they should! And
her lover, like a boy who finds a pearl in the public street, and
wonders as much that others did not see it as that he did, will
tremble until he knows his passion is returned; feeling, of course,
that the whole world must be in love with this paragon who cannot
possibly smile upon anything so unworthy as he.”

“I hope, therefore, my dear Mrs. Prue,” I continue to say to my
wife, who looks up from her work regarding me with pleased pride,
as if I were such an irresistible humorist, “you will allow me to
believe that the depth may be calm although the surface is dancing.
If you tell me that Aurelia is but a giddy girl, I shall believe
that you think so. But I shall know, all the while, what profound
dignity, and sweetness, and peace lie at the foundation of her
character.”

I say such things to Titbottom during the dull season at the
office. And I have known him sometimes to reply with a kind of dry,
sad humor, not as if he enjoyed the joke, but as if the joke must
be made, that he saw no reason why I should be dull because the
season was so.

“And what do I know of Aurelia or any other girl?” he says to
me with that abstracted air. “I, whose Aurelias were of another
century and another zone.”

Then he falls into a silence which it seems quite profane to
interrupt. But as we sit upon our high stools at the desk opposite
each other, I leaning upon my elbows and looking at him; he, with
sidelong face, glancing out of the window, as if it commanded a
boundless landscape, instead of a dim, dingy office court, I cannot
refrain from saying:

“Well!”

He turns slowly, and I go chatting on—a little too loquacious,
perhaps, about those young girls. But I know that Titbottom regards
such an excess as venial, for his sadness is so sweet that you
could believe it the reflection of a smile from long, long years
ago.

One day, after I had been talking for a long time, and we had put
up our books, and were preparing to leave, he stood for some time
by the window, gazing with a drooping intentness, as if he really
saw something more than the dark court, and said slowly:

“Perhaps you would have different impressions of things if you saw
them through my spectacles.”

There was no change in his expression. He still looked from the
window, and I said:

“Titbottom, I did not know that you used glasses. I have never seen
you wearing spectacles.”

“No, I don’t often wear them. I am not very fond of looking through
them. But sometimes an irresistible necessity compels me to put
them on, and I cannot help seeing.” Titbottom sighed.

“Is it so grievous a fate, to see?” inquired I.

“Yes; through my spectacles,” he said, turning slowly and looking
at me with wan solemnity.

It grew dark as we stood in the office talking, and taking our hats
we went out together. The narrow street of business was deserted.
The heavy iron shutters were gloomily closed over the windows. From
one or two offices struggled the dim gleam of an early candle, by
whose light some perplexed accountant sat belated, and hunting for
his error. A careless clerk passed, whistling. But the great tide
of life had ebbed. We heard its roar far away, and the sound stole
into that silent street like the murmur of the ocean into an inland
dell.

“You will come and dine with us, Titbottom?”

He assented by continuing to walk with me, and I think we were both
glad when we reached the house, and Prue came to meet us, saying:

“Do you know I hoped you would bring Mr. Titbottom to dine?”

Titbottom smiled gently, and answered:

“He might have brought his spectacles with him, and I have been a
happier man for it.”

Prue looked a little puzzled.

“My dear,” I said, “you must know that our friend, Mr. Titbottom,
is the happy possessor of a pair of wonderful spectacles. I have
never seen them, indeed; and, from what he says, I should be rather
afraid of being seen by them. Most short-sighted persons are very
glad to have the help of glasses; but Mr. Titbottom seems to find
very little pleasure in his.”

“It is because they make him too far-sighted, perhaps,” interrupted
Prue quietly, as she took the silver soup-ladle from the sideboard.

We sipped our wine after dinner, and Prue took her work. Can a man
be too far-sighted? I did not ask the question aloud. The very tone
in which Prue had spoken convinced me that he might.

“At least,” I said, “Mr. Titbottom will not refuse to tell us the
history of his mysterious spectacles. I have known plenty of magic
in eyes”—and I glanced at the tender blue eyes of Prue—“but I have
not heard of any enchanted glasses.”

“Yet you must have seen the glass in which your wife looks every
morning, and I take it that glass must be daily enchanted.” said
Titbottom, with a bow of quaint respect to my wife.

I do not think I have seen such a blush upon Prue’s cheek
since—well, since a great many years ago.

“I will gladly tell you the history of my spectacles,” began
Titbottom. “It is very simple; and I am not at all sure that a
great many other people have not a pair of the same kind. I have
never, indeed, heard of them by the gross, like those of our young
friend, Moses, the son of the Vicar of Wakefield. In fact, I think
a gross would be quite enough to supply the world. It is a kind
of article for which the demand does not increase with use. If we
should all wear spectacles like mine, we should never smile any
more. Oh—I am not quite sure—we should all be very happy.”

“A very important difference,” said Prue, counting her stitches.

“You know my grandfather Titbottom was a West Indian. A large
proprietor, and an easy man, he basked in the tropical sun,
leading his quiet, luxurious life. He lived much alone, and was
what people call eccentric, by which I understand that he was very
much himself, and, refusing the influence of other people, they
had their little revenges, and called him names. It is a habit
not exclusively tropical. I think I have seen the same thing even
in this city. But he was greatly beloved—my bland and bountiful
grandfather. He was so large-hearted and open-handed. He was so
friendly, and thoughtful, and genial, that even his jokes had the
air of graceful benedictions. He did not seem to grow old, and
he was one of those who never appear to have been very young. He
flourished in a perennial maturity, an immortal middle-age.

“My grandfather lived upon one of the small islands, St. Kit’s,
perhaps, and his domain extended to the sea. His house, a rambling
West Indian mansion, was surrounded with deep, spacious piazzas,
covered with luxurious lounges, among which one capacious chair
was his peculiar seat. They tell me he used sometimes to sit there
for the whole day, his great, soft, brown eyes fastened upon the
sea, watching the specks of sails that flashed upon the horizon,
while the evanescent expressions chased each other over his placid
face, as if it reflected the calm and changing sea before him. His
morning costume was an ample dressing-gown of gorgeously flowered
silk, and his morning was very apt to last all day.

“He rarely read, but he would pace the great piazza for hours, with
his hands sunken in the pockets of his dressing-gown, and an air of
sweet reverie, which any author might be very happy to produce.

“Society, of course, he saw little. There was some slight
apprehension that if he were bidden to social entertainments he
might forget his coat, or arrive without some other essential
part of his dress; and there is a sly tradition in the Titbottom
family that, having been invited to a ball in honor of the new
governor of the island, my grandfather Titbottom sauntered into
the hall towards midnight, wrapped in the gorgeous flowers of
his dressing-gown, and with his hands buried in the pockets,
as usual. There was great excitement, and immense deprecation
of gubernatorial ire. But it happened that the governor and my
grandfather were old friends, and there was no offense. But as
they were conversing together, one of the distressed managers cast
indignant glances at the brilliant costume of my grandfather, who
summoned him, and asked courteously:

“‘Did you invite me or my coat?’

“‘You, in a proper coat,’ replied the manager.

“The governor smiled approvingly, and looked at my grandfather.

“‘My friend,” said he to the manager, ‘I beg your pardon, I forgot.’

“The next day my grandfather was seen promenading in full ball
dress along the streets of the little town.

“‘They ought to know,’ said he, ‘that I have a proper coat, and
that not contempt nor poverty, but forgetfulness, sent me to a ball
in my dressing-gown.’

“He did not much frequent social festivals after this failure, but
he always told the story with satisfaction and a quiet smile.

“To a stranger, life upon those little islands is uniform even to
weariness. But the old native dons like my grandfather ripen in
the prolonged sunshine, like the turtle upon the Bahama banks, nor
know of existence more desirable. Life in the tropics I take to be
a placid torpidity. During the long, warm mornings of nearly half
a century, my grandfather Titbottom had sat in his dressing-gown
and gazed at the sea. But one calm June day, as he slowly paced the
piazza after breakfast, his dreamy glance was arrested by a little
vessel, evidently nearing the shore. He called for his spyglass,
and surveying the craft, saw that she came from the neighboring
island. She glided smoothly, slowly, over the summer sea. The warm
morning air was sweet with perfumes, and silent with heat. The
sea sparkled languidly, and the brilliant blue hung cloudlessly
over. Scores of little island vessels had my grandfather seen come
over the horizon, and cast anchor in the port. Hundreds of summer
mornings had the white sails flashed and faded, like vague faces
through forgotten dreams. But this time he laid down the spyglass,
and leaned against a column of the piazza, and watched the vessel
with an intentness that he could not explain. She came nearer and
nearer, a graceful spectre in the dazzling morning.

“‘Decidedly I must step down and see about that vessel,’ said my
grandfather Titbottom.

“He gathered his ample dressing-gown about him, and stepped from
the piazza with no other protection from the sun than the little
smoking cap upon his head. His face wore a calm, beaming smile, as
if he approved of all the world. He was not an old man, but there
was almost a patriarchal pathos in his expression as he sauntered
along in the sunshine towards the shore. A group of idle gazers was
collected to watch the arrival. The little vessel furled her sails
and drifted slowly landward, and as she was of very light draft,
she came close to the shelving shore. A long plank was put out from
her side, and the debarkation commenced. My grandfather Titbottom
stood looking on to see the passengers descend. There were but a
few of them, and mostly traders from the neighboring island. But
suddenly the face of a young girl appeared over the side of the
vessel, and she stepped upon the plank to descend. My grandfather
Titbottom instantly advanced, and moving briskly reached the top of
the plank at the same moment, and with the old tassel of his cap
flashing in the sun, and one hand in the pocket of his dressing
gown, with the other he handed the young lady carefully down the
plank. That young lady was afterwards my grandmother Titbottom.

“And so, over the gleaming sea which he had watched so long, and
which seemed thus to reward his patient gaze, came his bride that
sunny morning.

“‘Of course we are happy,’ he used to say: ‘For you are the gift
of the sun I have loved so long and so well.’ And my grandfather
Titbottom would lay his hand so tenderly upon the golden hair of
his young bride, that you could fancy him a devout Parsee caressing
sunbeams.

“There were endless festivities upon occasion of the marriage; and
my grandfather did not go to one of them in his dressing-gown.
The gentle sweetness of his wife melted every heart into love and
sympathy. He was much older than she, without doubt. But age, as he
used to say with a smile of immortal youth, is a matter of feeling,
not of years. And if, sometimes, as she sat by his side upon the
piazza, her fancy looked through her eyes upon that summer sea and
saw a younger lover, perhaps some one of those graceful and glowing
heroes who occupy the foreground of all young maidens’ visions by
the sea, yet she could not find one more generous and gracious, nor
fancy one more worthy and loving than my grandfather Titbottom.
And if in the moonlit midnight, while he lay calmly sleeping,
she leaned out of the window and sank into vague reveries of
sweet possibility, and watched the gleaming path of the moonlight
upon the water, until the dawn glided over it—it was only that
mood of nameless regret and longing, which underlies all human
happiness,—or it was the vision of that life of society, which she
had never seen, but of which she had often read, and which looked
very fair and alluring across the sea to a girlish imagination
which knew that it should never know that reality.

“These West Indian years were the great days of the family,” said
Titbottom, with an air of majestic and regal regret, pausing
and musing in our little parlor, like a late Stuart in exile,
remembering England. Prue raised her eyes from her work, and
looked at him with a subdued admiration; for I have observed that,
like the rest of her sex, she has a singular sympathy with the
representative of a reduced family. Perhaps it is their finer
perception which leads these tender-hearted women to recognize the
divine right of social superiority so much more readily than we;
and yet, much as Titbottom was enhanced in my wife’s admiration
by the discovery that his dusky sadness of nature and expression
was, as it were, the expiring gleam and late twilight of ancestral
splendors, I doubt if Mr. Bourne would have preferred him for
bookkeeper a moment sooner upon that account. In truth, I have
observed, down town, that the fact of your ancestors doing nothing
is not considered good proof that you can do anything. But Prue and
her sex regard sentiment more than action, and I understand easily
enough why she is never tired of hearing me read of Prince Charlie.
If Titbottom had been only a little younger, a little handsomer, a
little more gallantly dressed—in fact, a little more of the Prince
Charlie, I am sure her eyes would not have fallen again upon her
work so tranquilly, as he resumed his story.

“I can remember my grandfather Titbottom, although I was a very
young child, and he was a very old man. My young mother and
my young grandmother are very distinct figures in my memory,
ministering to the old gentleman, wrapped in his dressing-gown,
and seated upon the piazza. I remember his white hair and his calm
smile, and how, not long before he died, he called me to him, and
laying his hand upon my head, said to me:

“My child, the world is not this great sunny piazza, nor life the
fairy stories which the women tell you here as you sit in their
laps. I shall soon be gone, but I want to leave with you some
memento of my love for you, and I know nothing more valuable than
these spectacles, which your grandmother brought from her native
island, when she arrived here one fine summer morning, long ago. I
cannot quite tell whether, when you grow older, you will regard it
as a gift of the greatest value or as something that you had been
happier never to have possessed.’

“‘But grandpapa, I am not short-sighted.’

“‘My son, are you not human?’ said the old gentleman; and how shall
I ever forget the thoughtful sadness with which, at the same time
he handed me the spectacles.

“Instinctively I put them on, and looked at my grandfather. But
I saw no grandfather, no piazza, no flowered dressing-gown: I
saw only a luxuriant palm-tree, waving broadly over a tranquil
landscape. Pleasant homes clustered around it. Gardens teeming
with fruit and flowers; flocks quietly feeding; birds wheeling and
chirping. I heard children’s voices, and the low lullaby of happy
mothers. The sound of cheerful singing came wafted from distant
fields upon the light breeze. Golden harvests glistened out of
sight, and I caught their rustling whisper of prosperity. A warm,
mellow atmosphere bathed the whole. I have seen copies of the
landscapes of the Italian painter Claude which seemed to me faint
reminiscences of that calm and happy vision. But all this peace
and prosperity seemed to flow from the spreading palm as from a
fountain.

“I do not know how long I looked, but I had, apparently, no power,
as I had no will, to remove the spectacles. What a wonderful island
must Nevis be, thought I, if people carry such pictures in their
pockets, only by buying a pair of spectacles! What wonder that my
dear grandmother Titbottom has lived such a placid life, and has
blessed us all with her sunny temper, when she has lived surrounded
by such images of peace.

“My grandfather died. But still, in the warm morning sunshine upon
the piazza, I felt his placid presence, and as I crawled into his
great chair, and drifted on in reverie through the still, tropical
day, it was as if his soft, dreamy eye had passed into my soul.
My grandmother cherished his memory with tender regret. A violent
passion of grief for his loss was no more possible than for the
pensive decay of the year. We have no portrait of him, but I see
always, when I remember him, that peaceful and luxuriant palm. And
I think that to have known one good old man—one man who, through
the chances and rubs of a long life, has carried his heart in his
hand, like a palm branch, waving all discords into peace, helps
our faith in God, in ourselves, and in each other, more than many
sermons. I hardly know whether to be grateful to my grandfather for
the spectacles; and yet when I remember that it is to them I owe
the pleasant image of him which I cherish, I seem to myself sadly
ungrateful.

“Madam,” said Titbottom to Prue, solemnly, “my memory is a long and
gloomy gallery, and only remotely, at its further end, do I see the
glimmer of soft sunshine, and only there are the pleasant pictures
hung. They seem to me very happy along whose gallery the sunlight
streams to their very feet, striking all the pictured walls into
unfading splendor.”

Prue had laid her work in her lap, and as Titbottom paused a
moment, and I turned towards her, I found her mild eyes fastened
upon my face, and glistening with happy tears.

“Misfortunes of many kinds came heavily upon the family after the
head was gone. The great house was relinquished. My parents were
both dead, and my grandmother had entire charge of me. But from
the moment that I received the gift of the spectacles, I could not
resist their fascination, and I withdrew into myself, and became a
solitary boy. There were not many companions for me of my own age,
and they gradually left me, or, at least, had not a hearty sympathy
with me; for if they teased me I pulled out my spectacles and
surveyed them so seriously that they acquired a kind of awe of me,
and evidently regarded my grandfather’s gift as a concealed magical
weapon which might be dangerously drawn upon them at any moment.
Whenever, in our games, there were quarrels and high words, and I
began to feel about my dress and to wear a grave look, they all
took the alarm, and shouted, ‘Look out for Titbottom’s spectacles,’
and scattered like a flock of scared sheep.

“Nor could I wonder at it. For, at first, before they took the
alarm, I saw strange sights when I looked at them through the
glasses. If two were quarrelling about a marble or a ball, I had
only to go behind a tree where I was concealed and look at them
leisurely. Then the scene changed, and no longer a green meadow
with boys playing, but a spot which I did not recognize, and forms
that made me shudder or smile. It was not a big boy bullying a
little one, but a young wolf with glistening teeth and a lamb
cowering before him; or, it was a dog faithful and famishing—or
a star going slowly into eclipse—or a rainbow fading—or a flower
blooming—or a sun rising—or a waning moon. The revelations of the
spectacles determined my feeling for the boys, and for all whom
I saw through them. No shyness, nor awkwardness, nor silence,
could separate me from those who looked lovely as lilies to
my illuminated eyes. If I felt myself warmly drawn to any one
I struggled with the fierce desire of seeing him through the
spectacles. I longed to enjoy the luxury of ignorant feeling, to
love without knowing, to float like a leaf upon the eddies of
life, drifted now to a sunny point, now to a solemn shade—now over
glittering ripples, now over gleaming calms,—and not to determined
ports, a trim vessel with an inexorable rudder.

“But, sometimes, mastered after long struggles, I seized my
spectacles and sauntered into the little town. Putting them to my
eyes I peered into the houses and at the people who passed me. Here
sat a family at breakfast, and I stood at the window looking in. O
motley meal! fantastic vision! The good mother saw her lord sitting
opposite, a grave, respectable being, eating muffins. But I saw
only a bank-bill, more or less crumpled and tattered, marked with
a larger or lesser figure. If a sharp wind blew suddenly, I saw it
tremble and flutter; it was thin, flat, impalpable. I removed my
glasses, and looked with my eyes at the wife. I could have smiled
to see the humid tenderness with which she regarded her strange
_vis-à-vis_. Is life only a game of blind-man’s-buff? of droll
cross-purposes?

“Or I put them on again, and looked at the wife. How many stout
trees I saw,—how many tender flowers,—how many placid pools;
yes, and how many little streams winding out of sight, shrinking
before the large, hard, round eyes opposite, and slipping off
into solitude and shade, with a low, inner song for their own
solace. And in many houses I thought to see angels, nymphs, or at
least, women, and could only find broomsticks, mops, or kettles,
hurrying about, rattling, tinkling, in a state of shrill activity.
I made calls upon elegant ladies, and after I had enjoyed the
gloss of silk and the delicacy of lace, and the flash of jewels,
I slipped on my spectacles, and saw a peacock’s feather, flounced
and furbelowed and fluttering; or an iron rod, thin, sharp, and
hard; nor could I possibly mistake the movement of the drapery for
any flexibility of the thing draped,—or, mysteriously chilled, I
saw a statue of perfect form, or flowing movement, it might be
alabaster, or bronze, or marble,—but sadly often it was ice; and
I knew that after it had shone a little, and frozen a few eyes
with its despairing perfection, it could not be put away in the
niches of palaces for ornament and proud family tradition, like
the alabaster, or bronze, or marble statues, but would melt, and
shrink, and fall coldly away in colorless and useless water, be
absorbed in the earth and utterly forgotten.

“But the true sadness was rather in seeing those who, not having
the spectacles, thought that the iron rod was flexible, and the
ice statue warm. I saw many a gallant heart, which seemed to me
brave and loyal as the crusaders sent by genuine and noble faith to
Syria and the sepulchre, pursuing, through days and nights, and a
long life of devotion, the hope of lighting at least a smile in the
cold eyes, if not a fire in the icy heart. I watched the earnest,
enthusiastic sacrifice. I saw the pure resolve, the generous faith,
the fine scorn of doubt, the impatience of suspicion. I watched
the grace, the ardor, the glory of devotion. Through those strange
spectacles how often I saw the noblest heart renouncing all other
hope, all other ambition, all other life, than the possible love of
some one of those statues. Ah! me, it was terrible, but they had
not the love to give. The Parian face was so polished and smooth,
because there was no sorrow upon the heart,—and, drearily often,
no heart to be touched. I could not wonder that the noble heart of
devotion was broken, for it had dashed itself against a stone. I
wept, until my spectacles were dimmed for that hopeless sorrow; but
there was a pang beyond tears for those icy statues.

“Still a boy, I was thus too much a man in knowledge,—I did not
comprehend the sights I was compelled to see. I used to tear my
glasses away from my eyes, and, frightened at myself, run to escape
my own consciousness. Reaching the small house where we then lived,
I plunged into my grandmother’s room and, throwing myself upon
the floor, buried my face in her lap; and sobbed myself to sleep
with premature grief. But when I awakened, and felt her cool hand
upon my hot forehead, and heard the low, sweet song, or the gentle
story, or the tenderly told parable from the Bible, with which she
tried to soothe me, I could not resist the mystic fascination that
lured me, as I lay in her lap, to steal a glance at her through the
spectacles.

“Pictures of the Madonna have not her rare and pensive beauty. Upon
the tranquil little islands her life had been eventless, and all
the fine possibilities of her nature were like flowers that never
bloomed. Placid were all her years; yet I have read of no heroine,
of no woman great in sudden crises, that it did not seem to me she
might have been. The wife and widow of a man who loved his own home
better than the homes of others, I have yet heard of no queen,
no belle, no imperial beauty, whom in grace, and brilliancy, and
persuasive courtesy, she might not have surpassed.

“Madam,” said Titbottom to my wife, whose heart hung upon his
story; “your husband’s young friend, Aurelia, wears sometimes a
camelia in her hair, and no diamond in the ball-room seems so
costly as that perfect flower, which women envy, and for whose
least and withered petal men sigh; yet, in the tropical solitudes
of Brazil, how many a camelia bud drops from a bush that no eye
has ever seen, which, had it flowered and been noticed, would have
gilded all hearts with its memory.

“When I stole these furtive glances at my grandmother, half fearing
that they were wrong, I saw only a calm lake, whose shores were
low, and over which the sky hung unbroken, so that the least star
was clearly reflected. It had an atmosphere of solemn twilight
tranquillity, and so completely did its unruffled surface blend
with the cloudless, star-studded sky, that, when I looked through
my spectacles at my grandmother, the vision seemed to me all heaven
and stars. Yet, as I gazed and gazed, I felt what stately cities
might well have been built upon those shores, and have flashed
prosperity over the calm, like coruscations of pearls.

“I dreamed of gorgeous fleets, silken sailed and blown by perfumed
winds, drifting over those depthless waters and through those
spacious skies. I gazed upon the twilight, the inscrutable silence,
like a God-fearing discoverer upon a new, and vast, and dim sea,
bursting upon him through forest glooms, and in the fervor of whose
impassioned gaze, a millennial and poetic world arises, and man
need no longer die to be happy.

“My companions naturally deserted me, for I had grown wearily
grave and abstracted: and, unable to resist the allurement of
my spectacles, I was constantly lost in a world, of which those
companions were part, yet of which they knew nothing. I grew
cold and hard, almost morose; people seemed to me blind and
unreasonable. They did the wrong thing. They called green, yellow;
and black, white. Young men said of a girl, ‘What a lovely, simple
creature!’ I looked, and there was only a glistening wisp of
straw, dry and hollow. Or they said, ‘What a cold, proud beauty!’
I looked, and lo! a Madonna, whose heart held the world. Or they
said, ‘What a wild, giddy girl!’ and I saw a glancing, dancing
mountain stream, pure as the virgin snows whence it flowed, singing
through sun and shade, over pearls and gold dust, slipping along
unstained by weed, or rain, or heavy foot of cattle, touching the
flowers with a dewy kiss,—a beam of grace, a happy song, a line of
light, in the dim and troubled landscape.

“My grandmother sent me to school, but I looked at the master,
and saw that he was a smooth, round ferule—or an improper noun—or
a vulgar fraction, and refused to obey him. Or he was a piece of
string, a rag, a willow-wand, and I had a contemptuous pity. But
one was a well of cool, deep water, and looking suddenly in, one
day, I saw the stars. He gave me all my schooling. With him I used
to walk by the sea, and, as we strolled and the waves plunged in
long legions before us, I looked at him through the spectacles,
and as his eye dilated with the boundless view, and his chest
heaved with an impossible desire, I saw Xerxes and his army tossing
and glittering, rank upon rank, multitude upon multitude, out of
sight, but ever regularly advancing and with the confused roar of
ceaseless music, prostrating themselves in abject homage. Or, as
with arms outstretched and hair streaming on the wind, he chanted
full lines of the resounding Iliad, I saw Homer pacing the AEgean
sands in the Greek sunsets of forgotten times.

“My grandmother died, and I was thrown into the world without
resources, and with no capital but my spectacles. I tried to find
employment, but men were shy of me. There was a vague suspicion
that I was either a little crazed, or a good deal in league
with the Prince of Darkness. My companions who would persist in
calling a piece of painted muslin a fair and fragrant flower had
no difficulty; success waited for them around every corner, and
arrived in every ship. I tried to teach, for I loved children. But
if anything excited my suspicion, and, putting on my spectacles, I
saw that I was fondling a snake, or smelling at a bud with a worm
in it, I sprang up in horror and ran away; or, if it seemed to me
through the glasses that a cherub smiled upon me, or a rose was
blooming in my buttonhole, then I felt myself imperfect and impure,
not fit to be leading and training what was so essentially superior
in quality to myself, and I kissed the children and left them
weeping and wondering.

“In despair I went to a great merchant on the island, and asked him
to employ me.

“‘My young friend,’ said he, ‘I understand that you have some
singular secret, some charm, or spell, or gift, or something, I
don’t know what, of which people are afraid. Now, you know, my
dear,’ said the merchant, swelling up, and apparently prouder of
his great stomach than of his large fortune, ‘I am not of that
kind. I am not easily frightened. You may spare yourself the
pain of trying to impose upon me. People who propose to come to
time before I arrive, are accustomed to arise very early in the
morning,’ said he, thrusting his thumbs in the armholes of his
waistcoat, and spreading the fingers, like two fans, upon his
bosom. ‘I think I have heard something of your secret. You have a
pair of spectacles, I believe, that you value very much, because
your grandmother brought them as a marriage portion to your
grandfather. Now, if you think fit to sell me those spectacles, I
will pay you the largest market price for glasses. What do you say?’

“I told him that I had not the slightest idea of selling my
spectacles.

“‘My young friend means to eat them, I suppose,’ said he with a
contemptuous smile.

“I made no reply, but was turning to leave the office, when the
merchant called after me—

“‘My young friend, poor people should never suffer themselves to
get into pets. Anger is an expensive luxury, in which only men of a
certain income can indulge. A pair of spectacles and a hot temper
are not the most promising capital for success in life, Master
Titbottom.’

“I said nothing, but put my hand upon the door to go out, when the
merchant said more respectfully,—

“‘Well, you foolish boy, if you will not sell your spectacles,
perhaps you will agree to sell the use of them to me. That is, you
shall only put them on when I direct you, and for my purposes.
Hallo! you little fool!’ cried he impatiently, as he saw that I
intended to make no reply.

“But I had pulled out my spectacles, and put them on for my own
purpose, and against his direction and desire. I looked at him, and
saw a huge bald-headed wild boar, with gross chops and a leering
eye—only the more ridiculous for the high-arched, gold-bowed
spectacles, that straddled his nose. One of his fore hoofs was
thrust into the safe, where his bills payable were hived, and the
other into his pocket, among the loose change and bills there. His
ears were pricked forward with a brisk, sensitive smartness. In
a world where prize pork was the best excellence, he would have
carried off all the premiums.

“I stepped into the next office in the street, and a mild-faced,
genial man, also a large and opulent merchant, asked me my business
in such a tone, that I instantly looked through my spectacles,
and saw a land flowing with milk and honey. There I pitched my
tent, and stayed till the good man died, and his business was
discontinued.

“But while there,” said Titbottom, and his voice trembled away
into a sigh, “I first saw Preciosa. Spite of the spectacles, I
saw Preciosa. For days, for weeks, for months, I did not take
my spectacles with me. I ran away from them, I threw them up on
high shelves, I tried to make up my mind to throw them into the
sea, or down the well. I could not, I would not, I dared not look
at Preciosa through the spectacles. It was not possible for me
deliberately to destroy them; but I awoke in the night, and could
almost have cursed my dear old grandfather for his gift. I escaped
from the office, and sat for whole days with Preciosa. I told her
the strange things I had seen with my mystic glasses. The hours
were not enough for the wild romances which I raved in her ear.
She listened, astonished and appalled. Her blue eyes turned upon
me with a sweet deprecation. She clung to me, and then withdrew,
and fled fearfully from the room. But she could not stay away. She
could not resist my voice, in whose tones burned all the love that
filled my heart and brain. The very effort to resist the desire of
seeing her as I saw everybody else, gave a frenzy and an unnatural
tension to my feeling and my manner. I sat by her side, looking
into her eyes, smoothing her hair, folding her to my heart, which
was sunken and deep—why not forever?—in that dream of peace. I
ran from her presence, and shouted, and leaped with joy, and sat
the whole night through, thrilled into happiness by the thought
of her love and loveliness, like a wind-harp, tightly strung, and
answering the airiest sigh of the breeze with music. Then came
calmer days—the conviction of deep love settled upon our lives—as
after the hurrying, heaving days of spring, comes the bland and
benignant summer.

“‘It is no dream, then, after all, and we are happy,’ I said to
her, one day; and there came no answer, for happiness is speechless.

“We are happy then,” I said to myself, “there is no excitement now.
How glad I am that I can now look at her through my spectacles.”

“I feared lest some instinct should warn me to beware. I escaped
from her arms, and ran home and seized the glasses and bounded
back again to Preciosa. As I entered the room I was heated, my
head was swimming with confused apprehension, my eyes must have
glared. Preciosa was frightened, and rising from her seat, stood
with an inquiring glance of surprise in her eyes. But I was bent
with frenzy upon my purpose. I was merely aware that she was
in the room. I saw nothing else. I heard nothing. I cared for
nothing, but to see her through that magic glass, and feel at once,
all the fulness of blissful perfection which that would reveal.
Preciosa stood before the mirror, but alarmed at my wild and eager
movements, unable to distinguish what I had in my hands, and seeing
me raise them suddenly to my face, she shrieked with terror, and
fell fainting upon the floor, at the very moment that I placed the
glasses before my eyes, and beheld—myself, reflected in the mirror,
before which she had been standing.

“Dear madam,” cried Titbottom, to my wife, springing up and falling
back again in his chair, pale and trembling, while Prue ran to him
and took his hand, and I poured out a glass of water—“I saw myself.”

There was silence for many minutes. Prue laid her hand gently upon
the head of our guest, whose eyes were closed, and who breathed
softly, like an infant in sleeping. Perhaps, in all the long years
of anguish since that hour, no tender hand had touched his brow,
nor wiped away the damps of a bitter sorrow. Perhaps the tender,
maternal fingers of my wife soothed his weary head with the
conviction that he felt the hand of his mother playing with the
long hair of her boy in the soft West Indian morning. Perhaps it
was only the natural relief of expressing a pent-up sorrow. When
he spoke again, it was with the old, subdued tone, and the air of
quaint solemnity.

“These things were matters of long, long ago, and I came to this
country soon after. I brought with me, premature age, a past
of melancholy memories, and the magic spectacles. I had become
their slave. I had nothing more to fear. Having seen myself, I
was compelled to see others, properly to understand my relations
to them. The lights that cheer the future of other men had gone
out for me. My eyes were those of an exile turned backwards upon
the receding shore, and not forwards with hope upon the ocean. I
mingled with men, but with little pleasure. There are but many
varieties of a few types. I did not find those I came to clearer
sighted than those I had left behind. I heard men called shrewd and
wise, and report said they were highly intelligent and successful.
But when I looked at them through my glasses, I found no halo of
real manliness. My finest sense detected no aroma of purity and
principle; but I saw only a fungus that had fattened and spread in
a night. They all went to the theater to see actors upon the stage.
I went to see actors in the boxes, so consummately cunning, that
the others did not know they were acting, and they did not suspect
it themselves.

“Perhaps you wonder it did not make me misanthropical. My dear
friends, do not forget that I had seen myself. It made me
compassionate, not cynical. Of course I could not value highly
the ordinary standards of success and excellence. When I went to
church and saw a thin, blue, artificial flower, or a great sleepy
cushion expounding the beauty of holiness to pews full of eagles,
half-eagles, and threepences, however adroitly concealed in
broadcloth and boots: or saw an onion in an Easter bonnet weeping
over the sins of Magdalen, I did not feel as they felt who saw in
all this, not only propriety, but piety. Or when at public meetings
an eel stood up on end, and wriggled and squirmed lithely in every
direction, and declared that, for his part, he went in for rainbows
and hot water—how could I help seeing that he was still black and
loved a slimy pool?

“I could not grow misanthropical when I saw in the eyes of so
many who were called old, the gushing fountains of eternal youth,
and the light of an immortal dawn, or when I saw those who were
esteemed unsuccessful and aimless, ruling a fair realm of peace
and plenty, either in themselves, or more perfectly in another—a
realm and princely possession for which they had well renounced a
hopeless search and a belated triumph. I knew one man who had been
for years a by-word for having sought the philosopher’s stone. But
I looked at him through the spectacles and saw a satisfaction in
concentrated energies, and a tenacity arising from devotion to a
noble dream, which was not apparent in the youths who pitied him in
the aimless effeminacy of clubs, nor in the clever gentlemen who
cracked their thin jokes upon him over a gossiping dinner.

“And there was your neighbor over the way, who passes for a woman
who has failed in her career, because she is an old maid. People
wag solemn heads of pity, and say that she made so great a mistake
in not marrying the brilliant and famous man who was for long years
her suitor. It is clear that no orange flower will ever bloom
for her. The young people make tender romances about her as they
watch her, and think of her solitary hours of bitter regret, and
wasting longing, never to be satisfied. When I first came to town
I shared this sympathy, and pleased my imagination with fancying
her hard struggle with the conviction that she had lost all that
made life beautiful. I supposed that if I looked at her through
my spectacles, I should see that it was only her radiant temper
which so illuminated her dress, that we did not see it to be heavy
sables. But when, one day, I did raise my glasses and glanced at
her, I did not see the old maid whom we all pitied for a secret
sorrow, but a woman whose nature was a tropic, in which the sun
shone, and birds sang, and flowers bloomed forever. There were
no regrets, no doubts and half wishes, but a calm sweetness, a
transparent peace. I saw her blush when that old lover passed by,
or paused to speak to her, but it was only the sign of delicate
feminine consciousness. She knew his love, and honored it, although
she could not understand it nor return it. I looked closely at
her, and I saw that although all the world had exclaimed at her
indifference to such homage, and had declared it was astonishing
she should lose so fine a match, she would only say simply and
quietly—

“‘If Shakespeare loved me and I did not love him, how could I marry
him?’

“Could I be misanthropical when I saw such fidelity, and dignity,
and simplicity?

“You may believe that I was especially curious to look at that old
lover of hers, through my glasses. He was no longer young, you
know, when I came, and his fame and fortune were secure. Certainly
I have heard of few men more beloved, and of none more worthy
to be loved. He had the easy manner of a man of the world, the
sensitive grace of a poet, and the charitable judgment of a wide
traveller. He was accounted the most successful and most unspoiled
of men. Handsome, brilliant, wise, tender, graceful, accomplished,
rich, and famous, I looked at him, without the spectacles, in
surprise, and admiration, and wondered how your neighbor over the
way had been so entirely untouched by his homage. I watched their
intercourse in society, I saw her gay smile, her cordial greeting;
I marked his frank address, his lofty courtesy. Their manner
told no tales. The eager world was balked, and I pulled out my
spectacles.

“I had seen her, already, and now I saw him. He lived only in
memory, and his memory was a spacious and stately palace. But he
did not oftenest frequent the banqueting hall, where were endless
hospitality and feasting—nor did he loiter much in reception rooms,
where a throng of new visitors was forever swarming—nor did he
feed his vanity by haunting the apartment in which were stored
the trophies of his varied triumphs—nor dream much in the great
gallery hung with pictures of his travels. But from all these lofty
halls of memory he constantly escaped to a remote and solitary
chamber, into which no one had ever penetrated. But my fatal
eyes, behind the glasses, followed and entered with him, and saw
that the chamber was a chapel. It was dim, and silent, and sweet
with perpetual incense that burned upon an altar before a picture
forever veiled. There, whenever I chanced to look, I saw him kneel
and pray; and there, by day and by night, a funeral hymn was
chanted.

“I do not believe you will be surprised that I have been content
to remain deputy bookkeeper. My spectacles regulated my ambition,
and I early learned that there were better gods than Plutus. The
glasses have lost much of their fascination now, and I do not often
use them. Sometimes the desire is irresistible. Whenever I am
greatly interested, I am compelled to take them out and see what it
is that I admire.

“And yet—and yet,” said Titbottom, after a pause, “I am not sure
that I thank my grandfather.”

Prue had long since laid away her work, and had heard every word of
the story. I saw that the dear woman had yet one question to ask,
and had been earnestly hoping to hear something that would spare
her the necessity of asking. But Titbottom had resumed his usual
tone, after the momentary excitement, and made no further allusion
to himself. We all sat silently; Titbottom’s eyes fastened musingly
upon the carpet: Prue looking wistfully at him, and I regarding
both.

It was past midnight, and our guest arose to go. He shook hands
quietly, made his grave Spanish bow to Prue, and taking his hat,
went towards the front door. Prue and I accompanied him. I saw in
her eyes that she would ask her question. And as Titbottom opened
the door, I heard the low words:

“And Preciosa?”

Titbottom paused. He had just opened the door and the moonlight
streamed over him as he stood, turning back to us.

“I have seen her but once since. It was in church, and she was
kneeling with her eyes closed, so that she did not see me. But I
rubbed the glasses well, and looked at her, and saw a white lily,
whose stem was broken, but which was fresh; and luminous, and
fragrant, still.”

“That was a miracle,” interrupted Prue.

“Madam, it was a miracle,” replied Titbottom, “and for that one
sight I am devoutly grateful for my grandfather’s gift. I saw, that
although a flower may have lost its hold upon earthly moisture, it
may still bloom as sweetly, fed by the dews of heaven.”

The door closed, and he was gone. But as Prue put her arm in mine
and we went upstairs together, she whispered in my ear:

“How glad I am that you don’t wear spectacles.”

MY DOUBLE; AND HOW HE UNDID ME[15]

By Edward Everett Hale (1822–1909)


It is not often that I trouble the readers of _The Atlantic
Monthly_. I should not trouble them now, but for the importunities
of my wife, who “feels to insist” that a duty to society is
unfulfilled, till I have told why I had to have a double, and
how he undid me. She is sure, she says, that intelligent persons
cannot understand that pressure upon public servants which alone
drives any man into the employment of a double. And while I fear
she thinks, at the bottom of her heart, that my fortunes will never
be re-made, she has a faint hope, that, as another Rasselas, I
may teach a lesson to future publics, from which they may profit,
though we die. Owing to the behavior of my double, or, if you
please, to that public pressure which compelled me to employ him, I
have plenty of leisure to write this communication.

I am, or rather was, a minister, of the Sandemanian connection. I
was settled in the active, wide-awake town of Naguadavick, on one
of the finest water-powers in Maine. We used to call it a Western
town in the heart of the civilization of New England. A charming
place it was and is. A spirited, brave young parish had I; and it
seemed as if we might have all “the joy of eventful living” to our
hearts’ content.

Alas! how little we knew on the day of my ordination, and in those
halcyon moments of our first housekeeping! To be the confidential
friend in a hundred families in the town—cutting the social trifle,
as my friend Haliburton says, “from the top of the whipped-syllabub
to the bottom of the sponge-cake, which is the foundation”—to keep
abreast of the thought of the age in one’s study, and to do one’s
best on Sunday to interweave that thought with the active life of
an active town, and to inspirit both and make both infinite by
glimpses of the Eternal Glory, seemed such an exquisite forelook
into one’s life! Enough to do, and all so real and so grand! If
this vision could only have lasted.

The truth is, that this vision was not in itself a delusion, nor,
indeed, half bright enough. If one could only have been left to
do his own business, the vision would have accomplished itself
and brought out new paraheliacal visions, each as bright as the
original. The misery was and is, as we found out, I and Polly,
before long, that, besides the vision, and besides the usual human
and finite failures in life (such as breaking the old pitcher
that came over in the Mayflower, and putting into the fire the
alpenstock with which her father climbed Mont Blanc)—besides,
these, I say (imitating the style of Robinson Crusoe), there
were pitchforked in on us a great rowen-heap of humbugs, handed
down from some unknown seed-time, in which we were expected,
and I chiefly, to fulfil certain public functions before the
community, of the character of those fulfilled by the third row
of supernumeraries who stand behind the Sepoys in the spectacle
of the _Cataract of the Ganges_. They were the duties, in a word,
which one performs as member of one or another social class or
subdivision, wholly distinct from what one does as A. by himself A.
What invisible power put these functions on me, it would be very
hard to tell. But such power there was and is. And I had not been
at work a year before I found I was living two lives, one real and
one merely functional—for two sets of people, one my parish, whom
I loved, and the other a vague public, for whom I did not care two
straws. All this was in a vague notion, which everybody had and
has, that this second life would eventually bring out some great
results, unknown at present, to somebody somewhere.

Crazed by this duality of life, I first read Dr. Wigan on the
_Duality of the Brain_, hoping that I could train one side of my
head to do these outside jobs, and the other to do my intimate and
real duties. For Richard Greenough once told me that, in studying
for the statue of Franklin, he found that the left side of the
great man’s face was philosophic and reflective, and the right side
funny and smiling. If you will go and look at the bronze statue,
you will find he has repeated this observation there for posterity.
The eastern profile is the portrait of the statesman Franklin,
the western of Poor Richard. But Dr. Wigan does not go into these
niceties of this subject, and I failed. It was then that, on my
wife’s suggestion, I resolved to look out for a Double.

I was, at first, singularly successful. We happened to be
recreating at Stafford Springs that summer. We rode out one day,
for one of the relaxations of that watering-place, to the great
Monsonpon House. We were passing through one of the large halls,
when my destiny was fulfilled! I saw my man!

He was not shaven. He had on no spectacles. He was dressed in a
green baize roundabout and faded blue overalls, worn sadly at
the knee. But I saw at once that he was of my height, five feet
four and a half. He had black hair, worn off by his hat. So have
and have not I. He stooped in walking. So do I. His hands were
large, and mine. And—choicest gift of Fate in all—he had, not
“a strawberry-mark on his left arm,” but a cut from a juvenile
brickbat over his right eye, slightly affecting the play of that
eyebrow. Reader, so have I!—My fate was sealed!

A word with Mr. Holley, one of the inspectors, settled the whole
thing. It proved that this Dennis Shea was a harmless, amiable
fellow, of the class known as shiftless, who had sealed his
fate by marrying a dumb wife, who was at that moment ironing in
the laundry. Before I left Stafford, I had hired both for five
years. We had applied to Judge Pynchon, then the probate judge at
Springfield, to change the name of Dennis Shea to Frederic Ingham.
We had explained to the Judge, what was the precise truth, that
an eccentric gentleman wished to adopt Dennis under this new name
into his family. It never occurred to him that Dennis might be more
than fourteen years old. And thus, to shorten this preface, when
we returned at night to my parsonage at Naguadavick, there entered
Mrs. Ingham, her new dumb laundress, myself, who am Mr. Frederic
Ingham, and my double, who was Mr. Frederic Ingham by as good right
as I.

Oh, the fun we had the next morning in shaving his beard to my
pattern, cutting his hair to match mine, and teaching him how to
wear and how to take off gold-bowed spectacles! Really, they were
electroplate, and the glass was plain (for the poor fellow’s eyes
were excellent). Then in four successive afternoons I taught him
four speeches. I had found these would be quite enough for the
supernumerary-Sepoy line of life, and it was well for me they were.
For though he was good-natured, he was very shiftless, and it was,
as our national proverb says, “like pulling teeth” to teach him.
But at the end of the next week he could say, with quite my easy
and frisky air:

1. “Very well, thank you. And you?” This for an answer to casual
salutations.

2. “I am very glad you liked it.”

3. “There has been so much said, and, on the whole, so well said,
that I will not occupy the time.”

4. “I agree, in general, with my friend on the other side of the
room.”

At first I had a feeling that I was going to be at great cost for
clothing him. But it proved, of course, at once, that, whenever he
was out, I should be at home. And I went, during the bright period
of his success, to so few of those awful pageants which require a
black dress-coat and what the ungodly call, after Mr. Dickens, a
white choker, that in the happy retreat of my own dressing-gowns
and jackets my days went by as happily and cheaply as those of
another Thalaba. And Polly declares there was never a year when
the tailoring cost so little. He lived (Dennis, not Thalaba) in
his wife’s room over the kitchen. He had orders never to show
himself at that window. When he appeared in the front of the house,
I retired to my sanctissimum and my dressing-gown. In short, the
Dutchman and, his wife, in the old weather-box, had not less to do
with, each other than he and I. He made the furnace-fire and split
the wood before daylight; then he went to sleep again, and slept
late; then came for orders, with a red silk bandanna tied round
his head, with his overalls on, and his dress-coat and spectacles
off. If we happened to be interrupted, no one guessed that he was
Frederic Ingham as well as I; and, in the neighborhood, there grew
up an impression that the minister’s Irishman worked day-times in
the factory village at New Coventry. After I had given him his
orders, I never saw him till the next day.

I launched him by sending him to a meeting of the Enlightenment
Board. The Enlightenment Board consists of seventy-four members,
of whom sixty-seven are necessary to form a quorum. One becomes a
member under the regulations laid down in old Judge Dudley’s will.
I became one by being ordained pastor of a church in Naguadavick.
You see you cannot help yourself, if you would. At this particular
time we had had four successive meetings, averaging four hours
each—wholly occupied in whipping in a quorum. At the first only
eleven men were present; at the next, by force of three circulars,
twenty-seven; at the third, thanks to two days’ canvassing by
Auchmuty and myself, begging men to come, we had sixty. Half the
others were in Europe. But without a quorum we could do nothing.
All the rest of us waited grimly for our four hours, and adjourned
without any action. At the fourth meeting we had flagged, and
only got fifty-nine together. But on the first appearance of my
double—whom I sent on this fatal Monday to the fifth meeting—he was
the _sixty-seventh_ man who entered the room. He was greeted with
a storm of applause! The poor fellow had missed his way—read the
street signs ill through his spectacles (very ill, in fact, without
them)—and had not dared to inquire. He entered the room—finding
the president and secretary holding to their chairs two judges
of the Supreme Court, who were also members _ex officio_, and
were begging leave to go away. On his entrance all was changed.
_Presto_, the by-laws were amended, and the Western property was
given away. Nobody stopped to converse with him. He voted, as I
had charged him to do, in every instance, with the minority. I
won new laurels as a man of sense, though a little unpunctual—and
Dennis, _alias_ Ingham, returned to the parsonage, astonished to
see with how little wisdom the world is governed. He cut a few of
my parishioners in the street; but he had his glasses off, and I am
known to be nearsighted. Eventually he recognized them more readily
than I.

I “set him again” at the exhibition of the New Coventry Academy;
and here he undertook a “speaking part”—as, in my boyish, worldly
days, I remember the bills used to say of Mlle. Celeste. We are all
trustees of the New Coventry Academy; and there has lately been
“a good deal of feeling” because the Sandemanian trustees did not
regularly attend the exhibitions. It has been intimated, indeed,
that the Sandemanians are leaning towards Free-Will, and that we
have, therefore, neglected these semi-annual exhibitions, while
there is no doubt that Auchmuty last year went to Commencement at
Waterville. Now the head master at New Coventry is a real good
fellow, who knows a Sanskrit root when he sees it, and often cracks
etymologies with me—so that, in strictness, I ought to go to their
exhibitions. But think, reader, of sitting through three long July
days in that Academy chapel, following the program from

    TUESDAY MORNING. ENGLISH COMPOSITION. Sunshine. Miss Jones,

round to

    Trio on Three Pianos. Duel from opera of Midshipman Easy.
    MARRYATT.

coming in at nine, Thursday evening! Think of this, reader, for
men who know the world is trying to go backward, and who would
give their lives if they could help it on! Well! The double had
succeeded so well at the Board, that I sent him to the Academy.
(Shade of Plato, pardon!) He arrived early on Tuesday, when,
indeed, few but mothers and clergymen are generally expected, and
returned in the evening to us, covered with honors. He had dined
at the right hand of the chairman, and he spoke in high terms of
the repast. The chairman had expressed his interest in the French
conversation. “I am very glad you liked it,” said Dennis; and the
poor chairman, abashed, supposed the accent had been wrong. At
the end of the day, the gentlemen present had been called upon
for speeches—the Rev. Frederic Ingham first, as it happened; upon
which Dennis had risen, and had said, “There has been so much
said, and, on the whole, so well said, that I will not occupy the
time.” The girls were delighted, because Dr. Dabney, the year
before, had given them at this occasion a scolding on impropriety
of behavior at lyceum lectures. They all declared Mr. Ingham was a
love—and _so_ handsome! (Dennis is good-looking.) Three of them,
with arms behind the others’ waists, followed him up to the wagon
he rode home in; and a little girl with a blue sash had been sent
to give him a rosebud. After this debut in speaking, he went to
the exhibition for two days more, to the mutual satisfaction of
all concerned. Indeed, Polly reported that he had pronounced the
trustees’ dinners of a higher grade than those of the parsonage.
When the next term began, I found six of the Academy girls had
obtained permission to come across the river and attend our church.
But this arrangement did not long continue.

After this he went to several Commencements for me, and ate the
dinners provided; he sat through three of our Quarterly Conventions
for me—always voting judiciously, by the simple rule mentioned
above, of siding with the minority. And I, meanwhile, who had
before been losing caste among my friends, as holding myself aloof
from the associations of the body, began to rise in everybody’s
favor. “Ingham’s a good fellow—always on hand”; “never talks
much—but does the right thing at the right time”; “is not as
unpunctual as he used to be—he comes early, and sits through to the
end.” “He has got over his old talkative habit, too. I spoke to a
friend of his about it once; and I think Ingham took it kindly,”
etc., etc.

This voting power of Dennis was particularly valuable at the
quarterly meetings of the Proprietors of the Naguadavick Ferry.
My wife inherited from her father some shares in that enterprise,
which is not yet fully developed, though it doubtless will become a
very valuable property. The law of Maine then forbade stockholders
to appear by proxy at such meetings. Polly disliked to go, not
being, in fact, a “hens’-rights hen,” and transferred her stock to
me. I, after going once, disliked it more than she. But Dennis went
to the next meeting, and liked it very much. He said the armchairs
were good, the collation good, and the free rides to stockholders
pleasant. He was a little frightened when they first took him upon
one of the ferry-boats, but after two or three quarterly meetings
he became quite brave.

Thus far I never had any difficulty with him. Indeed, being of
that type which is called shiftless, he was only too happy to be
told daily what to do, and to be charged not to be forthputting
or in any way original in his discharge of that duty. He learned,
however, to discriminate between the lines of his life, and very
much preferred these stockholders’ meetings and trustees’ dinners
and commencement collations to another set of occasions, from
which he used to beg off most piteously. Our excellent brother,
Dr. Fillmore, had taken a notion at this time that our Sandemanian
churches needed more expression of mutual sympathy. He insisted
upon it that we were remiss. He said, that, if the Bishop came to
preach at Naguadavick, all the Episcopal clergy of the neighborhood
were present; if Dr. Pond came, all the Congregational clergymen
turned out to hear him; if Dr. Nichols, all the Unitarians; and
he thought we owed it to each other that, whenever there was an
occasional service at a Sandemanian church, the other brethren
should all, if possible, attend. “It looked well,” if nothing
more. Now this really meant that I had not been to hear one of Dr.
Fillmore’s lectures on the Ethnology of Religion. He forgot that
he did not hear one of my course on the Sandemanianism of Anselm.
But I felt badly when he said it; and afterwards I always made
Dennis go to hear all the brethren preach, when I was not preaching
myself. This was what he took exceptions to—the only thing, as I
said, which he ever did except to. Now came the advantage of his
long morning-nap, and of the green tea with which Polly supplied
the kitchen. But he would plead, so humbly, to be let off, only
from one or two! I never excepted him, however. I knew the lectures
were of value, and I thought it best he should be able to keep the
connection.

Polly is more rash than I am, as the reader has observed in the
outset of this memoir. She risked Dennis one night under the
eyes of her own sex. Governor Gorges had always been very kind
to us; and when he gave his great annual party to the town,
asked us. I confess I hated to go. I was deep in the new volume
of Pfeiffer’s _Mystics_, which Haliburton had just sent me from
Boston. “But how rude,” said Polly, “not to return the Governor’s
civility and Mrs. Gorges’s, when they will be sure to ask why you
are away!” Still I demurred, and at last she, with the wit of
Eve and of Semiramis conjoined, let me off by saying that, if I
would go in with her, and sustain the initial conversations with
the Governor and the ladies staying there, she would risk Dennis
for the rest of the evening. And that was just what we did. She
took Dennis in training all that afternoon, instructed him in
fashionable conversation, cautioned him against the temptations
of the supper-table—and at nine in the evening he drove us all
down in the carryall. I made the grand star-entrée with Polly and
the pretty Walton girls, who were staying with us. We had put
Dennis into a great rough top-coat, without his glasses—and the
girls never dreamed, in the darkness, of looking at him. He sat in
the carriage, at the door, while we entered. I did the agreeable
to Mrs. Gorges, was introduced to her niece. Miss Fernanda—I
complimented Judge Jeffries on his decision in the great case of
D’Aulnay _vs._ Laconia Mining Co.—I stepped into the dressing-room
for a moment—stepped out for another—walked home, after a nod with
Dennis, and tying the horse to a pump—and while I walked home, Mr.
Frederic Ingham, my double, stepped in through the library into the
Gorges’s grand saloon.

Oh! Polly died of laughing as she told me of it at midnight! And
even here, where I have to teach my hands to hew the beech for
stakes to fence our cave, she dies of laughing as she recalls
it—and says that single occasion was worth all we have paid for it.
Gallant Eve that she is! She joined Dennis at the library door,
and in an instant presented him to Dr. Ochterlong, from Baltimore,
who was on a visit in town, and was talking with her, as Dennis
came in. “Mr. Ingham would like to hear what you were telling us
about your success among the German population.” And Dennis bowed
and said, in spite of a scowl from Polly, “I’m very glad you liked
it.” But Dr. Ochterlong did not observe, and plunged into the tide
of explanation, Dennis listening like a prime-minister, and bowing
like a mandarin—which is, I suppose, the same thing. Polly declared
it was just like Haliburton’s Latin conversation with the Hungarian
minister, of which he is very fond of telling. “_Quoene sit
historia Reformationis in Ungariâ?_” quoth Haliburton, after some
thought. And his _confrère_ replied gallantly, “_In seculo decimo
tertio_,” etc., etc., etc.; and from _decimo tertio_[16] to the
nineteenth century and a half lasted till the oysters came. So was
it that before Dr. Ochterlong came to the “success,” or near it,
Governor Gorges came to Dennis and asked him to hand Mrs. Jeffries
down to supper, a request which he heard with great joy.

Polly was skipping round the room, I guess, gay as a lark.
Auchmuty came to her “in pity for poor Ingham,” who was so bored
by the stupid pundit—and Auchmuty could not understand why I
stood it so long. But when Dennis took Mrs. Jeffries down, Polly
could not resist standing near them. He was a little flustered,
till the sight of the eatables and drinkables gave him the same
Mercian courage which it gave Diggory. A little excited then, he
attempted one or two of his speeches to the Judge’s lady. But
little he knew how hard it was to get in even a _promptu_ there
edgewise. “Very well, I thank you,” said he, after the eating
elements were adjusted; “and you?” And then did not he have to
hear about the mumps, and the measles, and arnica, and belladonna,
and chamomile-flower, and dodecathem, till she changed oysters
for salad—and then about the old practice and the new, and what
her sister said, and what her sister’s friend said, and what the
physician to her sister’s friend said, and then what was said
by the brother of the sister of the physician of the friend of
her sister, exactly as if it had been in Ollendorff? There was a
moment’s pause, as she declined champagne. “I am very glad you
liked it,” said Dennis again, which he never should have said,
but to one who complimented a sermon. “Oh! you are so sharp, Mr.
Ingham! No! I never drink any wine at all—except sometimes in
summer a little currant spirits—from our own currants, you know.
My own mother—that is, I call her my own mother, because, you
know, I do not remember,” etc., etc., etc.; till they came to
the candied orange at the end of the feast—when Dennis, rather
confused, thought he must say something, and tried No. 4—“I agree,
in general, with my friend the other side of the room”—which he
never should have said but at a public meeting. But Mrs. Jeffries,
who never listens expecting to understand, caught him up instantly
with, “Well, I’m sure my husband returns the compliment; he always
agrees with you—though we do worship with the Methodists—but
you know, Mr. Ingham,” etc., etc., etc., till the move was made
upstairs; and as Dennis led her through the hall, he was scarcely
understood by any but Polly, as he said, “There has been so much
said, and, on the whole, so well said, that I will not occupy the
time.”

His great resource the rest of the evening was standing in the
library, carrying on animated conversations with one and another
in much the same way. Polly had initiated him in the mysteries
of a discovery of mine, that it is not necessary to finish your
sentence in a crowd, but by a sort of mumble, omitting sibilants
and dentals. This, indeed, if your words fail you, answers even in
public extempore speech—but better where other talking is going
on. Thus: “We missed you at the Natural History Society, Ingham.”
Ingham replies: “I am very gligloglum, that is, that you were
m-m-m-m-m.” By gradually dropping the voice, the interlocutor is
compelled to supply the answer. “Mrs. Ingham, I hope your friend
Augusta is better.” Augusta has not been ill. Polly cannot think
of explaining, however, and answers: “Thank you, ma’am; she is
very rearason wewahwewob,” in lower and lower tones. And Mrs.
Throckmorton, who forgot the subject of which she spoke, as soon
as she asked the question, is quite satisfied. Dennis could see
into the card-room, and came to Polly to ask if he might not go and
play all-fours. But, of course, she sternly refused. At midnight
they came home delightedly: Polly, as I said, wild to tell me the
story of victory; only both the pretty Walton girls said: “Cousin
Frederic, you did not come near me all the evening.”

We always called him Dennis at home, for convenience, though his
real name was Frederic Ingham, as I have explained. When the
election day came round, however, I found that by some accident
there was only one Frederic Ingham’s name on the voting-list; and,
as I was quite busy that day in writing some foreign letters to
Halle, I thought I would forego my privilege of suffrage, and stay
quietly at home, telling Dennis that he might use the record on
the voting-list and vote. I gave him a ticket, which I told him he
might use, if he liked to. That was that very sharp election in
Maine which the readers of _The Atlantic_ so well remember, and it
had been intimated in public that the ministers would do well not
to appear at the polls. Of course, after that, we had to appear by
self or proxy. Still, Naguadavick was not then a city, and this
standing in a double queue at townmeeting several hours to vote was
a bore of the first water; and so, when I found that there was but
one Frederic Ingham on the list, and that one of us must give up,
I stayed at home and finished the letters (which, indeed, procured
for Fothergill his coveted appointment of Professor of Astronomy
at Leavenworth), and I gave Dennis, as we called him, the chance.
Something in the matter gave a good deal of popularity to the
Frederic Ingham name; and at the adjourned election, next week,
Frederic Ingham was chosen to the legislature. Whether this was I
or Dennis, I never really knew. My friends seemed to think it was
I; but I felt, that, as Dennis had done the popular thing, he was
entitled to the honor; so I sent him to Augusta when the time came,
and he took the oaths. And a very valuable member he made. They
appointed him on the Committee on Parishes; but I wrote a letter
for him, resigning, on the ground that he took an interest in our
claim to the stumpage in the minister’s sixteenths of Gore A, next
No. 7, in the 10th Range. He never made any speeches, and always
voted with the minority, which was what he was sent to do. He made
me and himself a great many good friends, some of whom I did not
afterwards recognize as quickly as Dennis did my parishioners. On
one or two occasions, when there was wood to saw at home, I kept
him at home; but I took those occasions to go to Augusta myself.
Finding myself often in his vacant seat at these times, I watched
the proceedings with a good deal of care; and once was so much
excited that I delivered my somewhat celebrated speech on the
Central School District question, a speech of which the State of
Maine printed some extra copies. I believe there is no formal rule
permitting strangers to speak; but no one objected.

Dennis himself, as I said, never spoke at all. But our experience
this session led me to think, that if, by some such “general
understanding” as the reports speak of in legislation daily, every
member of Congress might leave a double to sit through those
deadly sessions and answer to roll-calls and do the legitimate
party-voting, which appears stereotyped in the regular list of
Ashe, Bocock, Black, etc., we should gain decidedly in working
power. As things stand, the saddest state prison I ever visit is
that Representatives’ Chamber in Washington. If a man leaves for
an hour, twenty “correspondents” may be howling, “Where was Mr.
Prendergast when the Oregon bill passed?” And if poor Prendergast
stays there! Certainly, the worst use you can make of a man is to
put him in prison!

I know, indeed, that public men of the highest rank have resorted
to this expedient long ago. Dumas’s novel of _The Iron Mask_ turns
on the brutal imprisonment of Louis the Fourteenth’s double. There
seems little doubt, in our own history, that it was the real
General Pierce who shed tears when the delegate from Lawrence
explained to him the sufferings of the people there—and only
General Pierce’s double who had given the orders for the assault
on that town, which was invaded the next day. My charming friend,
George Withers, has, I am almost sure, a double, who preaches his
afternoon sermons for him. This is the reason that the theology
often varies so from that of the forenoon. But that double is
almost as charming as the original. Some of the most well-defined
men, who stand out most prominently on the background of history,
are in this way stereoscopic men; who owe their distinct relief to
the slight differences between the doubles. All this I know. My
present suggestion is simply the great extension of the system, so
that all public machine-work may be done by it.

But I see I loiter on my story, which is rushing to the plunge.
Let me stop an instant more, however, to recall, were it only
to myself, that charming year while all was yet well. After the
double had become a matter of course, for nearly twelve months
before he undid me, what a year it was! Full of active life, full
of happy love, of the hardest work, of the sweetest sleep, and
the fulfilment of so many of the fresh aspirations and dreams of
boyhood! Dennis went to every school-committee meeting, and sat
through all those late wranglings which used to keep me up till
midnight and awake till morning. He attended all the lectures to
which foreign exiles sent me tickets begging me to come for the
love of Heaven and of Bohemia. He accepted and used all the tickets
for charity concerts which were sent to me. He appeared everywhere
where it was specially desirable that “our denomination,” or
“our party,” or “our class,” or “our family,” or “our street,”
or “our town,” or “our country,” or “our state,” should be fully
represented. And I fell back to that charming life which in
boyhood one dreams of, when he supposes he shall do his own duty
and make his own sacrifices, without being tied up with those of
other people. My rusty Sanskrit, Arabic, Hebrew, Greek, Latin,
French, Italian, Spanish, German and English began to take polish.
Heavens! how little I had done with them while I attended to my
_public_ duties! My calls on my parishioners became the friendly,
frequent, homelike sociabilities they were meant to be, instead
of the hard work of a man goaded to desperation by the sight of
his lists of arrears. And preaching! what a luxury preaching was
when I had on Sunday the whole result of an individual, personal
week, from which to speak to a people whom all that week I had been
meeting as hand-to-hand friend! I never tired on Sunday, and was
in condition to leave the sermon at home, if I chose, and preach
it extempore, as all men should do always. Indeed, I wonder, when
I think that a sensible people like ours—really more attached to
their clergy than they were in the lost days, when the Mathers and
Nortons were noblemen—should choose to neutralize so much of their
ministers’ lives, and destroy so much of their early training,
by this undefined passion for seeing them in public. It springs
from our balancing of sects. If a spirited Episcopalian takes an
interest in the almshouse, and is put on the Poor Board, every
other denomination must have a minister there, lest the poorhouse
be changed into St. Paul’s Cathedral. If a Sandemanian is chosen
president of the Young Men’s Library, there must be a Methodist
vice-president and a Baptist secretary. And if a Universalist
Sunday-School Convention collects five hundred delegates, the next
Congregationalist Sabbath-School Conference must be as large, “lest
‘they’—whoever _they_ may be—should think ‘we’—whoever _we_ may
be—are going down.”

Freed from these necessities, that happy year, I began to know my
wife by sight. We saw each other sometimes. In those long mornings,
when Dennis was in the study explaining to map-peddlers that I
had eleven maps of Jerusalem already, and to school-book agents
that I would see them hanged before I would be bribed to introduce
their textbooks into the schools—she and I were at work together,
as in those old dreamy days—and in these of our log-cabin again.
But all this could not last—and at length poor Dennis, my double,
overtasked in turn, undid me.

It was thus it happened. There is an excellent fellow—once a
minister—I will call him Isaacs—who deserves well of the world
till he dies, and after—because he once, in a real exigency, did
the right thing, in the right way, at the right time, as no other
man could do it. In the world’s great football match, the ball by
chance found him loitering on the outside of the field; he closed
with it, “camped” it, charged, it home—yes, right through the
other side—not disturbed, not frightened by his own success—and
breathless found himself a great man—as the Great Delta rang
applause. But he did not find himself a rich man; and the football
has never come in his way again. From that moment to this moment he
has been of no use, that one can see, at all. Still, for that great
act we speak of Isaacs gratefully and remember him kindly; and he
forges on, hoping to meet the football somewhere again. In that
vague hope, he had arranged a “movement” for a general organization
of the human family into Debating Clubs, County Societies, State
Unions, etc., etc., with a view of inducing all children to take
hold of the handles of their knives and forks, instead of the
metal. Children have bad habits in that way. The movement, of
course, was absurd; but we all did our best to forward, not it, but
him. It came time for the annual county-meeting on this subject
to be held at Naguadavick. Isaacs came round, good fellow! to
arrange for it—got the townhall, got the Governor to preside (the
saint!—he ought to have triplet doubles provided him by law), and
then came to get me to speak. “No,” I said, “I would not speak, if
ten Governors presided. I do not believe in the enterprise. If I
spoke, it should be to say children should take hold of the prongs
of the forks and the blades of the knives. I would subscribe ten
dollars, but I would not speak a mill.” So poor Isaacs went his
way, sadly, to coax Auchmuty to speak, and Delafield. I went out.
Not long after, he came back, and told Polly that they had promised
to speak—the Governor would speak—and he himself would close with
the quarterly report, and some interesting anecdotes regarding.
Miss Biffin’s way of handling her knife and Mr. Nellis’s way of
footing his fork. “Now if Mr. Ingham will only come and sit on the
platform, he need not say one word; but it will show well in the
paper—it will show that the Sandemanians take as much interest
in the movement as the Armenians or the Mesopotamians, and will
be a great favor to me.” Polly, good soul! was tempted, and she
promised. She knew Mrs. Isaacs was starving, and the babies—she
knew Dennis was at home—and she promised! Night came, and I
returned. I heard her story. I was sorry. I doubted. But Polly had
promised to beg me, and I dared all! I told Dennis to hold his
peace, under all circumstances, and sent him down.

It was not half an hour more before he returned, wild with
excitement—in a perfect Irish fury—which it was long before I
understood. But I knew at once that he had undone me!

What happened was this: The audience got together, attracted by
Governor Gorges’s name. There were a thousand people. Poor Gorges
was late from Augusta. They became impatient. He came in direct
from the train at last, really ignorant of the object of the
meeting. He opened it in the fewest possible words, and said other
gentlemen were present who would entertain them better than he.
The audience were disappointed, but waited. The Governor, prompted
by Isaacs, said, “The Honorable Mr. Delafield will address you.”
Delafield had forgotten the knives and forks, and was playing the
Ruy Lopez opening at the chess club. “The Rev. Mr. Auchmuty will
address you.” Auchmuty had promised to speak late, and was at the
school committee. “I see Dr. Stearns in the hall; perhaps he will
say a word.” Dr. Stearns said he had come to listen and not to
speak. The Governor and Isaacs whispered. The Governor looked at
Dennis, who was resplendent on the platform; but Isaacs, to give
him his due, shook his head. But the look was enough. A miserable
lad, ill-bred, who had once been in Boston, thought it would sound
well to call for me, and peeped out, “Ingham!” A few more wretches
cried, “Ingham! Ingham!” Still Isaacs was firm; but the Governor,
anxious, indeed, to prevent a row, knew I would say something,
and said, “Our friend Mr. Ingham is always prepared—and though we
had not relied upon him, he will say a word, perhaps.” Applause
followed, which turned Dennis’s head. He rose, flattered, and
tried No. 3: “There has been so much said, and, on the whole, so
well said, that I will not longer occupy the time!” and sat down,
looking for his hat; for things seemed squally. But the people
cried, “Go on! go on!” and some applauded. Dennis, still confused,
but flattered by the applause, to which neither he nor I are used,
rose again, and this time tried No. 2: “I am very glad you liked
it!” in a sonorous, clear delivery. My best friends stared. All
the people who did not know me personally yelled with delight at
the aspect of the evening; the Governor was beside himself, and
poor Isaacs thought he was undone! Alas, it was I! A boy in the
gallery cried in a loud tone, “It’s all an infernal humbug,” just
as Dennis, waving his hand, commanded silence, and tried No. 4:
“I agree, in general, with my friend the other side of the room.”
The poor Governor doubted his senses, and crossed to stop him—not
in time, however. The same gallery-boy shouted, “How’s your
mother?”—and Dennis, now completely lost, tried, as his last shot,
No. 1, vainly: “Very well, thank you; and you?”

I think I must have been undone already. But Dennis, like another
Lockhard chose “to make sicker.” The audience rose in a whirl of
amazement, rage, and sorrow. Some other impertinence, aimed at
Dennis, broke all restraint, and, in pure Irish, he delivered
himself of an address to the gallery, inviting any person who
wished to fight to come down and do so—stating, that they were all
dogs and cowards—that he would take any five of them single-handed,
“Shure, I have said all his Riverence and the Misthress bade me
say,” cried he, in defiance; and, seizing the Governor’s cane from
his hand, brandished it, quarter-staff fashion, above his head. He
was, indeed, got from the hall only with the greatest difficulty
by the Governor, the City Marshal, who had been called in, and the
Superintendent of my Sunday School.

The universal impression, of course, was, that the Rev. Frederic
Ingham had lost all command of himself in some of those haunts
of intoxication which for fifteen years I have been laboring to
destroy. Till this moment, indeed, that is the impression in
Naguadavick. This number of _The Atlantic_ will relieve from it a
hundred friends of mine who have been sadly wounded by that notion
now for years—but I shall not be likely ever to show my head there
again.

No! My double has undone me.

We left town at seven the next morning. I came to No. 9, in the
Third Range, and settled on the Minister’s Lot, In the new towns in
Maine, the first settled minister has a gift of a hundred acres of
land. I am the first settled minister in No. 9. My wife and little
Paulina are my parish. We raise corn enough to live on in summer.
We kill bear’s meat enough to carbonize it in winter. I work on
steadily on my _Traces of Sandemanianism in the Sixth and Seventh
Centuries_, which I hope to persuade Phillips, Sampson & Co. to
publish next year. We are very happy, but the world thinks we are
undone.

A VISIT TO THE ASYLUM FOR AGED AND DECAYED PUNSTERS[17]

By Oliver Wendell Holmes (1809–1894)


Having just returned from a visit to this admirable Institution
in company with a friend who is one of the Directors, we propose
giving a short account of what we saw and heard. The great success
of the Asylum for Idiots and Feeble-minded Youth, several of the
scholars from which have reached considerable distinction, one
of them being connected with a leading Daily Paper in this city,
and others having served in the State and National Legislatures,
was the motive which led to the foundation of this excellent
charity. Our late distinguished townsman, Noah Dow, Esquire, as
is well known, bequeathed a large portion of his fortune to this
establishment— “being thereto moved,” as his will expressed it, “by
the desire of _N. Dowing_ some public Institution for the benefit
of Mankind.” Being consulted as to the Rules of the Institution and
the selection of a Superintendent, he replied, that “all Boards
must construct their own Platforms of operation. Let them select
_anyhow_ and he should be pleased.” N.E. Howe, Esq., was chosen in
compliance with this delicate suggestion.

The Charter provides for the support of “One hundred aged and
decayed Gentlemen-Punsters.” On inquiry if there way no provision
for _females_, my friend called my attention to this remarkable
psychological fact, namely:

THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A FEMALE PUNSTER.

This remark struck me forcibly, and on reflection I found that _I
never knew nor heard of one_, though I have once or twice heard a
woman make a _single detached_ pun, as I have known a hen to crow.

On arriving at the south gate of the Asylum grounds, I was about to
ring, but my friend held my arm and begged me to rap with my stick,
which I did. An old man with a very comical face presently opened
the gate and put out his head.

“So you prefer _Cane_ to _A bell_, do you?” he said—and began
chuckling and coughing at a great rate.

My friend winked at me.

“You’re here still, Old Joe, I see,” he said to the old man.

“Yes, yes—and it’s very odd, considering how often I’ve _bolted_,
nights.”

He then threw open the double gates for us to ride through.

“Now,” said the old man, as he pulled the gates after us, “you’ve
had a long journey.”

“Why, how is that, Old Joe?” said my friend.

“Don’t you see?” he answered; “there’s the _East hinges_ on the
one side of the gate, and there’s the _West hinges_ on t’other
side—haw! haw! haw!”

We had no sooner got into the yard than a feeble little gentleman,
with a remarkably bright eye, came up to us, looking very serious,
as if something had happened.

“The town has entered a complaint against the Asylum as a gambling
establishment,” he said to my friend, the Director.

“What do you mean?” said my friend.

“Why, they complain that there’s a _lot o’ rye_ on the premises,”
he answered, pointing to a field of that grain—and hobbled away,
his shoulders shaking with laughter, as he went.

On entering the main building, we saw the Rules and Regulations for
the Asylum conspicuously posted up. I made a few extracts which may
be interesting:


SECT. I. OF VERBAL EXERCISES.

    5. Each Inmate shall be permitted to make Puns freely from eight
    in the morning until ten at night, except during Service in the
    Chapel and Grace before Meals.

    6. At ten o’clock the gas will be turned off, and no further
    Puns, Conundrums, or other play on words will be allowed to be
    uttered, or to be uttered aloud.

    9. Inmates who have lost their faculties and cannot any longer
    make Puns shall be permitted to repeat such as may be selected
    for them by the Chaplain out of the work of _Mr. Joseph Miller_.

    10. Violent and unmanageable Punsters, who interrupt others when
    engaged in conversation, with Puns or attempts at the same,
    shall be deprived of their _Joseph Millers_, and, if necessary,
    placed in solitary confinement.


SECT. III. OF DEPORTMENT AT MEALS.

    4. No Inmate shall make any Pun, or attempt at the same, until
    the Blessing has been asked and the company are decently seated.

    7. Certain Puns having been placed on the _Index Expurgatorius_
    of the Institution, no Inmate shall be allowed to utter them, on
    pain of being debarred the perusal of _Punch_ and _Vanity Fair_,
    and, if repeated, deprived of his _Joseph Miller_.

    Among these are the following:

    Allusions to _Attic salt_, when asked to pass the salt-cellar.

    Remarks on the Inmates being _mustered_, etc., etc.

    Associating baked beans with the _bene_-factors of the
    Institution.

    Saying that beef-eating is _befitting_, etc., etc.

    The following are also prohibited, excepting to such Inmates as
    may have lost their faculties and cannot any longer make Puns of
    their own:

    “——your own _hair_ or a wig”; “it will be _long enough_,” etc.,
    etc.; “little of its age,” etc., etc.; also, playing upon the
    following words: _hos_pital; _mayor_; _pun_; _pitied_; _bread_;
    _sauce_, etc., etc., etc. _See_ INDEX EXPURGATORIUS, _printed
    for use of Inmates_.

    The subjoined Conundrum is not allowed: Why is Hasty Pudding
    like the Prince? Because it comes attended by its _sweet_; nor
    this variation to it, _to wit_: Because the _’lasses runs after
    it_.

The Superintendent, who went round with us, had been a noted
punster in his time, and well known in the business world, but lost
his customers by making too free with their names—as in the famous
story he set afloat in ’29 _of four Jerries_ attaching to the names
of a noted Judge, an eminent Lawyer, the Secretary of the Board
of Foreign Missions, and the well-known Landlord at Springfield.
One of the _four Jerries_, he added, was of gigantic magnitude.
The play on words was brought out by an accidental remark of
Solomons, the well-known Banker. “_Capital punishment_!” the Jew
was overheard saying, with reference to the guilty parties. He was
understood, as saying, _A capital pun is meant_, which led to an
investigation and the relief of the greatly excited public mind.

The Superintendent showed some of his old tendencies, as he went
round with us.

“Do you know”—he broke out all at once—“why they don’t take steppes
in Tartary for establishing Insane Hospitals?”

We both confessed ignorance.

“Because there are _nomad_ people to be found there,” he said, with
a dignified smile.

He proceeded to introduce us to different Inmates. The first was
a middle-aged, scholarly man, who was seated at a table with a
_Webster’s Dictionary_ and a sheet of paper before him.

“Well, what luck to-day, Mr. Mowzer?” said the Superintendent.

“Three or four only,” said Mr. Mowzer. “Will you hear ’em now—now
I’m here?”

We all nodded.

“Don’t you see Webster _ers_ in the words cent_er_ and theat_er_?

“If he spells leather _lether_, and feather _fether_, isn’t there
danger that he’ll give us a _bad spell of weather_?

“Besides, Webster is a resurrectionist; he does not allow _u_ to
rest quietly in the _mould_.

“And again, because Mr. Worcester inserts an illustration in his
text, is that any reason why Mr. Webster’s publishers should hitch
one on in their appendix? It’s what I call a _Connect-a-cut_ trick.

“Why is his way of spelling like the floor of an oven? Because it
is _under bread_.”

“Mowzer!” said the Superintendent, “that word is on the Index!”

“I forgot,” said Mr. Mowzer; “please don’t deprive me of _Vanity
Fair_ this one time, sir.”

“These are all, this morning. Good day, gentlemen.” Then to the
Superintendent: “Add you, sir!”

The next Inmate was a semi-idiotic-looking old man. He had a heap
of block-letters before him, and, as we came up, he pointed,
without saying a word, to the arrangements he had made with them
on the table. They were evidently anagrams, and had the merit of
transposing the letters of the words employed without addition or
subtraction. Here are a few of them:

        TIMES.                      SMITE!
        POST.                       STOP!

      TRIBUNE.                    TRUE NIB.
      WORLD.                      DR. OWL.

    ADVERTISER.  {  RES VERI DAT.
                 {  IS TRUE. READ!

  ALLOPATHY.     ALL O’ TH’ PAY.
  HOMŒOPATHY.    O, THE ——! O! O, MY! PAH!

The mention of several New York papers led to two or three
questions. Thus: Whether the Editor of _The Tribune_ was _H.G.
really_? If the complexion of his politics were not accounted for
by his being _an eager_ person himself? Whether Wendell _Fillips_
were not a reduced copy of John _Knocks_? Whether a New York
_Feuilletoniste_ is not the same thing as a _Fellow down East_?

At this time a plausible-looking, bald-headed man joined us,
evidently waiting to take a part in the conversation.

“Good morning, Mr. Riggles,” said the Superintendent, “Anything
fresh this morning? Any Conundrum?”

“I haven’t looked at the cattle,” he answered, dryly.

“Cattle? Why cattle?”

“Why, to see if there’s any _corn under ’em_!” he said; and
immediately asked, “Why is Douglas like the earth?”

We tried, but couldn’t guess.

“Because he was _flattened out at the polls_!” said Mr. Riggles.

“A famous politician, formerly,” said the Superintendent. “His
grandfather was a _seize-Hessian-ist_ in the Revolutionary War. By
the way, I hear the _freeze-oil_ doctrines don’t go down at New
Bedford.”

The next Inmate looked as if he might have been a sailor formerly.

“Ask him what his calling was,” said the Superintendent.

“Followed the sea,” he replied to the question put by one of us.
“Went as mate in a fishing-schooner.”

“Why did you give it up?”

“Because I didn’t like working for _two mast-ers_,” he replied.

Presently we came upon a group of elderly persons, gathered about
a venerable gentleman with flowing locks, who was propounding
questions to a row of Inmates.

“Can any Inmate give me a motto for M. Berger?” he said.

Nobody responded for two or three minutes. At last one old man,
whom I at once recognized as a Graduate of our University (Anno
1800) held up his hand.

“Rem _a cue_ tetigit.”

“Go to the head of the class, Josselyn,” said the venerable
patriarch.

The successful Inmate did as he was told, but in a very rough way,
pushing against two or three of the Class.

“How is this?” said the Patriarch.

“You told me to go up _jostlin’_,” he replied.

The old gentlemen who had been shoved about enjoyed the pun too
much to be angry.

Presently the Patriarch asked again:

“Why was M. Berger authorized to go to the dances given to the
Prince?”

The Class had to give up this, and he answered it himself:

“Because every one of his carroms was a _tick-it_ to the ball.”

“Who collects the money to defray the expenses of the last campaign
in Italy?” asked the Patriarch.

Here again the Class failed.

“The war-cloud’s rolling _Dun_,” he answered.

“And what is mulled wine made with?”

Three or four voices exclaimed at once:

“_Sizzle-y_ Madeira!”

Here a servant entered, and said, “Luncheon-time.” The old
gentlemen, who have excellent appetites, dispersed at once, one
of them politely asking us if we would not stop and have a bit of
bread and a little mite of cheese.

“There is one thing I have forgotten to show you,” said the
Superintendent, “the cell for the confinement of violent and
unmanageable Punsters.”

We were very curious to see it, particularly with reference to the
alleged absence of every object upon which a play of words could
possibly be made.

The Superintendent led us up some dark stairs to a corridor, then
along a narrow passage, then down a broad flight of steps into
another passageway, and opened a large door which looked out on the
main entrance.

“We have not seen the cell for the confinement of ‘violent and
unmanageable’ Punsters,” we both exclaimed.

“This is the _sell_!” he exclaimed, pointing to the outside
prospect.

My friend, the Director, looked me in the face so good-naturedly
that I had to laugh.

“We like to humor the Inmates,” he said. “It has a bad effect,
we find, on their health and spirits to disappoint them of their
little pleasantries. Some of the jests to which we have listened
are not new to me, though I dare say you may not have heard them
often before. The same thing happens in general society, with this
additional disadvantage, that there is no punishment provided for
‘violent and unmanageable’ Punsters, as in our Institution.”

We made our bow to the Superintendent and walked to the place
where our carriage was waiting for us. On our way, an exceedingly
decrepit old man moved slowly toward us, with a perfectly blank
look on his face, but still appearing as if he wished to speak.

“Look!” said the Director—“that is our Centenarian.”

The ancient man crawled toward us, cocked one eye, with which he
seemed to see a little, up at us, and said:

“Sarvant, young Gentlemen. Why is a—a—a—like a—a—a—? Give it up?
Because it’s a—a—a—a—.”

He smiled a pleasant smile, as if it were all plain enough.

“One hundred and seven last Christmas,” said the Director. “Of late
years he puts his whole Conundrums in blank—but they please him
just as well.”

We took our departure, much gratified and instructed by our visit,
hoping to have some future opportunity of inspecting the Records of
this excellent Charity and making extracts for the benefit of our
Readers.

THE CELEBRATED JUMPING FROG OF CALAVERAS COUNTY[18]

By Mark Twain (1835–1910)


In compliance with the request of a friend of mine, who wrote
me from the East, I called on good-natured, garrulous old Simon
Wheeler, and inquired after my friend’s friend, Leonidas W. Smiley,
as requested to do, and I hereunto append the result. I have a
lurking suspicion that _Leonidas W._ Smiley is a myth; and that my
friend never knew such a personage; and that he only conjectured
that if I asked old Wheeler about him, it would remind him of his
infamous _Jim Smiley_, and he would go to work and bore me to death
with some exasperating reminiscence of him as long and as tedious
as it should be useless to me. If that was the design, it succeeded.

I found Simon Wheeler dozing comfortably by the bar-room stove of
the dilapidated tavern in the decayed mining camp of Angel’s, and I
noticed that he was fat and bald-headed, and had an expression of
winning gentleness and simplicity upon his tranquil countenance.
He roused up, and gave me good-day. I told him a friend had
commissioned me to make some inquiries about a cherished companion
of his boyhood named _Leonidas W_. Smiley—_Rev. Leonidas W._
Smiley, a young minister of the Gospel, who he had heard was at one
time a resident of Angel’s Camp. I added that if Mr. Wheeler could
tell me anything about this Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, I would feel
under many obligations to him.

Simon Wheeler backed me into a corner and blockaded me there
with his chair, and then sat down and reeled off the monotonous
narrative which follows this paragraph. He never smiled, he never
frowned, he never changed his voice from the gentle-flowing key
to which he tuned his initial sentence, he never betrayed the
slightest suspicion of enthusiasm; but all through the interminable
narrative there ran a vein of impressive earnestness and sincerity,
which showed me plainly that, so far from his imagining that there
was anything ridiculous or funny about his story, he regarded it
as a really important matter, and admired its two heroes as men of
transcendent genius in _finesse_. I let him go on in his own way,
and never interrupted him once.

“Rev. Leonidas W. H’m, Reverend Le—well, there was a feller here
once by the name of _Jim_ Smiley, in the winter of ’49—or may be it
was the spring of ’50—I don’t recollect exactly, somehow, though
what makes me think it was one or the other is because I remember
the big flume warn’t finished when he first came to the camp; but
any way, he was the curiousest man about always betting on anything
that turned up you ever see, if he could get anybody to bet on the
other side; and if he couldn’t he’d change sides. Any way that
suited the other man would suit _him_—any way just so’s he got a
bet, _he_ was satisfied. But still he was lucky, uncommon lucky;
he most always come out winner. He was always ready and laying for
a chance; there couldn’t be no solit’ry thing mentioned but that
feller’d offer to bet on it, and take any side you please, as I
was just telling you. If there was a horse-race, you’d find him
flush or you’d find him busted at the end of it; if there was a
dog-fight, he’d bet on it; if there was a cat-fight, he’d bet on
it; if there was a chicken-fight, he’d bet on it; why, if there was
two birds setting on a fence, he would bet you which one would fly
first; or if there was a camp-meeting, he would be there reg’lar
to bet on Parson Walker, which he judged to be the best exhorter
about here, and he was, too, and a good man. If he even see a
straddle-bug start to go anywheres, he would bet you how long it
would take him to get to—to wherever he _was_ going to, and if you
took him up, he would foller that straddle-bug to Mexico but what
he would find out where he was bound for and how long he was on
the road. Lots of the boys here has seen that Smiley and can tell
you about him. Why, it never made no difference to _him_—he’d bet
on _any_ thing—the dangest feller. Parson Walker’s wife laid very
sick once, for a good while, and it seemed as if they warn’t going
to save her; but one morning he come in, and Smiley up and asked
him how she was, and he said she was considerable better—thank the
Lord for his inf’nit’ mercy—and coming on so smart that with the
blessing of Prov’dence she’d get well yet; and Smiley, before he
thought, says, ‘Well, I’ll risk two-and-a-half she don’t anyway.’”

Thish-yer Smiley had a mare—the boys called her the fifteen-minute
nag, but that was only in fun, you know, because, of course, she
was faster than that—and he used to win money on that horse, for
all she was so slow and always had the asthma, or the distemper,
or the consumption, or something of that kind. They used to give
her two or three hundred yards start, and then pass her under
way; but always at the fag-end of the race she’d get excited
and desperate-like, and come cavorting and straddling up, and
scattering her legs around limber, sometimes in the air, and
sometimes out to one side amongst the fences, and kicking up
m-o-r-e dust and raising m-o-r-e racket with her coughing and
sneezing and blowing her nose—and always fetch up at the stand just
about a neck ahead, as near as you could cipher it down.

And he had a little small bull-pup, that to look at him you’d think
he warn’t worth a cent but to set around and look ornery and lay
for a chance to steal something. But as soon as money was up on him
he was a different dog; his under-jaw’d begin to stick out like the
fo’-castle of a steamboat, and his teeth would uncover and shine
like the furnaces. And a dog might tackle him and bully-rag him,
and bite him, and throw him over his shoulder two or three times,
and Andrew Jackson—which was the name of the pup—Andrew Jackson
would never let on but what _he_ was satisfied, and hadn’t expected
nothing else—and the bets being doubled and doubled on the other
side all the time, till the money was all up; and then all of a
sudden he would grab that other dog jest by the j’int of his hind
leg and freeze to it—not chaw, you understand, but only just grip
and hang on till they throwed up the sponge, if it was a year.
Smiley always come out winner on that pup, till he harnessed a dog
once that didn’t have no hind legs, because they’d been sawed off
in a circular saw, and when the thing had gone along far enough,
and the money was all up, and he come to make a snatch for his
pet holt, he see in a minute how he’d been imposed on, and how
the other dog had him in the door, so to speak, and he ’peared
surprised, and then he looked sorter discouraged-like, and didn’t
try no more to win the fight, and so he got shucked out bad. He
gave Smiley a look, as much as to say his heart was broke, and it
was _his_ fault, for putting up a dog that hadn’t no hind legs for
him to take holt of, which was his main dependence in a fight,
and then he limped off a piece and laid down and died. It was a
good pup, was that Andrew Jackson, and would have made a name for
hisself if he’d lived, for the stuff was in him and he had genius—I
know it, because he hadn’t no opportunities to speak of, and it
don’t stand to reason that a dog could make such a fight as he
could under them circumstances if he hadn’t no talent. It always
makes me feel sorry when I think of that last fight of his’n, and
the way it turned out.

Well, thish-yer Smiley had rat-tarriers, and chicken cocks, and
tom-cats and all of them kind of things, till you couldn’t rest,
and you couldn’t fetch nothing for him to bet on but he’d match
you. He ketched a frog one day, and took him home, and said he
cal’lated to educate him; and so he never done nothing for three
months but set in his back yard and learn that frog to jump. And
you bet you he _did_ learn him, too. He’d give him a little punch
behind, and the next minute you’d see that frog whirling in the air
like a doughnut—see him turn one summerset, or may be a couple, if
he got a good start, and come down flat-footed and all right, like
a cat. He got him up so in the matter of ketching flies, and kep’
him in practice so constant, that he’d nail a fly every time as fur
as he could see him. Smiley said all a frog wanted was education,
and he could do ’most anything—and I believe him. Why, I’ve seen
him set Dan’l Webster down here on this floor—Dan’l Webster was the
name of the frog—and sing out, “Flies, Dan’l, flies!” and quicker’n
you could wink he’d spring straight up and snake a fly off’n the
counter there, and flop down on the floor ag’in as solid as a
gob of mud, and fall to scratching the side of his head with his
hind foot as indifferent as if he hadn’t no idea he’d been doin’
any more’n any frog might do. You never see a frog so modest and
straightfor’ard as he was, for all he was so gifted. And when it
come to fair and square jumping on a dead level, he could get over
more ground at one straddle than any animal of his breed you ever
see. Jumping on a dead level was his strong suit, you understand;
and when it come to that, Smiley would ante up money on him as long
as he had a red. Smiley was monstrous proud of his frog, and well
he might be, for fellers that had traveled and been everywheres,
all said he laid over any frog that ever _they_ see.

Well, Smiley kep’ the beast in a little lattice box, and he used to
fetch him downtown sometimes and lay for a bet. One day a feller—a
stranger in the camp, he was—come acrost him with his box, and says:

“What might be that you’ve got in the box?”

And Smiley says, sorter indifferent-like, “It might be a parrot, or
it might be a canary, maybe, but it ain’t—it’s only just a frog.”

And the feller took it, and looked at it careful, and turned it
round this way and that, and says, “H’m—so ’tis. Well, what’s _he_
good for?”

“Well,” Smiley says, easy and careless, “he’s good enough for _one_
thing, I should judge—he can outjump any frog in Calaveras county.”

The feller took the box again, and took another long, particular
look, and give it back to Smiley, and says, very deliberate,
“Well,” he says, “I don’t see no p’ints about that frog that’s any
better’n any other frog.”

“Maybe you don’t,” Smiley says. “Maybe you understand frogs and
maybe you don’t understand ’em; maybe you’ve had experience, and
maybe you ain’t only a amature, as it were. Anyways, I’ve got _my_
opinion and I’ll risk forty dollars that he can outjump any frog in
Calaveras County.”

And the feller studied a minute, and then says, kinder sad like,
“Well, I’m only a stranger here, and I ain’t got no frog; but if I
had a frog, I’d bet you.”

And then Smiley says, “That’s all right—that’s all right—if
you’ll hold my box a minute, I’ll go and get you a frog.” And so
the feller took the box, and put up his forty dollars along with
Smiley’s, and set down to wait.

So he set there a good while thinking and thinking to hisself,
and then he got the frog out and prized his mouth open and took a
teaspoon and filled him full of quail shot—filled! him pretty near
up to his chin—and set him on the floor. Smiley he went to the
swamp and slopped around in the mud for a long time, and finally he
ketched a frog, and fetched him in, and give him to this feller,
and says:

“Now, if you’re ready, set him alongside of Dan’l, with his
forepaws just even with Dan’l’s, and I’ll give the word.” Then he
says, “One—two—three—_git_!” and him and the feller touched up the
frogs from behind, and the new frog hopped off lively, but Dan’l
give a heave, and hysted up his shoulders—so—like a Frenchman, but
it warn’t no use—he couldn’t budge; he was planted as solid as a
church, and he couldn’t no more stir than if he was anchored out.
Smiley was a good deal surprised, and he was disgusted too, but he
didn’t have no idea what the matter was, of course.

The feller took the money and started away; and when he was going
out at the door, he sorter jerked his thumb over his shoulder—so—at
Dan’l, and says again, very deliberate, “Well,” he says, “_I_ don’t
see no p’ints about that frog that’s any better’n any other frog.”

Smiley he stood scratching his head and looking down at Dan’l a
long time, and at last says, “I do wonder what in the nation that
frog throwed off for—I wonder if there ain’t something the matter
with him—he ’pears to look mighty baggy, somehow.” And he ketched
Dan’l up by the nap of the neck, and hefted him, and says, “Why
blame my cats if he don’t weigh five pounds!” and turned him upside
down and he belched out a double handful of shot. And then he see
how it was, and he was the maddest man—he set the frog down and
took out after that feller, but he never ketched him. And——

(Here Simon Wheeler heard his name called from the front yard, and
got up to see what was wanted.) And turning to me as he moved away,
he said: “Just set where you are, stranger, and rest easy—I ain’t
going to be gone a second.”

But, by your leave, I did not think that a continuation of the
history of the enterprising vagabond _Jim_ Smiley would be likely
to afford me much information concerning the Rev. _Leonidas W._
Smiley, and so I started away.

At the door I met the sociable Wheeler returning, and he
buttonholed me and recommenced:

“Well, thish-yer Smiley had a yaller, one-eyed cow that didn’t have
no tail, only jest a short stump like a bannanner, and——”

However, lacking both time and inclination, I did not wait to hear
about the afflicted cow, but took my leave.

ELDER BROWN’S BACKSLIDE[19]

By Harry Stillwell Edwards (1855- )


I

Elder Brown told his wife good-by at the farmhouse door as
mechanically as though his proposed trip to Macon, ten miles away,
was an everyday affair, while, as a matter of fact, many years had
elapsed since unaccompanied he set foot in the city. He did not
kiss her. Many very good men never kiss their wives. But small
blame attaches to the elder for his omission on this occasion,
since his wife had long ago discouraged all amorous demonstrations
on the part of her liege lord, and at this particular moment was
filling the parting moments with a rattling list of directions
concerning thread, buttons, hooks, needles, and all the many
etceteras of an industrious housewife’s basket. The elder was
laboriously assorting these postscript commissions in his memory,
well knowing that to return with any one of them neglected would
cause trouble in the family circle.

Elder Brown mounted his patient steed that stood sleepily
motionless in the warm sunlight, with his great pointed ears
displayed to the right and left, as though their owner had grown
tired of the life burden their weight inflicted upon him, and was,
old soldier fashion, ready to forego the once rigid alertness of
early training for the pleasures of frequent rest on arms.

“And, elder, don’t you forgit them caliker scraps, or you’ll be
wantin’ kiver soon an’ no kiver will be a-comin’.”

Elder Brown did not turn his head, but merely let the whip hand,
which had been checked in its backward motion, fall as he answered
mechanically. The beast he bestrode responded with a rapid whisking
of its tail and a great show of effort, as it ambled off down the
sandy road, the rider’s long legs seeming now and then to touch the
ground.

But as the zigzag panels of the rail fence crept behind him, and
he felt the freedom of the morning beginning to act upon his
well-trained blood, the mechanical manner of the old man’s mind
gave place to a mild exuberance. A weight seemed to be lifting
from it ounce by ounce as the fence panels, the weedy corners, the
persimmon sprouts and sassafras bushes crept away behind him, so
that by the time a mile lay between him and the life partner of his
joys and sorrows he was in a reasonably contented frame of mind,
and still improving.

It was a queer figure that crept along the road that cheery May
morning. It was tall and gaunt, and had been for thirty years or
more. The long head, bald on top, covered behind with iron-gray
hair, and in front with a short tangled growth that curled and
kinked in every direction, was surmounted by an old-fashioned
stove-pipe hat, worn and stained, but eminently impressive. An
old-fashioned Henry Clay cloth coat, stained and threadbare,
divided itself impartially over the donkey’s back and dangled on
his sides. This was all that remained of the elder’s wedding suit
of forty years ago. Only constant care, and use of late years
limited to extra occasions, had preserved it so long. The trousers
had soon parted company with their friends. The substitutes were
red jeans, which, while they did not well match his court costume,
were better able to withstand the old man’s abuse, for if, in
addition to his frequent religious excursions astride his beast,
there ever was a man who was fond of sitting down with his feet
higher than his head, it was this selfsame Elder Brown.

The morning expanded, and the old man expanded with it; for while
a vigorous leader in his church, the elder at home was, it must be
admitted, an uncomplaining slave. To the intense astonishment of
the beast he rode, there came new vigor into the whacks which fell
upon his flanks; and the beast allowed astonishment to surprise
him into real life and decided motion. Somewhere in the elder’s
expanding soul a tune had begun to ring. Possibly he took up the
far, faint tune that came from the straggling gang of negroes away
off in the field, as they slowly chopped amid the threadlike rows
of cotton plants which lined the level ground, for the melody he
hummed softly and then sang strongly, in the quavering, catchy
tones of a good old country churchman, was “I’m glad salvation’s
free.”

It was during the singing of this hymn that Elder Brown’s regular
motion-inspiring strokes were for the first time varied. He began
to hold his hickory up at certain pauses in the melody, and beat
the changes upon the sides of his astonished steed. The chorus
under this arrangement was:

      I’m _glad_ salvation’s _free_,
      I’m _glad_ salvation’s _free_,
      I’m _glad_ salvation’s _free_ for _all_,
      I’m _glad_ salvation’s _free_.

Wherever there is an italic, the hickory descended. It fell about
as regularly and after the fashion of the stick beating upon the
bass drum during a funeral march. But the beast, although convinced
that something serious was impending, did not consider a funeral
march appropriate for the occasion. He protested, at first, with
vigorous whiskings of his tail and a rapid shifting of his ears.
Finding these demonstrations unavailing, and convinced that some
urgent cause for hurry had suddenly invaded the elder’s serenity,
as it had his own, he began to cover the ground with frantic leaps
that would have surprised his owner could he have realized what
was going on. But Elder Brown’s eyes were half closed, and he
was singing at the top of his voice. Lost in a trance of divine
exaltation, for he felt the effects of the invigorating motion,
bent only on making the air ring with the lines which he dimly
imagined were drawing upon him the eyes of the whole female
congregation, he was supremely unconscious that his beast was
hurrying.

And thus the excursion proceeded, until suddenly a shote, surprised
in his calm search for roots in a fence corner, darted into the
road, and stood for an instant gazing upon the newcomers with that
idiotic stare which only a pig can imitate. The sudden appearance
of this unlooked-for apparition acted strongly upon the donkey.
With one supreme effort he collected himself into a motionless mass
of matter, bracing his front legs wide apart; that is to say, he
stopped short. There he stood, returning the pig’s idiotic stare
with an interest which must have led to the presumption that never
before in all his varied life had he seen such a singular little
creature. End over end went the man of prayer, finally bringing up
full length in the sand, striking just as he should have shouted
“free” for the fourth time in his glorious chorus.

Fully convinced that his alarm had been well founded, the shote
sped out from under the gigantic missile hurled at him by the
donkey, and scampered down the road, turning first one ear and
then the other to detect any sounds of pursuit. The donkey,
also convinced that the object before which he had halted was
supernatural, started back violently upon seeing it apparently turn
to a man. But seeing that it had turned to nothing but a man, he
wandered up into the deserted fence corner, and began to nibble
refreshment from a scrub oak.

For a moment the elder gazed up into the sky, half impressed with
the idea that the camp-meeting platform had given way. But the
truth forced its way to the front in his disordered understanding
at last, and with painful dignity he staggered into an upright
position, and regained his beaver. He was shocked again. Never
before in all the long years it had served him had he seen it
in such shape. The truth is, Elder Brown had never before tried
to stand on his head in it. As calmly as possible he began to
straighten it out, caring but little for the dust upon his
garments. The beaver was his special crown of dignity. To lose it
was to be reduced to a level with the common woolhat herd. He did
his best, pulling, pressing, and pushing, but the hat did not look
natural when he had finished. It seemed to have been laid off into
counties, sections, and town lots. Like a well-cut jewel, it had a
face for him, view it from whatever point he chose, a quality which
so impressed him that a lump gathered in his throat, and his eyes
winked vigorously.

Elder Brown was not, however, a man for tears. He was a man of
action. The sudden vision which met his wandering gaze, the donkey
calmly chewing scrub buds, with the green juice already oozing
from the corners of his frothy mouth, acted upon him like magic.
He was, after all, only human, and when he got hands upon a piece
of brush he thrashed the poor beast until it seemed as though even
its already half-tanned hide would be eternally ruined. Thoroughly
exhausted at last, he wearily straddled his saddle, and with his
chin upon his breast resumed the early morning tenor of his way.


II

“Good-mornin’, sir.”

Elder Brown leaned over the little pine picket which divided the
bookkeepers’ department of a Macon warehouse from the room in
general, and surveyed the well-dressed back of a gentleman who was
busily figuring at a desk within. The apartment was carpetless, and
the dust of a decade lay deep on the old books, shelves, and the
familiar advertisements of guano and fertilizers which decorated
the room. An old stove, rusty with the nicotine contributed by
farmers during the previous season while waiting by its glowing
sides for their cotton to be sold, stood straight up in a bed of
sand, and festoons of cobwebs clung to the upper sashes of the
murky windows. The lower sash of one window had been raised, and
in the yard without, nearly an acre in extent, lay a few bales
of cotton, with jagged holes in their ends, just as the sampler
had left them. Elder Brown had time to notice all these familiar
points, for the figure at the desk kept serenely at its task, and
deigned no reply.

“Good-mornin’, sir,” said Elder Brown again, in his most dignified
tones. “Is Mr. Thomas in?”

“Good-morning, sir,” said the figure. “I’ll wait on you in a
minute.” The minute passed, and four more joined it. Then the desk
man turned.

“Well, sir, what can I do for you?”

The elder was not in the best of humor when he arrived, and his
state of mind had not improved. He waited full a minute as he
surveyed the man of business.

“I thought I mout be able to make some arrangements with you to git
some money, but I reckon I was mistaken.” The warehouse man came
nearer.

“This is Mr. Brown, I believe. I did not recognize you at once. You
are not in often to see us.”

“No; my wife usually ’tends to the town bizness, while I run the
church and farm. Got a fall from my donkey this morning,” he said,
noticing a quizzical, interrogating look upon the face before him,
“and fell squar’ on the hat.” He made a pretense of smoothing it.
The man of business had already lost interest.

“How much money will you want, Mr. Brown?”

“Well, about seven hundred dollars,” said the elder, replacing his
hat, and turning a furtive look upon the warehouse man. The other
was tapping with his pencil upon the little shelf lying across the
rail.

“I can get you five hundred.”

“But I oughter have seven.”

“Can’t arrange for that amount. Wait till later in the season,
and come again. Money is very tight now. How much cotton will you
raise?”

“Well, I count on a hundr’d bales. An’ you can’t git the sev’n
hundr’d dollars?”

“Like to oblige you, but can’t right now; will fix it for you later
on.”

“Well,” said the elder, slowly, “fix up the papers for five, an’
I’ll make it go as far as possible.”

The papers were drawn. A note was made out for $552.50, for the
interest was at one and a half per cent. for seven months, and a
mortgage on ten mules belonging to the elder was drawn and signed.
The elder then promised to send his cotton to the warehouse to be
sold in the fall, and with a curt “Anything else?” and a “Thankee,
that’s all,” the two parted.

Elder Brown now made an effort to recall the supplemental
commissions shouted to him upon his departure, intending to execute
them first, and then take his written list item by item. His mental
resolves had just reached this point when a new thought made itself
known. Passersby were puzzled to see the old man suddenly snatch
his headpiece off and peer with an intent and awestruck air into
its irregular caverns. Some of them were shocked when he suddenly
and vigorously ejaculated:

“Hannah-Maria-Jemimy! goldarn an’ blue blazes!”

He had suddenly remembered having placed his memoranda in that hat,
and as he studied its empty depths his mind pictured the important
scrap fluttering along the sandy scene of his early-morning tumble.
It was this that caused him to graze an oath with less margin that
he had allowed himself in twenty years. What would the old lady say?

Alas! Elder Brown knew too well. What she would not say was what
puzzled him. But as he stood bareheaded in the sunlight a sense
of utter desolation came and dwelt with him. His eye rested upon
sleeping Balaam anchored to a post in the street, and so as he
recalled the treachery that lay at the base of all his affliction,
gloom was added to the desolation.

To turn back and search for the lost paper would have been worse
than useless. Only one course was open to him, and at it went
the leader of his people. He called at the grocery; he invaded
the recesses of the dry-goods establishments; he ransacked the
hardware stores; and wherever he went he made life a burden for
the clerks, overhauling show-cases and pulling down whole shelves
of stock. Occasionally an item of his memoranda would come to
light, and thrusting his hand into his capacious pocket, where lay
the proceeds of his check, he would pay for it upon the spot, and
insist upon having it rolled up. To the suggestion of the slave
whom he had in charge for the time being that the articles be laid
aside until he had finished, he would not listen.

“Now you look here, sonny,” he said, in the dry-goods store, “I’m
conducting this revival, an’ I don’t need no help in my line. Just
you tie them stockin’s up an’ lemme have ’em. Then I _know_ I’ve
_got_ ’em.” As each purchase was promptly paid for, and change had
to be secured, the clerk earned his salary for that day at least.

So it was when, near the heat of the day, the good man arrived at
the drugstore, the last and only unvisited division of trade, he
made his appearance equipped with half a hundred packages, which
nestled in his arms and bulged out about the sections of his
clothing that boasted of pockets. As he deposited his deck-load
upon the counter, great drops of perspiration rolled down his face
and over his waterlogged collar to the floor.

There was something exquisitely refreshing in the great glasses
of foaming soda that a spruce young man was drawing from a marble
fountain, above which half a dozen polar bears in an ambitious
print were disporting themselves. There came a break in the run of
customers, and the spruce young man, having swept the foam from
the marble, dexterously lifted a glass from the revolving rack
which had rinsed it with a fierce little stream of water, and asked
mechanically, as he caught the intense look of the perspiring
elder, “What syrup, sir?”

Now it had not occurred to the elder to drink soda, but the
suggestion, coming as it did in his exhausted state, was
overpowering. He drew near awkwardly, put on his glasses, and
examined the list of syrups with great care. The young man, being
for the moment at leisure, surveyed critically the gaunt figure,
the faded bandanna, the antique clawhammer coat, and the battered
stove-pipe hat, with a gradually relaxing countenance. He even
called the prescription clerk’s attention by a cough and a quick
jerk of the thumb. The prescription clerk smiled freely, and
continued his assaults upon a piece of blue mass.

“I reckon,” said the elder, resting his hands upon his knees and
bending down to the list, “you may gimme sassprilla an’ a little
strawberry. Sassprilla’s good for the blood this time er year, an’
strawberry’s good any time.”

The spruce young man let the syrup stream into the glass as he
smiled affably. Thinking, perhaps, to draw out the odd character,
he ventured upon a jest himself, repeating a pun invented by the
man who made the first soda fountain. With a sweep of his arm he
cleared away the swarm of insects as he remarked, “People who like
a fly in theirs are easily accommodated.”

It was from sheer good-nature only that Elder Brown replied, with
his usual broad, social smile, “Well, a fly now an’ then don’t hurt
nobody.”

Now if there is anybody in the world who prides himself on knowing
a thing or two, it is the spruce young man who presides over a soda
fountain. This particular young gentleman did not even deem a reply
necessary. He vanished an instant, and when he returned a close
observer might have seen that the mixture in the glass he bore had
slightly changed color and increased in quantity. But the elder saw
only the whizzing stream of water dart into its center, and the
rosy foam rise and tremble on the glass’s rim. The next instant he
was holding his breath and sipping the cooling drink.

As Elder Brown paid his small score he was at peace with the world.
I firmly believe that when he had finished his trading, and the
little blue-stringed packages had been stored away, could the poor
donkey have made his appearance at the door, and gazed with his
meek, fawnlike eyes into his master’s, he would have obtained full
and free forgiveness.

Elder Brown paused at the door as he was about to leave. A
rosy-cheeked schoolgirl was just lifting a creamy mixture to her
lips before the fountain. It was a pretty picture, and he turned
back, resolved to indulge in one more glass of the delightful
beverage before beginning his long ride homeward.

“Fix it up again, sonny,” he said, renewing his broad, confiding
smile, as the spruce young man poised a glass inquiringly. The
living automaton went through the same motions as before, and again
Elder Brown quaffed the fatal mixture.

What a singular power is habit! Up to this time Elder Brown had
been entirely innocent of transgression, but with the old alcoholic
fire in his veins, twenty years dropped from his shoulders, and a
feeling came over him familiar to every man who has been “in his
cups.” As a matter of fact, the elder would have been a confirmed
drunkard twenty years before had his wife been less strong-minded.
She took the reins into her own hands when she found that his
business and strong drink did not mix well, worked him into the
church, sustained his resolutions by making it difficult and
dangerous for him to get to his toddy. She became the business head
of the family, and he the spiritual. Only at rare intervals did he
ever “backslide” during the twenty years of the new era, and Mrs.
Brown herself used to say that the “sugar in his’n turned to gall
before the backslide ended.” People who knew her never doubted it.

But Elder Brown’s sin during the remainder of the day contained an
element of responsibility. As he moved majestically down toward
where Balaam slept in the sunlight, he felt no fatigue. There was
a glow upon his cheek-bones, and a faint tinge upon his prominent
nose. He nodded familiarly to people as he met them, and saw not
the look of amusement which succeeded astonishment upon the various
faces. When he reached the neighborhood of Balaam it suddenly
occurred to him that he might have forgotten some one of his
numerous commissions, and he paused to think. Then a brilliant idea
rose in his mind. He would forestall blame and disarm anger with
kindness—he would purchase Hannah a bonnet.

What woman’s heart ever failed to soften at sight of a new bonnet?

As I have stated, the elder was a man of action. He entered a store
near at hand.

“Good-morning,” said an affable gentleman with a Hebrew
countenance, approaching.

“Good-mornin’, good-mornin’,” said the elder, piling his bundles on
the counter. “I hope you are well?” Elder Brown extended his hand
fervidly.

“Quite well, I thank you. What—”

“And the little wife?” said Elder Brown, affectionately retaining
the Jew’s hand.

“Quite well, sir.”

“And the little ones—quite well, I hope, too?”

“Yes, sir; all well, thank you. Something I can do for you?”

The affable merchant was trying to recall his customer’s name.

“Not now, not now, thankee. If you please to let my bundles stay
untell I come back—”

“Can’t I show you something? Hat, coat—”

“Not now. Be back bimeby.”

Was it chance or fate that brought Elder Brown in front of a
bar? The glasses shone bright upon the shelves as the swinging
door flapped back to let out a coatless clerk, who passed him
with a rush, chewing upon a farewell mouthful of brown bread and
bologna. Elder Brown beheld for an instant the familiar scene
within. The screws of his resolution had been loosened. At sight
of the glistening bar the whole moral structure of twenty years
came tumbling down. Mechanically he entered the saloon, and laid a
silver quarter upon the bar as he said:

“A little whiskey an’ sugar.” The arms of the bartender worked like
a faker’s in a side show as he set out the glass with its little
quota of “short sweetening” and a cut-glass decanter, and sent a
half-tumbler of water spinning along from the upper end of the bar
with a dime in change.

“Whiskey is higher’n used to be,” said Elder Brown; but the
bartender was taking another order, and did not hear him. Elder
Brown stirred away the sugar, and let a steady stream of red liquid
flow into the glass. He swallowed the drink as unconcernedly as
though his morning tod had never been suspended, and pocketed the
change. “But it ain’t any better than it was,” he concluded, as
he passed out. He did not even seem to realize that he had done
anything extraordinary.

There was a millinery store up the street, and thither with
uncertain step he wended his way, feeling a little more elate, and
altogether sociable. A pretty, black-eyed girl, struggling to keep
down her mirth, came forward and faced him behind the counter.
Elder Brown lifted his faded hat with the politeness, if not the
grace, of a Castilian, and made a sweeping bow. Again he was in his
element. But he did not speak. A shower of odds and ends, small
packages, thread, needles, and buttons, released from their prison,
rattled down about him.

The girl laughed. She could not help it. And the elder, leaning
his hand on the counter, laughed, too, until several other girls
came half-way to the front. Then they, hiding behind counters and
suspended cloaks, laughed and snickered until they reconvulsed the
elder’s vis-à-vis, who had been making desperate efforts to resume
her demure appearance.

“Let me help you, sir,” she said, coming from behind the counter,
upon seeing Elder Brown beginning to adjust his spectacles for
a search. He waved her back majestically. “No, my dear, no;
can’t allow it. You mout sile them purty fingers. No, ma’am. No
gen’l’man’ll ’low er lady to do such a thing.” The elder was gently
forcing the girl back to her place. “Leave it to me. I’ve picked up
bigger things ’n them. Picked myself up this mornin’. Balaam—you
don’t know Balaam; he’s my donkey—he tumbled me over his head in
the sand this mornin’.” And Elder Brown had to resume an upright
position until his paroxysm of laughter had passed. “You see this
old hat?” extending it, half full of packages; “I fell clear inter
it; jes’ as clean inter it as them things thar fell out’n it.” He
laughed again, and so did the girls. “But, my dear, I whaled half
the hide off’n him for it.”

“Oh, sir! how could you? Indeed, sir. I think you did wrong. The
poor brute did not know what he was doing, I dare say, and probably
he has been a faithful friend.” The girl cast her mischievous
eyes towards her companions, who snickered again. The old man
was not conscious of the sarcasm. He only saw reproach. His face
straightened, and he regarded the girl soberly.

“Mebbe you’re right, my dear; mebbe I oughtn’t.”

“I am sure of it,” said the girl. “But now don’t you want to buy a
bonnet or a cloak to carry home to your wife?”

“Well, you’re whistlin’ now, birdie; that’s my intention; set ’em
all out.” Again the elder’s face shone with delight. “An’ I don’t
want no one-hoss bonnet neither.”

“Of course not. Now here is one; pink silk, with delicate pale
blue feathers. Just the thing for the season. We have nothing
more elegant in stock.” Elder Brown held it out, upside down, at
arm’s-length.

“Well, now, that’s suthin’ like. Will it soot a sorter redheaded
’ooman?”

A perfectly sober man would have said the girl’s corsets must have
undergone a terrible strain, but the elder did not notice her dumb
convulsion. She answered, heroically:

“Perfectly, sir. It is an exquisite match.”

“I think you’re whistlin’ again. Nancy’s head’s red, red as a
woodpeck’s. Sorrel’s only half-way to the color of her top-knot,
an’ it do seem like red oughter to soot red. Nancy’s red an’ the
hat’s red; like goes with like, an’ birds of a feather flock
together.” The old man laughed until his cheeks were wet.

The girl, beginning to feel a little uneasy, and seeing a customer
entering, rapidly fixed up the bonnet, took fifteen dollars out
of a twenty-dollar bill, and calmly asked the elder if he wanted
anything else. He thrust his change somewhere into his clothes, and
beat a retreat. It had occurred to him that he was nearly drunk.

Elder Brown’s step began to lose its buoyancy. He found himself
utterly unable to walk straight. There was an uncertain straddle in
his gait that carried him from one side of the walk to the other,
and caused people whom he met to cheerfully yield him plenty of
room.

Balaam saw him coming. Poor Balaam. He had made an early start that
day, and for hours he stood in the sun awaiting relief. When he
opened his sleepy eyes and raised his expressive ears to a position
of attention, the old familiar coat and battered hat of the elder
were before him. He lifted up his honest voice and cried aloud for
joy.

The effect was electrical for one instant. Elder Brown surveyed the
beast with horror, but again in his understanding there rang out
the trumpet words.

“Drunk, drunk, drunk, drer-unc, -er-unc, -unc, -unc.”

He stooped instinctively for a missile with which to smite his
accuser, but brought up suddenly with a jerk and a handful of sand.
Straightening himself up with a majestic dignity, he extended his
right hand impressively.

“You’re a goldarn liar, Balaam, and, blast your old buttons, you
kin walk home by yourself, for I’m danged if you sh’ll ride me er
step.”

Surely Coriolanus never turned his back upon Rome with a grander
dignity than sat upon the old man’s form as he faced about and left
the brute to survey with anxious eyes the new departure of his
master.

He saw the elder zigzag along the street, and beheld him about to
turn a friendly corner. Once more he lifted up his mighty voice:

“Drunk, drunk, drunk, drer-unc, drer-unc, -erunc, -unc, -unc.”

Once more the elder turned with lifted hand and shouted back:

“You’re a liar, Balaam, goldarn you! You’re er iffamous liar.” Then
he passed from view.


III

Mrs. Brown stood upon the steps anxiously awaiting the return of
her liege lord. She knew he had with him a large sum of money, or
should have, and she knew also that he was a man without business
methods. She had long since repented of the decision which sent him
to town. When the old battered hat and flour-covered coat loomed
up in the gloaming and confronted her, she stared with terror. The
next instant she had seized him.

“For the Lord sakes, Elder Brown, what ails you? As I live, if the
man ain’t drunk! Elder Brown! Elder Brown! for the life of me can’t
I make you hear? You crazy old hypocrite! you desavin’ old sinner!
you black-hearted wretch! where have you ben?”

The elder made an effort to wave her off.

“Woman,” he said, with grand dignity, “you forgit yus-sef; shu
know ware I’ve ben ’swell’s I do. Ben to town, wife, an’ see yer
wat I’ve brought—the fines’ hat, ole woman, I could git. Look’t
the color. Like goes ’ith like; it’s red an’ you’re red, an’
it’s a dead match. What yer mean? Hey! hole on! ole woman!—you!
Hannah!—you.” She literally shook him into silence.

“You miserable wretch! you low-down drunken sot! what do you mean
by coming home and insulting your wife?” Hannah ceased shaking him
from pure exhaustion.

“Where is it, I say? where is it?”

By this time she was turning his pockets wrong side out. From one
she got pills, from another change, from another packages.

“The Lord be praised, and this is better luck than I hoped! Oh,
elder! elder! elder! what did you do it for? Why, man, where is
Balaam?”

Thought of the beast choked off the threatened hysterics.

“Balaam? Balaam?” said the elder, groggily. “He’s in town. The
infernal ole fool ’sulted me, an’ I lef’ him to walk home.”

His wife surveyed him. Really at that moment she did think his mind
was gone; but the leer upon the old man’s face enraged her beyond
endurance.

“You did, did you? Well, now, I reckon you’ll laugh for some cause,
you will. Back you go, sir—straight back; an’ don’t you come home
’thout that donkey, or you’ll rue it, sure as my name is Hannah
Brown. Aleck!—you Aleck-k-k!”

A black boy darted round the corner, from behind which, with
several others, he had beheld the brief but stirring scene.

“Put a saddle on er mule. The elder’s gwine back to town. And don’t
you be long about it neither.”

“Yessum.” Aleck’s ivories gleamed in the darkness as he disappeared.

Elder Brown was soberer at that moment than he had been for hours.

“Hannah, you don’t mean it?”

“Yes, sir, I do. Back you go to town as sure as my name is Hannah
Brown.”

The elder was silent. He had never known his wife to relent on any
occasion after she had affirmed her intention, supplemented with
“as sure as my name is Hannah Brown.” It was her way of swearing.
No affidavit would have had half the claim upon her as that simple
enunciation.

So back to town went Elder Brown, not in the order of the early
morn, but silently, moodily, despairingly, surrounded by mental and
actual gloom.

The old man had turned a last appealing glance upon the angry
woman, as he mounted with Aleck’s assistance, and sat in the light
that streamed from out the kitchen window. She met the glance
without a waver.

“She means it, as sure as my name is Elder Brown,” he said,
thickly. Then he rode on.


IV

To say that Elder Brown suffered on this long journey back to Macon
would only mildly outline his experience. His early morning’s fall
had begun to make itself felt. He was sore and uncomfortable.
Besides, his stomach was empty, and called for two meals it had
missed for the first time in years.

When, sore and weary, the elder entered the city, the electric
lights shone above it like jewels in a crown. The city slept;
that is, the better portion of it did. Here and there, however,
the lower lights flashed out into the night. Moodily the elder
pursued his journey, and as he rode, far off in the night there
rose and quivered a plaintive cry. Elder Brown smiled wearily:
it was Balaam’s appeal, and he recognized it. The animal he rode
also recognized it, and replied, until the silence of the city was
destroyed. The odd clamor and confusion drew from a saloon near by
a group of noisy youngsters, who had been making a night of it.
They surrounded Elder Brown as he began to transfer himself to
the hungry beast to whose motion he was more accustomed, and in
the “hail fellow well met” style of the day began to bandy jests
upon his appearance. Now Elder Brown was not in a jesting humor.
Positively he was in the worst humor possible. The result was that
before many minutes passed the old man was swinging several of
the crowd by their collars, and breaking the peace of the city.
A policeman approached, and but for the good-humored party, upon
whom the elder’s pluck had made a favorable impression, would have
run the old man into the barracks. The crowd, however, drew him
laughingly into the saloon and to the bar. The reaction was too
much for his half-rallied senses. He yielded again. The reviving
liquor passed his lips. Gloom vanished. He became one of the boys.

The company into which Elder Brown had fallen was what is known as
“first-class.” To such nothing is so captivating as an adventure
out of the common run of accidents. The gaunt countryman, with his
battered hat and clawhammer coat, was a prize of an extraordinary
nature. They drew him into a rear room, whose gilded frames and
polished tables betrayed the character and purpose of the place,
and plied him with wine until ten thousand lights danced about him.
The fun increased. One youngster made a political speech from the
top of the table; another impersonated Hamlet; and finally Elder
Brown was lifted into a chair, and sang a camp-meeting song. This
was rendered by him with startling effect. He stood upright, with
his hat jauntily knocked to one side, and his coat tails ornamented
with a couple of show-bills, kindly pinned on by his admirers. In
his left hand he waved the stub of a cigar, and on his back was an
admirable representation of Balaam’s head, executed by some artist
with billiard chalk.

As the elder sang his favorite hymn, “I’m glad salvation’s free,”
his stentorian voice awoke the echoes. Most of the company rolled
upon the floor in convulsions of laughter.

The exhibition came to a close by the chair overturning. Again
Elder Brown fell into his beloved hat. He arose and shouted:
“Whoa, Balaam!” Again he seized the nearest weapon, and sought
satisfaction. The young gentleman with political sentiments was
knocked under the table, and Hamlet only escaped injury by beating
the infuriated elder into the street.

What next? Well, I hardly know. How the elder found Balaam is a
mystery yet: not that Balaam was hard to find, but that the old man
was in no condition to find anything. Still he did, and climbing
laboriously into the saddle, he held on stupidly while the hungry
beast struck out for home.


V

Hannah Brown did not sleep that night. Sleep would not come. Hour
after hour passed, and her wrath refused to be quelled. She tried
every conceivable method, but time hung heavily. It was not quite
peep of day, however, when she laid her well-worn family Bible
aside. It had been her mother’s, and amid all the anxieties and
tribulations incident to the life of a woman who had free negroes
and a miserable husband to manage, it had been her mainstay and
comfort. She had frequently read it in anger, page after page,
without knowing what was contained in the lines. But eventually the
words became intelligible and took meaning. She wrested consolation
from it by mere force of will.

And so on this occasion when she closed the book the fierce anger
was gone.

She was not a hard woman naturally. Fate had brought her conditions
which covered up the woman heart within her, but though it lay
deep, it was there still. As she sat with folded hands her eyes
fell upon—what?

The pink bonnet with the blue plume!

It may appear strange to those who do not understand such natures,
but to me her next action was perfectly natural. She burst into a
convulsive laugh; then, seizing the queer object, bent her face
upon it and sobbed hysterically. When the storm was over, very
tenderly she laid the gift aside, and bareheaded passed out into
the night.

For a half-hour she stood at the end of the lane, and then hungry
Balaam and his master hove in sight. Reaching out her hand, she
checked the beast.

“William,” said she, very gently, “where is the mule?”

The elder had been asleep. He woke and gazed upon her blankly.

“What mule, Hannah?”

“The mule you rode to town.”

For one full minute the elder studied her face. Then it burst from
his lips:

“Well, bless me! if I didn’t bring Balaam and forgit the mule!”

The woman laughed till her eyes ran water.

“William,” said she, “you’re drunk.”

“Hannah,” said he, meekly, “I know it. The truth is, Hannah, I—”

“Never mind, now, William,” she said, gently. “You are tired and
hungry. Come into the house, husband.”

Leading Balaam, she disappeared down the lane; and when, a few
minutes later, Hannah Brown and her husband entered through the
light that streamed out of the open door her arms were around him,
and her face upturned to his.

THE HOTEL EXPERIENCE OF MR. PINK FLUKER[20]

BY RICHARD MALCOLM JOHNSTON (1822–1898)


I

Mr. Peterson Fluker, generally called Pink, for his fondness for
as stylish dressing as he could afford, was one of that sort of
men who habitually seem busy and efficient when they are not. He
had the bustling activity often noticeable in men of his size, and
in one way and another had made up, as he believed, for being so
much smaller than most of his adult acquaintance of the male sex.
Prominent among his achievements on that line was getting married
to a woman who, among other excellent gifts, had that of being
twice as big as her husband.

“Fool who?” on the day after his marriage he had asked, with a look
at those who had often said that he was too little to have a wife.

They had a little property to begin with, a couple of hundreds of
acres, and two or three negroes apiece. Yet, except in the natural
increase of the latter, the accretions of worldly estate had been
inconsiderable till now, when their oldest child, Marann, was some
fifteen years old. These accretions had been saved and taken care
of by Mrs. Fluker, who was as staid and silent as he was mobile and
voluble.

Mr. Fluker often said that it puzzled him how it was that he made
smaller crops than most of his neighbors, when, if not always
convincing, he could generally put every one of them to silence in
discussions upon agricultural topics. This puzzle had led him to
not unfrequent ruminations in his mind as to whether or not his
vocation might lie in something higher than the mere tilling of the
ground. These ruminations had lately taken a definite direction,
and it was after several conversations which he had held with his
friend Matt Pike.

Mr. Matt Pike was a bachelor of some thirty summers, a foretime
clerk consecutively in each of the two stores of the village, but
latterly a trader on a limited scale in horses, wagons, cows, and
similar objects of commerce, and at all times a politician. His
hopes of holding office had been continually disappointed until
Mr. John Sanks became sheriff, and rewarded with a deputyship some
important special service rendered by him in the late very close
canvass. Now was a chance to rise, Mr. Pike thought. All he wanted,
he had often said, was a start. Politics, I would remark, however,
had been regarded by Mr. Pike as a means rather than an end. It
is doubtful if he hoped to become governor of the state, at least
before an advanced period in his career. His main object now was to
get money, and he believed that official position would promote him
in the line of his ambition faster than was possible to any private
station, by leading him into more extensive acquaintance with
mankind, their needs, their desires, and their caprices. A deputy
sheriff, provided that lawyers were not too indulgent in allowing
acknowledgment of service of court processes, in postponing levies
and sales, and in settlement of litigated cases, might pick up
three hundred dollars, a good sum for those times, a fact which Mr.
Pike had known and pondered long.

It happened just about then that the arrears of rent for the
village hotel had so accumulated on Mr. Spouter, the last occupant,
that the owner, an indulgent man, finally had said, what he had
been expected for years and years to say, that he could not wait
on Mr. Spouter forever and eternally. It was at this very nick, so
to speak, that Mr. Pike made to Mr. Fluker the suggestion to quit
a business so far beneath his powers, sell out, or rent out, or
tenant out, or do something else with his farm, march into town,
plant himself upon the ruins of Jacob Spouter, and begin his upward
soar.

Now Mr. Fluker had many and many a time acknowledged that he had
ambition; so one night he said to his wife:

“You see how it is here, Nervy. Farmin’ somehow don’t suit my
talons. I need to be flung more ’mong people to fetch out what’s
in me. Then thar’s Marann, which is gittin’ to be nigh on to a
growd-up woman; an’ the child need the s’iety which you ’bleeged to
acknowledge is sca’ce about here, six mile from town. Your brer Sam
can stay here an’ raise butter, chickens, eggs, pigs, an’—an’—an’
so forth. Matt Pike say he jes’ know they’s money in it, an’
special with a housekeeper keerful an’ equinomical like you.”

It is always curious the extent of influence that some men have
upon wives who are their superiors. Mrs. Fluker, in spite of
accidents, had ever set upon her husband a value that was not
recognized outside of his family. In this respect there seems a
surprising compensation in human life. But this remark I make only
in passing. Mrs. Fluker, admitting in her heart that farming was
not her husband’s forte, hoped, like a true wife, that it might be
found in the new field to which he aspired. Besides, she did not
forget that her brother Sam had said to her several times privately
that if his brer Pink wouldn’t have so many notions and would
let him alone in his management, they would all do better. She
reflected for a day or two, and then said:

“Maybe it’s best, Mr. Fluker. I’m willin’ to try it for a year,
anyhow. We can’t lose much by that. As for Matt Pike, I hain’t the
confidence in him you has. Still, he bein’ a boarder and deputy
sheriff, he might accidentally do us some good. I’ll try it for a
year providin’ you’ll fetch me the money as it’s paid in, for you
know I know how to manage that better’n you do, and you know I’ll
try to manage it and all the rest of the business for the best.”

To this provision Mr. Fluker gave consent, qualified by the claim
that he was to retain a small margin for indispensable personal
exigencies. For he contended, perhaps with justice, that no man in
the responsible position he was about to take ought to be expected
to go about, or sit about, or even lounge about, without even a
continental red in his pocket.

The new house—I say _new_ because tongue could not tell the amount
of scouring, scalding, and whitewashing that that excellent
housekeeper had done before a single stick of her furniture went
into it—the new house, I repeat, opened with six eating boarders at
ten dollars a month apiece, and two eating and sleeping at eleven,
besides Mr. Pike, who made a special contract. Transient custom
was hoped to hold its own, and that of the county people under the
deputy’s patronage and influence to be considerably enlarged.

In words and other encouragement Mr. Pike was pronounced. He could
commend honestly, and he did so cordially.

“The thing to do, Pink, is to have your prices reg’lar, and make
people pay up reg’lar. Ten dollars for eatin’, jes’ so; eleb’n for
eatin’ _an_’ sleepin’; half a dollar for dinner, jes’ so; quarter
apiece for breakfast, supper, and bed, is what I call reason’ble
bo’d. As for me, I sca’cely know how to rig’late, because, you
know, I’m a’ officer now, an’ in course I natchel _has_ to be away
sometimes an’ on expenses at ’tother places, an’ it seem like some
’lowance ought by good rights to be made for that; don’t you think
so?”

“Why, matter o’ course, Matt; what you think? I ain’t so powerful
good at figgers. Nervy is. S’posen you speak to her ’bout it.”

“Oh, that’s perfec’ unuseless, Pink. I’m a’ officer o’ the law,
Pink, an’ the law consider women—well, I may say the law, _she_
deal ’ith _men_, not women, an’ she expect her officers to
understan’ figgers, an’ if I hadn’t o’ understood figgers Mr. Sanks
wouldn’t or darsnt’ to ’p’int me his dep’ty. Me ’n’ you can fix
them terms. Now see here, reg’lar bo’d—eatin’ bo’d, I mean—is ten
dollars, an’ sleepin’ and singuil meals is ’cordin’ to the figgers
you’ve sot for ’em. Ain’t that so? Jes’ so. Now, Pink, you an’
me’ll keep a runnin’ account, you a-chargin’ for reg’lar bo’d,
an’ I a’lowin’ to myself credics for my absentees, accordin’ to
transion customers an’ singuil mealers an’ sleepers. Is that fa’r,
er is it not fa’r?”

Mr. Fluker turned his head, and after making or thinking he had
made a calculation, answered:

“That’s—that seem fa’r, Matt.”

“Cert’nly ’tis, Pink; I knowed you’d say so, an’ you know I’d never
wish to be nothin’ but fa’r ’ith people I like, like I do you an’
your wife. Let that be the understandin’, then, betwix’ us. An’
Pink, let the understandin’ be jes’ betwix’ _us_, for I’ve saw
enough o’ this world to find out that a man never makes nothin’
by makin’ a blowin’ horn o’ his business. You make the t’others
pay up spuntial, monthly. You ’n’ me can settle whensomever it’s
convenant, say three months from to-day. In course I shall talk up
for the house whensomever and wharsomever I go or stay. You know
that. An’ as for my bed,” said Mr. Pike finally, “whensomever I
ain’t here by bed-time, you welcome to put any transion person in
it, an’ also an’ likewise, when transion custom is pressin’, and
you cramped for beddin’, I’m willin’ to give it up for the time
bein’; an’ rather’n you should be cramped too bad, I’ll take my
chances somewhars else, even if I has to take a pallet at the head
o’ the sta’r-steps.”

“Nervy,” said Mr. Fluker to his wife afterwards, “Matt Pike’s a
sensibler an’ a friendlier an’ a ’commodatiner feller’n I thought.”

Then, without giving details of the contract, he mentioned merely
the willingness of their boarder to resign his bed on occasions of
pressing emergency.

“He’s talked mighty fine to me and Marann,” answered Mrs. Fluker.
“We’ll see how he holds out. One thing I do not like of his doin’,
an’ that’s the talkin’ ’bout Sim Marchman to Marann, an’ makin’
game o’ his country ways, as he call ’em. Sech as that ain’t right.”

It may be as well to explain just here that Simeon Marchman, the
person just named by Mrs. Fluker, a stout, industrious young
farmer, residing with his parents in the country near by where the
Flukers had dwelt before removing to town, had been eying Marann
for a year or two, and waiting upon her fast-ripening womanhood
with intentions that, he believed to be hidden in his own breast,
though he had taken less pains to conceal them from Marann than
from the rest of his acquaintance. Not that he had ever told her of
them in so many words, but—Oh, I need not stop here in the midst
of this narration to explain how such intentions become known, or
at least strongly suspected by girls, even those less bright than
Marann Fluker. Simeon had not cordially indorsed the movement into
town, though, of course, knowing it was none of his business, he
had never so much as hinted opposition. I would not be surprised,
also, if he reflected that there might be some selfishness in his
hostility, or at least that it was heightened by apprehensions
personal to himself.

Considering the want of experience in the new tenants, matters went
on remarkably well. Mrs. Fluker, accustomed to rise from her couch
long before the lark, managed to the satisfaction of all,—regular
boarders, single-meal takers, and transient people. Marann went
to the village school, her mother dressing her, though with
prudent economy, as neatly and almost as tastefully as any of her
schoolmates; while, as to study, deportment, and general progress,
there was not a girl in the whole school to beat her, I don’t care
who she was.


II

During a not inconsiderable period Mr. Fluker indulged the
honorable conviction that at last he had found the vein in which
his best talents lay, and he was happy in foresight of the
prosperity and felicity which that discovery promised to himself
and his family. His native activity found many more objects for
its exertion than before. He rode out to the farm, not often, but
sometimes, as a matter of duty, and was forced to acknowledge
that Sam was managing better than could have been expected in the
absence of his own continuous guidance. In town he walked about
the hotel, entertained the guests, carved at the meals, hovered
about the stores, the doctors’ offices, the wagon and blacksmith
shops, discussed mercantile, medical, mechanical questions with
specialists in all these departments, throwing into them all more
and more of politics as the intimacy between him and his patron and
chief boarder increased.

Now as to that patron and chief boarder. The need of extending his
acquaintance seemed to press upon Mr. Pike with ever-increasing
weight. He was here and there, all over the county; at the
county-seat, at the county villages, at justices’ courts, at
executors’ and administrators’ sales, at quarterly and protracted
religious meetings, at barbecues of every dimension, on hunting
excursions and fishing frolics, at social parties in all
neighborhoods. It got to be said of Mr. Pike that a freer acceptor
of hospitable invitations, or a better appreciator of hospitable
intentions, was not and needed not to be found possibly in the
whole state. Nor was this admirable deportment confined to the
county in which he held so high official position. He attended,
among other occasions less public, the spring sessions of the
supreme and county courts in the four adjoining counties: the guest
of acquaintance old and new over there. When starting upon such
travels, he would sometimes breakfast with his traveling companion
in the village, and, if somewhat belated in the return, sup with
him also.

Yet, when at Flukers’, no man could have been a more cheerful and
otherwise satisfactory boarder than Mr. Matt Pike. He praised every
dish set before him, bragged to their very faces of his host and
hostess, and in spite of his absences was the oftenest to sit and
chat with Marann when her mother would let her go into the parlor.
Here and everywhere about the house, in the dining-room, in the
passage, at the foot of the stairs, he would joke with Marann about
her country beau, as he styled poor Sim Marchman, and he would talk
as though he was rather ashamed of Sim, and wanted Marann to string
her bow for higher game.

Brer Sam did manage well, not only the fields, but the yard. Every
Saturday of the world he sent in something or other to his sister.
I don’t know whether I ought to tell it or not, but for the sake of
what is due to pure veracity I will. On as many as three different
occasions Sim Marchman, as if he had lost all self-respect, or had
not a particle of tact, brought in himself, instead of sending by a
negro, a bucket of butter and a coop of spring chickens as a free
gift to Mrs. Fluker. I do think, on my soul, that Mr. Matt Pike
was much amused by such degradation—however, he must say that they
were all first-rate. As for Marann, she was very sorry for Sim, and
wished he had not brought these good things at all.

Nobody knew how it came about; but when the Flukers had been in
town somewhere between two and three months, Sim Marchman, who (to
use his own words) had never bothered her a great deal with his
visits, began to suspect that what few he made were received by
Marann lately with less cordiality than before; and so one day,
knowing no better, in his awkward, straightforward country manners,
he wanted to know the reason why. Then Marann grew distant, and
asked Sim the following question:

“You know where Mr. Pike’s gone, Mr. Marchman?”

Now the fact was, and she knew it, that Marann Fluker had never
before, not since she was born, addressed that boy as _Mister_.

The visitor’s face reddened and reddened.

“No,” he faltered in answer; “no—no—_ma’am_, I should say. I—I
don’t know where Mr. Pike’s gone.”

Then he looked around for his hat, discovered it in time, took it
into his hands, turned it around two or three times, then, bidding
good-bye without shaking hands, took himself off.

Mrs. Fluker liked all the Marchmans, and she was troubled somewhat
when she heard of the quickness and manner of Sim’s departure; for
he had been fully expected by her to stay to dinner.

“Say he didn’t even shake hands, Marann? What for? What you do to
him?”

“Not one blessed thing, ma; only he wanted to know why I wasn’t
gladder to see him.” Then Marann looked indignant.

“Say them words, Marann?”

“No, but he hinted ’em.”

“What did you say then?”

“I just asked, a-meaning nothing in the wide world, ma—I asked him
if he knew where Mr. Pike had gone.”

“And that were answer enough to hurt his feelin’s. What you want to
know where Matt Pike’s gone for, Marann?”

“I didn’t care about knowing, ma, but I didn’t like the way Sim
talked.”

“Look here, Marann. Look straight at me. You’ll be mighty fur
off your feet if you let Matt Pike put things in your head that
hain’t no business a-bein’ there, and special if you find yourself
a-wantin’ to know where he’s a-perambulatin’ in his everlastin’
meanderin’s. Not a cent has he paid for his board, and which your
pa say he have a’ understandin’ with him about allowin’ for his
absentees, which is all right enough, but which it’s now goin’ on
to three mont’s, and what is comin’ to us I need and I want. He
ought, your pa ought to let me bargain with Matt Pike, because he
know he don’t understan’ figgers like Matt Pike. He don’t know
exactly what the bargain were; for I’ve asked him, and he always
begins with a multiplyin’ of words and never answers me.”

On his next return from his travels Mr. Pike noticed a coldness
in Mrs. Fluker’s manner, and this enhanced his praise of the
house. The last week of the third month came. Mr. Pike was often
noticed, before and after meals, standing at the desk in the hotel
office (called in those times the bar-room) engaged in making
calculations. The day before the contract expired Mrs. Fluker,
who had not indulged herself with a single holiday since they had
been in town, left Marann in charge of the house, and rode forth,
spending part of the day with Mrs. Marchman, Sim’s mother. All were
glad to see her, of course, and she returned smartly, freshened
by the visit. That night she had a talk with Marann, and oh, how
Marann did cry!

The very last day came. Like insurance policies, the contract was
to expire at a certain hour. Sim Marchman came just before dinner,
to which he was sent for by Mrs. Fluker, who had seen him as he
rode into town.

“Hello, Sim,” said Mr. Pike as he took his seat opposite him. “You
here? What’s the news in the country? How’s your health? How’s
crops?”

“Jest mod’rate, Mr. Pike. Got little business with you after
dinner, ef you can spare time.”

“All right. Got a little matter with Pink here first. ’Twon’t take
long. See you arfter amejiant, Sim.”

Never had the deputy been more gracious and witty. He talked and
talked, outtalking even Mr. Fluker; he was the only man in town who
could do that. He winked at Marann as he put questions to Sim, some
of the words employed in which Sim had never heard before. Yet Sim
held up as well as he could, and after dinner followed Marann with
some little dignity into the parlor. They had not been there more
than ten minutes when Mrs. Fluker was heard to walk rapidly along
the passage leading from the dining-room, to enter her own chamber
for only a moment, then to come out and rush to the parlor door
with the gig-whip in her hand. Such uncommon conduct in a woman
like Mrs. Pink Fluker of course needs explanation.

When all the other boarders had left the house, the deputy and Mr.
Fluker having repaired to the bar-room, the former said:

“Now, Pink, for our settlement, as you say your wife think we
better have one. I’d ’a’ been willin’ to let accounts keep on
a-runnin’, knowin’ what a straightforrards sort o’ man you was.
Your count, ef I ain’t mistakened, is jes’ thirty-three dollars,
even money. Is that so, or is it not?”

“That’s it, to a dollar, Matt. Three times eleben make
thirty-three, don’t it?”

“It do, Pink, or eleben times three, jes’ which you please. Now
here’s my count, on which you’ll see, Pink, that not nary cent have
I charged for infloonce. I has infloonced a consider’ble custom
to this house, as you know, bo’din’ and transion. But I done that
out o’ my respects of you an’ Missis Fluker, an’ your keepin’ of a
fa’r—I’ll say, as I’ve said freckwent, a _very_ fa’r house. I let
them infloonces go to friendship, ef you’ll take it so. Will you,
Pink Fluker?”

“Cert’nly, Matt, an’ I’m a thousand times obleeged to you, an’—”

“Say no more, Pink, on that p’int o’ view. Ef I like a man, I know
how to treat him. Now as to the p’ints o’ absentees, my business
as dep’ty sheriff has took me away from this inconsider’ble town
freckwent, hain’t it?”

“It have, Matt, er somethin’ else, more’n I were a expectin’, an’—”

“Jes’ so. But a public officer, Pink, when jooty call on him to go,
he got to go; in fack he got to _goth_, as the Scripture say, ain’t
that so?”

“I s’pose so, Matt, by good rights, a—a official speakin’.”

Mr. Fluker felt that he was becoming a little confused.

“Jes’ so. Now, Pink, I were to have credics for my absentees
’cordin’ to transion an’ single-meal bo’ders an’ sleepers; ain’t
that so?”

“I—I—somethin’ o’ that sort, Matt,” he answered vaguely.

“Jes’ so. Now look here,” drawing from his pocket a paper. “Itom
one. Twenty-eight dinners at half a dollar makes fourteen dollars,
don’t it? Jes’ so. Twenty-five breakfasts at a quarter makes six
an’ a quarter, which make dinners an’ breakfasts twenty an’ a
quarter. Foller me up, as I go up, Pink. Twenty-five suppers at a
quarter makes six an’ a quarter, an’ which them added to the twenty
an’ a quarter makes them twenty-six an’ a half. Foller, Pink, an’
if you ketch me in any mistakes in the kyarin’ an’ addin’, p’int it
out. Twenty-two an’ a half beds—an’ I say _half_, Pink, because you
’member one night when them A’gusty lawyers got here ’bout midnight
on their way to co’t, rather’n have you too bad cramped, I ris to
make way for two of ’em; yit as I had one good nap, I didn’t think
I ought to put that down but for half. Them makes five dollars half
an’ seb’n pence, an’ which kyar’d on to the t’other twenty-six an’
a half, fetches the whole cabool to jes’ thirty-two dollars an’
seb’n pence. But I made up my mind I’d fling out that seb’n pence,
an’ jes’ call it a dollar even money, an’ which here’s the solid
silver.”

In spite of the rapidity with which this enumeration of
counter-charges was made, Mr. Fluker commenced perspiring at the
first item, and when the balance was announced his face was covered
with huge drops.

It was at this juncture that Mrs. Fluker, who, well knowing her
husband’s unfamiliarity with complicated accounts, had felt her
duty to be listening near the bar-room door, left, and quickly
afterwards appeared before Marann and Sim as I have represented.

“You think Matt Pike ain’t tryin’ to settle with your pa with a
dollar? I’m goin’ to make him keep his dollar, an’ I’m goin’ to
give him somethin’ to go ’long with it.”

“The good Lord have mercy upon us!” exclaimed Marann, springing up
and catching hold of her mother’s skirts, as she began her advance
towards the bar-room. “Oh, ma! for the Lord’s sake!—Sim, Sim, Sim,
if you care _any_thing for me in this wide world, don’t let ma go
into that room!”

“Missis Fluker,” said Sim, rising instantly, “wait jest two minutes
till I see Mr. Pike on some pressin’ business; I won’t keep you
over two minutes a-waitin’.”

He took her, set her down in a chair trembling, looked at her a
moment as she began to weep, then, going out and closing the door,
strode rapidly to the bar-room.

“Let me help you settle your board-bill, Mr. Pike, by payin’ you a
little one I owe you.”

Doubling his fist, he struck out with a blow that felled the deputy
to the floor. Then catching him by his heels, he dragged him out of
the house into the street. Lifting his foot above his face, he said:

“You stir till I tell you, an’ I’ll stomp your nose down even
with the balance of your mean face. ’Tain’t exactly my business
how you cheated Mr. Fluker, though, ’pon my soul, I never knowed
a trifliner, lowdowner trick. But _I_ owed you myself for your
talkin’ ’bout and your lyin’ ’bout me, and now I’ve paid you; an’
ef you only knowed it, I’ve saved you from a gig-whippin’. Now you
may git up.”

“Here’s his dollar, Sim,” said Mr. Fluker, throwing it out of the
window. “Nervy say make him take it.”

The vanquished, not daring to refuse, pocketed the coin, and slunk
away amid the jeers of a score of villagers who had been drawn to
the scene.

In all human probability the late omission of the shaking of Sim’s
and Marann’s hands was compensated at their parting that afternoon.
I am more confident on this point because at the end of the year
those hands were joined inseparably by the preacher. But this was
when they had all gone back to their old home; for if Mr. Fluker
did not become fully convinced that his mathematical education was
not advanced quite enough for all the exigencies of hotel-keeping,
his wife declared that she had had enough of it, and that she and
Marann were going home. Mr. Fluker may be said, therefore, to have
followed, rather than led, his family on the return.

As for the deputy, finding that if he did not leave it voluntarily
he would be drummed out of the village, he departed, whither I do
not remember if anybody ever knew.

THE NICE PEOPLE[21]

By Henry Cuyler Bunner (1855–1896)


“They certainly are nice people,” I assented to my wife’s
observation, using the colloquial phrase with a consciousness that
it was anything but “nice” English, “and I’ll bet that their three
children are better brought up than most of——”

“_Two_ children,” corrected my wife.

“Three, he told me.”

“My dear, she said there were _two_.”

“He said three.”

“You’ve simply forgotten. I’m _sure_ she told me they had only
two—a boy and a girl.”

“Well, I didn’t enter into particulars.”

“No, dear, and you couldn’t have understood him. Two children.”

“All right,” I said; but I did not think it was all right. As a
nearsighted man learns by enforced observation to recognize persons
at a distance when the face is not visible to the normal eye, so
the man with a bad memory learns, almost unconsciously, to listen
carefully and report accurately. My memory is bad; but I had
not had time to forget that Mr. Brewster Brede had told me that
afternoon that he had three children, at present left in the care
of his mother-in-law, while he and Mrs. Brede took their summer
vacation.

“Two children,” repeated my wife; “and they are staying with his
aunt Jenny.”

“He told me with his mother-in-law,” I put in. My wife looked at me
with a serious expression. Men may not remember much of what they
are told about children; but any man knows the difference between
an aunt and a mother-in-law.

“But don’t you think they’re nice people?” asked my wife.

“Oh, certainly,” I replied. “Only they seem to be a little mixed up
about their children.”

“That isn’t a nice thing to say,” returned my wife. I could not
deny it.

       *       *       *       *       *

And yet, the next morning, when the Bredes came down and seated
themselves opposite us at table, beaming and smiling in their
natural, pleasant, well-bred fashion, I knew, to a social
certainty, that they were “nice” people. He was a fine-looking
fellow in his neat tennis-flannels, slim, graceful, twenty-eight or
thirty years old, with a Frenchy pointed beard. She was “nice” in
all her pretty clothes, and she herself was pretty with that type
of prettiness which outwears most other types—the prettiness that
lies in a rounded figure, a dusky skin, plump, rosy cheeks, white
teeth and black eyes. She might have been twenty-five; you guessed
that she was prettier than she was at twenty, and that she would be
prettier still at forty.

And nice people were all we wanted to make us happy in Mr.
Jacobus’s summer boarding-house on top of Orange Mountain. For a
week we had come down to breakfast each morning, wondering why we
wasted the precious days of idleness with the company gathered
around the Jacobus board. What joy of human companionship was to
be had out of Mrs. Tabb and Miss Hoogencamp, the two middle-aged
gossips from Scranton, Pa.—out of Mr. and Mrs. Biggle, an indurated
head-bookkeeper and his prim and censorious wife—out of old Major
Halkit, a retired business man, who, having once sold a few shares
on commission, wrote for circulars of every stock company that was
started, and tried to induce every one to invest who would listen
to him? We looked around at those dull faces, the truthful indices
of mean and barren minds, and decided that we would leave that
morning. Then we ate Mrs. Jacobus’s biscuit, light as Aurora’s
cloudlets, drank her honest coffee, inhaled the perfume of the late
azaleas with which she decked her table, and decided to postpone
our departure one more day. And then we wandered out to take our
morning glance at what we called “our view”; and it seemed to us as
if Tabb and Hoogencamp and Halkit and the Biggleses could not drive
us away in a year.

I was not surprised when, after breakfast, my wife
invited the Bredes to walk with us to “our view.” The
Hoogencamp-Biggle-Tabb-Halkit contingent never stirred off
Jacobus’s veranda; but we both felt that the Bredes would not
profane that sacred scene. We strolled slowly across the fields,
passed through the little belt of woods and, as I heard Mrs.
Brede’s little cry of startled rapture, I motioned to Brede to look
up.

“By Jove!” he cried, “heavenly!”

We looked off from the brow of the mountain over fifteen miles
of billowing green, to where, far across a far stretch of pale
blue lay a dim purple line that we knew was Staten Island. Towns
and villages lay before us and under us; there were ridges and
hills, uplands and lowlands, woods and plains, all massed and
mingled in that great silent sea of sunlit green. For silent it
was to us, standing in the silence of a high place—silent with a
Sunday stillness that made us listen, without taking thought, for
the sound of bells coming up from the spires that rose above the
tree-tops—the tree-tops that lay as far beneath us as the light
clouds were above us that dropped great shadows upon our heads
and faint specks of shade upon the broad sweep of land at the
mountain’s foot.

“And so that is _your_ view?” asked Mrs. Brede, after a moment;
“you are very generous to make it ours, too.”

Then we lay down on the grass, and Brede began to talk, in a gentle
voice, as if he felt the influence of the place. He had paddled a
canoe, in his earlier days, he said, and he knew every river and
creek in that vast stretch of landscape. He found his landmarks,
and pointed out to us where the Passaic and the Hackensack flowed,
invisible to us, hidden behind great ridges that in our sight were
but combings of the green waves upon which we looked down. And yet,
on the further side of those broad ridges and rises were scores of
villages—a little world of country life, lying unseen under our
eyes.

“A good deal like looking at humanity,” he said; “there is such a
thing as getting so far above our fellow men that we see only one
side of them.”

Ah, how much better was this sort of talk than the chatter
and gossip of the Tabb and the Hoogencamp—than the Major’s
dissertations upon his everlasting circulars! My wife and I
exchanged glances.

“Now, when I went up the Matterhorn” Mr. Brede began.

“Why, dear,” interrupted his wife, “I didn’t know you ever went up
the Matterhorn.”

“It—it was five years ago,” said Mr. Brede, hurriedly. “I—I didn’t
tell you—when I was on the other side, you know—it was rather
dangerous—well, as I was saying—it looked—oh, it didn’t look at all
like this.”

A cloud floated overhead, throwing its great shadow over the field
where we lay. The shadow passed over the mountain’s brow and
reappeared far below, a rapidly decreasing blot, flying eastward
over the golden green. My wife and I exchanged glances once more.

Somehow, the shadow lingered over us all. As we went home, the
Bredes went side by side along the narrow path, and my wife and I
walked together.

“_Should you think_,” she asked me, “that a man would climb the
Matterhorn the very first year he was married?”

“I don’t know, my dear,” I answered, evasively; “this isn’t the
first year I have been married, not by a good many, and I wouldn’t
climb it—for a farm.”

“You know what I mean,” she said.

I did.

       *       *       *       *       *

When we reached the boarding-house, Mr. Jacobus took me aside.

“You know,” he began his discourse, “my wife she uset to live in N’
York!”

I didn’t know, but I said “Yes.”

“She says the numbers on the streets runs criss-cross-like.
Thirty-four’s on one side o’ the street an’ thirty-five on t’other.
How’s that?”

“That is the invariable rule, I believe.”

“Then—I say—these here new folk that you ’n’ your wife seem so
mighty taken up with—d’ye know anything about ’em?”

“I know nothing about the character of your boarders, Mr. Jacobus,”
I replied, conscious of some irritability. “If I choose to
associate with any of them——”

“Jess so—jess so!” broke in Jacobus. “I hain’t nothin’ to say
ag’inst yer sosherbil’ty. But do ye _know_ them?”

“Why, certainly not,” I replied.

“Well—that was all I wuz askin’ ye. Ye see, when _he_ come here
to take the rooms—you wasn’t here then—he told my wife that he
lived at number thirty-four in his street. An’ yistiddy _she_ told
her that they lived at number thirty-five. He said he lived in an
apartment-house. Now there can’t be no apartment-house on two sides
of the same street, kin they?”

“What street was it?” I inquired, wearily.

“Hundred ’n’ twenty-first street.”

“May be,” I replied, still more wearily. “That’s Harlem. Nobody
knows what people will do in Harlem.”

I went up to my wife’s room.

“Don’t you think it’s queer?” she asked me.

“I think I’ll have a talk with that young man to-night,” I said,
“and see if he can give some account of himself.”

“But, my dear,” my wife said, gravely, “_she_ doesn’t know whether
they’ve had the measles or not.”

“Why, Great Scott!” I exclaimed, “they must have had them when they
were children.”

“Please don’t be stupid,” said my wife. “I meant _their_ children.”

After dinner that night—or rather, after supper, for we had dinner
in the middle of the day at Jacobus’s—I walked down the long
verandah to ask Brede, who was placidly smoking at the other end,
to accompany me on a twilight stroll. Half way down I met Major
Halkit.

“That friend of yours,” he said, indicating the unconscious figure
at the further end of the house, “seems to be a queer sort of a
Dick. He told me that he was out of business, and just looking
round for a chance to invest his capital. And I’ve been telling him
what an everlasting big show he had to take stock in the Capitoline
Trust Company—starts next month—four million capital—I told you all
about it. ‘Oh, well,’ he says, ‘let’s wait and think about it.’
‘Wait!’ says I, ‘the Capitoline Trust Company won’t wait for _you_,
my boy. This is letting you in on the ground floor,’ says I, ‘and
it’s now or never.’ ‘Oh, let it wait,’ says he. I don’t know what’s
in-_to_ the man.”

“I don’t know how well he knows his own business, Major,” I said as
I started again for Brede’s end of the veranda. But I was troubled
none the less. The Major could not have influenced the sale of one
share of stock in the Capitoline Company. But that stock was a
great investment; a rare chance for a purchaser with a few thousand
dollars. Perhaps it was no more remarkable that Brede should
not invest than that I should not—and yet, it seemed to add one
circumstance more to the other suspicious circumstances.

       *       *       *       *       *

When I went upstairs that evening, I found my wife putting her hair
to bed—I don’t know how I can better describe an operation familiar
to every married man. I waited until the last tress was coiled up,
and then I spoke:

“I’ve talked with Brede,” I said, “and I didn’t have to catechize
him. He seemed to feel that some sort of explanation was looked
for, and he was very outspoken. You were right about the
children—that is, I must have misunderstood him. There are only
two. But the Matterhorn episode was simple enough. He didn’t
realize how dangerous it was until he had got so far into it that
he couldn’t back out; and he didn’t tell her, because he’d left her
here, you see, and under the circumstances——”

“Left her here!” cried my wife. “I’ve been sitting with her the
whole afternoon, sewing, and she told me that he left her at
Geneva, and came back and took her to Basle, and the baby was born
there—now I’m sure, dear, because I asked her.”

“Perhaps I was mistaken when I thought he said she was on this side
of the water,” I suggested, with bitter, biting irony.

“You poor dear, did I abuse you?” said my wife. “But, do you know,
Mrs. Tabb said that _she_ didn’t know how many lumps of sugar he
took in his coffee. Now that seems queer, doesn’t it?”

It did. It was a small thing. But it looked queer, Very queer.

       *       *       *       *       *

The next morning, it was clear that war was declared against the
Bredes. They came down to breakfast somewhat late, and, as soon
as they arrived, the Biggleses swooped up the last fragments that
remained on their plates, and made a stately march out of the
dining-room, Then Miss Hoogencamp arose and departed, leaving a
whole fish-ball on her plate. Even as Atalanta might have dropped
an apple behind her to tempt her pursuer to check his speed, so
Miss Hoogencamp left that fish-ball behind her, and between her
maiden self and contamination.

We had finished our breakfast, my wife and I, before the Bredes
appeared. We talked it over, and agreed that we were glad that we
had not been obliged to take sides upon such insufficient testimony.

After breakfast, it was the custom of the male half of the Jacobus
household to go around the corner of the building and smoke their
pipes and cigars where they would not annoy the ladies. We sat
under a trellis covered with a grapevine that had borne no grapes
in the memory of man. This vine, however, bore leaves, and these,
on that pleasant summer morning, shielded from us two persons
who were in earnest conversation in the straggling, half-dead
flower-garden at the side of the house.

“I don’t want,” we heard Mr. Jacobus say, “to enter in no man’s
_pry_-vacy; but I do want to know who it may be, like, that I hev
in my house. Now what I ask of _you_, and I don’t want you to take
it as in no ways _personal_, is—hev you your merridge-license with
you?”

“No,” we heard the voice of Mr. Brede reply. “Have you yours?”

I think it was a chance shot; but it told all the same. The Major
(he was a widower) and Mr. Biggle and I looked at each other; and
Mr. Jacobus, on the other side of the grape-trellis, looked at—I
don’t know what—and was as silent as we were.

Where is _your_ marriage-license, married reader? Do you know?
Four men, not including Mr. Brede, stood or sat on one side or
the other of that grape-trellis, and not one of them knew where
his marriage-license was. Each of us had had one—the Major had
had three. But where were they? Where is _yours_? Tucked in your
best-man’s pocket; deposited in his desk—or washed to a pulp in his
white waistcoat (if white waistcoats be the fashion of the hour),
washed out of existence—can you tell where it is? Can you—unless
you are one of those people who frame that interesting document and
hang it upon their drawing-room walls?

Mr. Brede’s voice arose, after an awful stillness of what seemed
like five minutes, and was, probably, thirty seconds:

“Mr. Jacobus, will you make out your bill at once, and let me pay
it? I shall leave by the six o’clock train. And will you also send
the wagon for my trunks?”

“I hain’t said I wanted to hev ye leave——” began Mr. Jacobus; but
Brede cut him short.

“Bring me your bill.”

“But,” remonstrated Jacobus, “ef ye ain’t——”

“Bring me your bill!” said Mr. Brede.

       *       *       *       *       *

My wife and I went out for our morning’s walk. But it seemed to
us, when we looked at “our view,” as if we could only see those
invisible villages of which Brede had told us—that other side of
the ridges and rises of which we catch no glimpse from lofty hills
or from the heights of human self-esteem. We meant to stay out
until the Bredes had taken their departure; but we returned just
in time to see Pete, the Jacobus darkey, the blacker of boots, the
brasher of coats, the general handy-man of the house, loading the
Brede trunks on the Jacobus wagon.

And, as we stepped upon the verandah, down came Mrs. Brede, leaning
on Mr. Brede’s arm, as though she were ill; and it was clear that
she had been crying. There were heavy rings about her pretty black
eyes.

My wife took a step toward her.

“Look at that dress, dear,” she whispered; “she never thought
anything like this was going to happen when she put _that_ on.”

It was a pretty, delicate, dainty dress, a graceful, narrow-striped
affair. Her hat was trimmed with a narrow-striped silk of the same
colors—maroon and white—and in her hand she held a parasol that
matched her dress.

“She’s had a new dress on twice a day,” said my wife, “but that’s
the prettiest yet. Oh, somehow—I’m _awfully_ sorry they’re going!”

But going they were. They moved toward the steps. Mrs. Brede looked
toward my wife, and my wife moved toward Mrs. Brede. But the
ostracized woman, as though she felt the deep humiliation of her
position, turned sharply away, and opened her parasol to shield
her eyes from the sun. A shower of rice—a half-pound shower of
rice—fell down over her pretty hat and her pretty dress, and fell
in a spattering circle on the floor, outlining her skirts—and there
it lay in a broad, uneven band, bright in the morning sun.

Mrs. Brede was in my wife’s arms, sobbing as if her young heart
would break.

“Oh, you poor, dear, silly children!” my wife cried, as Mrs. Brede
sobbed on her shoulder, “why _didn’t_ you tell us?”

“W-W-W-We didn’t want to be t-t-taken for a b-b-b-b-bridal couple,”
sobbed Mrs. Brede; “and we d-d-didn’t _dream_ what awful lies we’d
have to tell, and all the aw-awful mixed-up-ness of it. Oh, dear,
dear, dear!”

       *       *       *       *       *

“Pete!” commanded Mr. Jacobus, “put back them trunks. These folks
stays here’s long’s they wants ter. Mr. Brede”—he held out a large,
hard hand—“I’d orter’ve known better,” he said. And my last doubt
of Mr. Brede vanished as he shook that grimy hand in manly fashion.

The two women were walking off toward “our view,” each with an arm
about the other’s waist—touched by a sudden sisterhood of sympathy.

“Gentlemen,” said Mr. Brede, addressing Jacobus, Biggle, the Major
and me, “there is a hostelry down the street where they sell honest
New Jersey beer. I recognize the obligations of the situation.”

We five men filed down the street. The two women went toward the
pleasant slope where the sunlight gilded the forehead of the great
hill. On Mr. Jacobus’s veranda lay a spattered circle of shining
grains of rice. Two of Mr. Jacobus’s pigeons flew down and picked
up the shining grains, making grateful noises far down in their
throats.

THE BULLER-PODINGTON COMPACT[22]

BY FRANK RICHARD STOCKTON (1834–1902)


“I tell you, William,” said Thomas Buller to his friend Mr.
Podington, “I am truly sorry about it, but I cannot arrange for it
this year. Now, as to _my_ invitation—that is very different.”

“Of course it is different,” was the reply, “but I am obliged to
say, as I said before, that I really cannot accept it.”

Remarks similar to these had been made by Thomas Buller and William
Podington at least once a year for some five years. They were old
friends; they had been schoolboys together and had been associated
in business since they were young men. They had now reached a
vigorous middle age; they were each married, and each had a house
in the country in which he resided for a part of the year. They
were warmly attached to each other, and each was the best friend
which the other had in this world. But during all these years
neither of them had visited the other in his country home.

The reason for this avoidance of each other at their respective
rural residences may be briefly stated. Mr. Buller’s country house
was situated by the sea, and he was very fond of the water. He had
a good cat-boat, which he sailed himself with much judgment and
skill, and it was his greatest pleasure to take his friends and
visitors upon little excursions on the bay. But Mr. Podington was
desperately afraid of the water, and he was particularly afraid of
any craft sailed by an amateur. If his friend Buller would have
employed a professional mariner, of years and experience, to steer
and manage his boat, Podington might have been willing to take an
occasional sail; but as Buller always insisted upon sailing his own
boat, and took it ill if any of his visitors doubted his ability
to do so properly, Podington did not wish to wound the self-love
of his friend, and he did not wish to be drowned. Consequently he
could not bring himself to consent to go to Buller’s house by the
sea.

To receive his good friend Buller at his own house in the beautiful
upland region in which he lived would have been a great joy to Mr.
Podington; but Buller could not be induced to visit him. Podington
was very fond of horses and always drove himself, while Buller
was more afraid of horses than he was of elephants or lions. To
one or more horses driven by a coachman of years and experience
he did not always object, but to a horse driven by Podington, who
had much experience and knowledge regarding mercantile affairs,
but was merely an amateur horseman, he most decidedly and strongly
objected. He did not wish to hurt his friend’s feelings by refusing
to go out to drive with him, but he would not rack his own nervous
system by accompanying him. Therefore it was that he had not yet
visited the beautiful upland country residence of Mr. Podington.

At last this state of things grew awkward. Mrs. Buller and Mrs.
Podington, often with their families, visited each other at their
country houses, but the fact that on these occasions they were
never accompanied by their husbands caused more and more gossip
among their neighbors both in the upland country and by the sea.

One day in spring as the two sat in their city office, where Mr.
Podington had just repeated his annual invitation, his friend
replied to him thus:

“William, if I come to see you this summer, will you visit me? The
thing is beginning to look a little ridiculous, and people are
talking about it.”

Mr. Podington put his hand to his brow and for a few moments closed
his eyes. In his mind he saw a cat-boat upon its side, the sails
spread out over the water, and two men, almost entirely immersed
in the waves, making efforts to reach the side of the boat. One of
these was getting on very well—that was Buller. The other seemed
about to sink, his arms were uselessly waving in the air—that was
himself. But he opened his eyes and looked bravely out of the
window; it was time to conquer all this; it was indeed growing
ridiculous. Buller had been sailing many years and had never been
upset.

“Yes,” said he; “I will do it; I am ready any time you name.”

Mr. Buller rose and stretched out his hand.

“Good!” said he; “it is a compact!”

Buller was the first to make the promised country visit. He had not
mentioned the subject of horses to his friend, but he knew through
Mrs. Buller that Podington still continued to be his own driver.
She had informed him, however, that at present he was accustomed to
drive a big black horse which, in her opinion, was as gentle and
reliable as these animals ever became, and she could not imagine
how anybody could be afraid of him. So when, the next morning after
his arrival, Mr. Buller was asked by his host if he would like to
take a drive, he suppressed a certain rising emotion and said that
it would please him very much.

When the good black horse had jogged along a pleasant road for
half an hour Mr. Buller began to feel that, perhaps, for all
these years he had been laboring under a misconception. It seemed
to be possible that there were some horses to which surrounding
circumstances in the shape of sights and sounds were so irrelevant
that they were to a certain degree entirely safe, even when guided
and controlled by an amateur hand. As they passed some meadow-land,
somebody behind a hedge fired a gun; Mr. Buller was frightened, but
the horse was not.

“William,” said Buller, looking cheerfully around him,

“I had no idea that you lived in such a pretty country. In fact, I
might almost call it beautiful. You have not any wide stretch of
water, such as I like so much, but here is a pretty river, those
rolling hills are very charming, and, beyond, you have the blue of
the mountains.”

“It is lovely,” said his friend; “I never get tired of driving
through this country. Of course the seaside is very fine, but here
we have such a variety of scenery.”

Mr. Buller could not help thinking that sometimes the seaside was
a little monotonous, and that he had lost a great deal of pleasure
by not varying his summers by going up to spend a week or two with
Podington.

“William,” said he, “how long have you had this horse?”

“About two years,” said Mr. Podington; “before I got him, I used to
drive a pair.”

“Heavens!” thought Buller, “how lucky I was not to come two years
ago!” And his regrets for not sooner visiting his friend greatly
decreased.

Now they came to a place where the stream, by which the road ran,
had been dammed for a mill and had widened into a beautiful pond.

“There now!” cried Mr. Buller. “That’s what I like. William, you
seem to have everything! This is really a very pretty sheet of
water, and the reflections of the trees over there make a charming
picture; you can’t get that at the seaside, you know.”

Mr. Podington was delighted; his face glowed; he was rejoiced at
the pleasure of his friend. “I tell you, Thomas,” said he, “that——”

“William!” exclaimed Buller, with a sudden squirm in his seat,
“what is that I hear? Is that a train?”

“Yes,” said Mr. Podington, “that is the ten-forty, up.”

“Does it come near here?” asked Mr. Buller, nervously. “Does it go
over that bridge?”

“Yes,” said Podington, “but it can’t hurt us, for our road goes
under the bridge; we are perfectly safe; there is no risk of
accident.”

“But your horse! Your horse!” exclaimed Buller, as the train came
nearer and nearer. “What will he do?”

“Do?” said Podington; “he’ll do what he is doing now; he doesn’t
mind trains.”

“But look here, William,” exclaimed Buller, “it will get there just
as we do; no horse could stand a roaring up in the air like that!”

Podington laughed. “He would not mind it in the least,” said he.

“Come, come now,” cried Buller. “Really, I can’t stand this! Just
stop a minute, William, and let me get out. It sets all my nerves
quivering.”

Mr. Podington smiled with a superior smile. “Oh, you needn’t get
out,” said he; “there’s not the least danger in the world. But I
don’t want to make you nervous, and I will turn around and drive
the other way.”

“But you can’t!” screamed Buller. “This road is not wide enough,
and that train is nearly here. Please stop!”

The imputation that the road was not wide enough for him to turn
was too much for Mr. Podington to bear. He was very proud of his
ability to turn a vehicle in a narrow place.

“Turn!” said he; “that’s the easiest thing in the world. See; a
little to the right, then a back, then a sweep to the left and we
will be going the other way.” And instantly he began the maneuver
in which he was such an adept.

“Oh, Thomas!” cried Buller, half rising in his seat, “that train is
almost here!”

“And we are almost——” Mr. Podington was about to say “turned
around,” but he stopped. Mr. Buller’s exclamations had made him a
little nervous, and, in his anxiety to turn quickly, he had pulled
upon his horse’s bit with more energy than was actually necessary,
and his nervousness being communicated to the horse, that animal
backed with such extraordinary vigor that the hind wheels of the
wagon went over a bit of grass by the road and into the water. The
sudden jolt gave a new impetus to Mr. Buller’s fears.

“You’ll upset!” he cried, and not thinking of what he was about, he
laid hold of his friend’s arm. The horse, startled by this sudden
jerk upon his bit, which, combined with the thundering of the
train, which was now on the bridge, made him think that something
extraordinary was about to happen, gave a sudden and forcible start
backward, so that not only the hind wheels of the light wagon,
but the fore wheels and his own hind legs went into the water.
As the bank at this spot sloped steeply, the wagon continued to
go backward, despite the efforts of the agitated horse to find a
footing on the crumbling edge of the bank.

“Whoa!” cried Mr. Buller.

“Get up!” exclaimed Mr. Podington, applying his whip upon the
plunging beast.

But exclamations and castigations had no effect upon the horse. The
original bed of the stream ran close to the road, and the bank was
so steep and the earth so soft that it was impossible for the horse
to advance or even maintain his footing. Back, back he went, until
the whole equipage was in the water and the wagon was afloat.

This vehicle was a road wagon, without a top, and the joints of its
box-body were tight enough to prevent the water from immediately
entering it; so, somewhat deeply sunken, it rested upon the water.
There was a current in this part of the pond and it turned the
wagon downstream. The horse was now entirely immersed in the water,
with the exception of his head and the upper part of his neck, and,
unable to reach the bottom with his feet, he made vigorous efforts
to swim.

Mr. Podington, the reins and whip in his hands, sat horrified
and pale; the accident was so sudden, he was so startled and so
frightened that, for a moment, he could not speak a word. Mr.
Buller, on the other hand, was now lively and alert. The wagon
had no sooner floated away from the shore than he felt himself at
home. He was upon his favorite element; water had no fears for
him. He saw that his friend was nearly frightened out of his wits,
and that, figuratively speaking, he must step to the helm and take
charge of the vessel. He stood up and gazed about him.

“Put her across stream!” he shouted; “she can’t make headway
against this current. Head her to that clump of trees on the other
side; the bank is lower there, and we can beach her. Move a little
the other way, we must trim boat. Now then, pull on your starboard
rein.”

Podington obeyed, and the horse slightly changed his direction.

“You see,” said Buller, “it won’t do to sail straight across,
because the current would carry us down and land us below that
spot.”

Mr. Podington said not a word; he expected every moment to see the
horse sink into a watery grave.

“It isn’t so bad after all, is it, Podington? If we had a rudder
and a bit of a sail it would be a great help to the horse. This
wagon is not a bad boat.”

The despairing Podington looked at his feet. “It’s coming in,” he
said in a husky voice. “Thomas, the water is over my shoes!”

“That is so,” said Buller. “I am so used to water I didn’t notice
it. She leaks. Do you carry anything to bail her out with?”

“Bail!” cried Podington, now finding his voice. “Oh, Thomas, we are
sinking!”

“That’s so,” said Buller; “she leaks like a sieve.”

The weight of the running-gear and of the two men was entirely too
much for the buoyancy of the wagon body. The water rapidly rose
toward the top of its sides.

“We are going to drown!” cried Podington, suddenly rising.

“Lick him! Lick him!” exclaimed Buller. “Make him swim faster!”

“There’s nothing to lick,” cried Podington, vainly lashing at the
water, for he could not reach the horse’s head. The poor man was
dreadfully frightened; he had never even imagined it possible that
he should be drowned in his own wagon.

“Whoop!” cried Buller, as the water rose over the sides. “Steady
yourself, old boy, or you’ll go overboard!” And the next moment the
wagon body sunk out of sight.

But it did not go down very far. The deepest part of the channel of
the stream had been passed, and with a bump the wheels struck the
bottom.

“Heavens!” exclaimed Buller, “we are aground.”

“Aground!” exclaimed Podington, “Heaven be praised!”

As the two men stood up in the submerged wagon the water was above
their knees, and when Podington looked out over the surface of the
pond, now so near his face, it seemed like a sheet of water he had
never seen before. It was something horrible, threatening to rise
and envelop him. He trembled so that he could scarcely keep his
footing.

“William,” said his companion, “you must sit down; if you don’t,
you’ll tumble overboard and be drowned. There is nothing for you to
hold to.”

“Sit down,” said Podington, gazing blankly at the water around him,
“I can’t do that!”

At this moment the horse made a slight movement. Having touched
bottom after his efforts in swimming across the main bed of the
stream, with a floating wagon in tow, he had stood for a few
moments, his head and neck well above water, and his back barely
visible beneath the surface. Having recovered his breath, he now
thought it was time to move on.

At the first step of the horse Mr. Podington began to totter.
Instinctively he clutched Buller.

“Sit down!” cried the latter, “or you’ll have us both overboard.”
There was no help for it; down sat Mr. Podington; and, as with a
great splash he came heavily upon the seat, the water rose to his
waist.

“Ough!” said he. “Thomas, shout for help.”

“No use doing that,” replied Buller, still standing on his nautical
legs; “I don’t see anybody, and I don’t see any boat. We’ll get out
all right. Just you stick tight to the thwart.”

“The what?” feebly asked the other.

“Oh, the seat, I mean. We can get to the shore all right if you
steer the horse straight. Head him more across the pond.”

“I can’t head him,” cried Podington. “I have dropped the reins!”

“Good gracious!” cried Mr. Buller, “that’s bad. Can’t you steer him
by shouting ‘Gee’ and ‘Haw’?”

“No,” said Podington, “he isn’t an ox; but perhaps I can stop him.”
And with as much voice as he could summon, he called out: “Whoa!”
and the horse stopped.

“If you can’t steer him any other way,” said Buller, “we must get
the reins. Lend me your whip.”

“I have dropped that too,” said Podington; “there it floats.”

“Oh, dear,” said Buller, “I guess I’ll have to dive for them; if he
were to run away, we should be in an awful fix.”

“Don’t get out! Don’t get out!” exclaimed Podington. “You can reach
over the dashboard.”

“As that’s under water,” said Buller, “it will be the same thing as
diving; but it’s got to be done, and I’ll try it. Don’t you move
now; I am more used to water than you are.”

Mr. Buller took off his hat and asked his friend to hold it. He
thought of his watch and other contents of his pockets, but there
was no place to put them, so he gave them no more consideration.
Then bravely getting on his knees in the water, he leaned over the
dashboard, almost disappearing from sight. With his disengaged hand
Mr. Podington grasped the submerged coat-tails of his friend.

In a few seconds the upper part of Mr. Buller rose from the water.
He was dripping and puffing, and Mr. Podington could not but think
what a difference it made in the appearance of his friend to have
his hair plastered close to his head.

“I got hold of one of them,” said the sputtering Buller, “but it
was fast to something and I couldn’t get it loose.”

“Was it thick and wide?” asked Podington.

“Yes,” was the answer; “it did seem so.”

“Oh, that was a trace,” said Podington; “I don’t want that; the
reins are thinner and lighter.”

“Now I remember they are,” said Buller. “I’ll go down again.”

Again Mr. Buller leaned over the dashboard, and this time he
remained down longer, and when he came up he puffed and sputtered
more than before.

“Is this it?” said he, holding up a strip of wet leather.

“Yes,” said Podington, “you’ve got the reins.”

“Well, take them, and steer. I would have found them sooner if his
tail had not got into my eyes. That long tail’s floating down there
and spreading itself out like a fan; it tangled itself all around
my head. It would have been much easier if he had been a bob-tailed
horse.”

“Now then,” said Podington, “take your hat, Thomas, and I’ll try to
drive.”

Mr. Buller put on his hat, which was the only dry thing about him,
and the nervous Podington started the horse so suddenly that even
the sea-legs of Buller were surprised, and he came very near going
backward into the water; but recovering himself, he sat down.

“I don’t wonder you did not like to do this, William,” said he.
“Wet as I am, it’s ghastly!”

Encouraged by his master’s voice, and by the feeling of the
familiar hand upon his bit, the horse moved bravely on.

But the bottom was very rough and uneven. Sometimes the wheels
struck a large stone, terrifying Mr. Buller, who thought they were
going to upset; and sometimes they sank into soft mud, horrifying
Mr. Podington, who thought they were going to drown.

Thus proceeding, they presented a strange sight. At first Mr.
Podington held his hands above the water as he drove, but he soon
found this awkward, and dropped them to their usual position, so
that nothing was visible above the water but the head and neck of a
horse and the heads and shoulders of two men.

Now the submarine equipage came to a low place in the bottom, and
even Mr. Buller shuddered as the water rose to his chin. Podington
gave a howl of horror, and the horse, with high, uplifted head, was
obliged to swim. At this moment a boy with a gun came strolling
along the road, and hearing Mr. Podington’s cry, he cast his eyes
over the water. Instinctively he raised his weapon to his shoulder,
and then, in an instant, perceiving that the objects he beheld were
not aquatic birds, he dropped his gun and ran yelling down the road
toward the mill.

But the hollow in the bottom was a narrow one, and when it was
passed the depth of the water gradually decreased. The back of the
horse came into view, the dashboard became visible, and the bodies
and the spirits of the two men rapidly rose. Now there was vigorous
splashing and tugging, and then a jet black horse, shining as if he
had been newly varnished, pulled a dripping wagon containing two
well-soaked men upon a shelving shore.

“Oh, I am chilled to the bones!” said Podington.

“I should think so,” replied his friend; “if you have got to be
wet, it is a great deal pleasanter under the water.”

There was a field-road on this side of the pond which Podington
well knew, and proceeding along this they came to the bridge and
got into the main road.

“Now we must get home as fast as we can,” cried Podington, “or we
shall both take cold. I wish I hadn’t lost my whip. Hi now! Get
along!”

Podington was now full of life and energy, his wheels were on the
hard road, and he was himself again.

When he found his head was turned toward his home, the horse set
off at a great rate.

“Hi there!” cried Podington. “I am so sorry I lost my whip.”

“Whip!” said Buller, holding fast to the side of the seat; “surely
you don’t want him to go any faster than this. And look here,
William,” he added, “it seems to me we are much more likely to take
cold in our wet clothes if we rush through the air in this way.
Really, it seems to me that horse is running away.”

“Not a bit of it,” cried Podington. “He wants to get home, and he
wants his dinner. Isn’t he a fine horse? Look how he steps out!”

“Steps out!” said Buller, “I think I’d like to step out myself.
Don’t you think it would be wiser for me to walk home, William?
That will warm me up.”

“It will take you an hour,” said his friend. “Stay where you are,
and I’ll have you in a dry suit of clothes in less than fifteen
minutes.”

“I tell you, William,” said Mr. Buller, as the two sat smoking
after dinner, “what you ought to do; you should never go out
driving without a life-preserver and a pair of oars; I always take
them. It would make you feel safer.”

Mr. Buller went home the next day, because Mr. Podington’s clothes
did not fit him, and his own outdoor suit was so shrunken as to
be uncomfortable. Besides, there was another reason, connected
with the desire of horses to reach their homes, which prompted his
return. But he had not forgotten his compact with his friend, and
in the course of a week he wrote to Podington, inviting him to
spend some days with him. Mr. Podington was a man of honor, and
in spite of his recent unfortunate water experience he would not
break his word. He went to Mr. Buller’s seaside home at the time
appointed.

Early on the morning after his arrival, before the family were up,
Mr. Podington went out and strolled down to the edge of the bay.
He went to look at Buller’s boat. He was well aware that he would
be asked to take a sail, and as Buller had driven with him, it
would be impossible for him to decline sailing with Buller; but
he must see the boat. There was a train for his home at a quarter
past seven; if he were not on the premises he could not be asked to
sail. If Buller’s boat were a little, flimsy thing, he would take
that train—but he would wait and see.

There was only one small boat anchored near the beach, and a
man—apparently a fisherman—informed Mr. Podington that it belonged
to Mr. Buller. Podington looked at it eagerly; it was not very
small and not flimsy.

“Do you consider that a safe boat?” he asked the fisherman.

“Safe?” replied the man. “You could not upset her if you tried.
Look at her breadth of beam! You could go anywhere in that boat!
Are you thinking of buying her?”

The idea that he would think of buying a boat made Mr. Podington
laugh. The information that it would be impossible to upset the
little vessel had greatly cheered him, and he could laugh.

Shortly after breakfast Mr. Buller, like a nurse with a dose of
medicine, came to Mr. Podington with the expected invitation to
take a sail.

“Now, William,” said his host, “I understand perfectly your feeling
about boats, and what I wish to prove to you is that it is a
feeling without any foundation. I don’t want to shock you or make
you nervous, so I am not going to take you out to-day on the bay
in my boat. You are as safe on the bay as you would be on land—a
little safer, perhaps, under certain circumstances, to which we
will not allude—but still it is sometimes a little rough, and this,
at first, might cause you some uneasiness, and so I am going to let
you begin your education in the sailing line on perfectly smooth
water. About three miles back of us there is a very pretty lake
several miles long. It is part of the canal system which connects
the town with the railroad. I have sent my boat to the town, and we
can walk up there and go by the canal to the lake; it is only about
three miles.”

If he had to sail at all, this kind of sailing suited Mr.
Podington. A canal, a quiet lake, and a boat which could not be
upset. When they reached the town the boat was in the canal, ready
for them.

“Now,” said Mr. Buller, “you get in and make yourself comfortable.
My idea is to hitch on to a canal-boat and be towed to the lake.
The boats generally start about this time in the morning, and I
will go and see about it.”

Mr. Podington, under the direction of his friend, took a seat in
the stern of the sailboat, and then he remarked:

“Thomas, have you a life-preserver on board? You know I am not used
to any kind of vessel, and I am clumsy. Nothing might happen to the
boat, but I might trip and fall overboard, and I can’t swim.”

“All right,” said Buller; “here’s a life-preserver, and you can put
it on. I want you to feel perfectly safe. Now I will go and see
about the tow.”

But Mr. Buller found that the canal-boats would not start at their
usual time; the loading of one of them was not finished, and he was
informed that he might have to wait for an hour or more. This did
not suit Mr. Buller at all, and he did not hesitate to show his
annoyance.

“I tell you, sir, what you can do,” said one of the men in charge
of the boats; “if you don’t want to wait till we are ready to
start, we’ll let you have a boy and a horse to tow you up to the
lake. That won’t cost you much, and they’ll be back before we want
’em.”

The bargain was made, and Mr. Buller joyfully returned to his
boat with the intelligence that they were not to wait for the
canal-boats. A long rope, with a horse attached to the other end of
it, was speedily made fast to the boat, and with a boy at the head
of the horse, they started up the canal.

“Now this is the kind of sailing I like,” said Mr. Podington. “If
I lived near a canal I believe I would buy a boat and train my
horse to tow. I could have a long pair of rope-lines and drive him
myself; then when the roads were rough and bad the canal would
always be smooth.”

“This is all very nice,” replied Mr. Buller, who sat by the tiller
to keep the boat away from the bank, “and I am glad to see you in a
boat under any circumstances. Do you know, William, that although
I did not plan it, there could not have been a better way to begin
your sailing education. Here we glide along, slowly and gently,
with no possible thought of danger, for if the boat should suddenly
spring a leak, as if it were the body of a wagon, all we would have
to do would be to step on shore, and by the time you get to the
end of the canal you will like this gentle motion so much that you
will be perfectly ready to begin the second stage of your nautical
education.”

“Yes,” said Mr. Podington. “How long did you say this canal is?”

“About three miles,” answered his friend. “Then we will go into the
lock and in a few minutes we shall be on the lake.”

“So far as I am concerned,” said Mr. Podington, “I wish the canal
were twelve miles long. I cannot imagine anything pleasanter than
this. If I lived anywhere near a canal—a long canal, I mean, this
one is too short—I’d—”

“Come, come now,” interrupted Buller. “Don’t be content to stay
in the primary school just because it is easy. When we get on the
lake I will show you that in a boat, with a gentle breeze, such
as we are likely to have to-day, you will find the motion quite as
pleasing, and ever so much more inspiriting. I should not be a bit
surprised, William, if after you have been two or three times on
the lake you will ask me—yes, positively ask me—to take you out on
the bay!”

Mr. Podington smiled, and leaning backward, he looked up at the
beautiful blue sky.

“You can’t give me anything better than this, Thomas,” said he;
“but you needn’t think I am weakening; you drove with me, and I
will sail with you.”

The thought came into Buller’s mind that he had done both of these
things with Podington, but he did not wish to call up unpleasant
memories, and said nothing.

About half a mile from the town there stood a small cottage where
house-cleaning was going on, and on a fence, not far from the
canal, there hung a carpet gaily adorned with stripes and spots of
red and yellow.

When the drowsy tow-horse came abreast of the house, and the carpet
caught his eye, he suddenly stopped and gave a start toward the
canal. Then, impressed with a horror of the glaring apparition, he
gathered himself up, and with a bound dashed along the tow-path.
The astounded boy gave a shout, but was speedily left behind. The
boat of Mr. Buller shot forward as if she had been struck by a
squall.

The terrified horse sped on as if a red and yellow demon were after
him. The boat bounded, and plunged, and frequently struck the
grassy bank of the canal, as if it would break itself to pieces.
Mr. Podington clutched the boom to keep himself from being thrown
out, while Mr. Buller, both hands upon the tiller, frantically
endeavored to keep the boat from the bank.

“William!” he screamed, “he is running away with us; we shall be
dashed to pieces! Can’t you get forward and cast off that line?”

“What do you mean?” cried Podington, as the boom gave a great jerk
as if it would break its fastenings and drag him overboard.

“I mean untie the tow-line. We’ll be smashed if you don’t! I can’t
leave this tiller. Don’t try to stand up; hold on to the boom and
creep forward. Steady now, or you’ll be overboard!”

Mr. Podington stumbled to the bow of the boat, his efforts greatly
impeded by the big cork life-preserver tied under his arms, and the
motion of the boat was so violent and erratic that he was obliged
to hold on to the mast with one arm and to try to loosen the knot
with the other; but there was a great strain on the rope, and he
could do nothing with one hand.

“Cut it! Cut it!” cried Mr. Buller.

“I haven’t a knife,” replied Podington.

Mr. Buller was terribly frightened; his boat was cutting through
the water as never vessel of her class had sped since sail-boats
were invented, and bumping against the bank as if she were a
billiard-ball rebounding from the edge of a table. He forgot he was
in a boat; he only knew that for the first time in his life he was
in a runaway. He let go the tiller. It was of no use to him.

“William,” he cried, “let us jump out the next time we are near
enough to shore!”

“Don’t do that! Don’t do that!” replied Podington. “Don’t jump out
in a runaway; that is the way to get hurt. Stick to your seat, my
boy; he can’t keep this up much longer. He’ll lose his wind!”

Mr. Podington was greatly excited, but he was not frightened, as
Buller was. He had been in a runaway before, and he could not help
thinking how much better a wagon was than a boat in such a case.

“If he were hitched up shorter and I had a snaffle-bit and a stout
pair of reins,” thought he, “I could soon bring him up.”

But Mr. Buller was rapidly losing his wits. The horse seemed to be
going faster than ever. The boat bumped harder against the bank,
and at one time Buller thought they could turn over.

Suddenly a thought struck him.

“William,” he shouted, “tip that anchor over the side! Throw it in,
any way!”

Mr. Podington looked about him, and, almost under his feet, saw
the anchor. He did not instantly comprehend why Buller wanted it
thrown overboard, but this was not a time to ask questions. The
difficulties imposed by the life-preserver, and the necessity of
holding on with one hand, interfered very much with his getting at
the anchor and throwing it over the side, but at last he succeeded,
and just as the boat threw up her bow as if she were about to jump
on shore, the anchor went out and its line shot after it. There was
an irregular trembling of the boat as the anchor struggled along
the bottom of the canal; then there was a great shock; the boat
ran into the bank and stopped; the tow-line was tightened like a
guitar-string, and the horse, jerked back with great violence, came
tumbling in a heap upon the ground.

Instantly Mr. Podington was on the shore and running at the top of
his speed toward the horse. The astounded animal had scarcely begun
to struggle to his feet when Podington rushed upon him, pressed his
head back to the ground, and sat upon it.

“Hurrah!” he cried, waving his hat above his head. “Get out,
Buller; he is all right now!”

Presently Mr. Buller approached, very much shaken up.

“All right?” he said. “I don’t call a horse flat in a road with a
man on his head all right; but hold him down till we get him loose
from my boat. That is the thing to do. William, cast him loose from
the boat before you let him up! What will he do when he gets up?”

“Oh. he’ll be quiet enough when he gets up,” said Podington. “But
if you’ve got a knife you can cut his traces—-I mean that rope—but
no, you needn’t. Here comes the boy. We’ll settle this business in
very short order now.”

When the horse was on his feet, and all connection between the
animal and the boat had been severed, Mr. Podington looked at his
friend.

“Thomas,” said he, “you seem to have had a hard time of it.
You have lost your hat and you look as if you had been in a
wrestling-match.”

“I have,” replied the other; “I wrestled with that tiller and I
wonder it didn’t throw me out.”

Now approached the boy. “Shall I hitch him on again, sir?” said he.
“He’s quiet enough now.”

“No,” cried Mr. Buller; “I want no more sailing after a horse,
and, besides, we can’t go on the lake with that boat; she has been
battered about so much that she must have opened a dozen seams. The
best thing we can do is to walk home.”

Mr. Podington agreed with his friend that walking home was the
best thing they could do. The boat was examined and found to be
leaking, but not very badly, and when her mast had been unshipped
and everything had been made tight and right on board, she was
pulled out of the way of tow-lines and boats, and made fast until
she could be sent for from the town.

Mr. Buller and Mr. Podington walked back toward the town. They had
not gone very far when they met a party of boys, who, upon seeing
them, burst into unseemly laughter.

“Mister,” cried one of them, “you needn’t be afraid of tumbling
into the canal. Why don’t you take off your life-preserver and let
that other man put it on his head?”

The two friends looked at each other and could not help joining in
the laughter of the boys.

“By George! I forgot all about this,” said Podington, as he
unfastened the cork jacket. “It does look a little super-timid to
wear a life-preserver just because one happens to be walking by the
side of a canal.”

Mr. Buller tied a handkerchief on his head, and Mr. Podington
rolled up his life-preserver and carried it under his arm. Thus
they reached the town, where Buller bought a hat, Podington
dispensed with his bundle, and arrangements were made to bring back
the boat.

“Runaway in a sailboat!” exclaimed one of the canal boatmen when he
had heard about the accident. “Upon my word! That beats anything
that could happen to a man!”

“No, it doesn’t,” replied Mr. Buller, quietly. “I have gone to the
bottom in a foundered road-wagon.”

The man looked at him fixedly.

“Was you ever struck in the mud in a balloon?” he asked.

“Not yet,” replied Mr. Buller.

It required ten days to put Mr. Buller’s sailboat into proper
condition, and for ten days Mr. Podington stayed with his friend,
and enjoyed his visit very much. They strolled on the beach, they
took long walks in the back country, they fished from the end of a
pier, they smoked, they talked, and were happy and content.

“Thomas,” said Mr. Podington, on the last evening of his stay, “I
have enjoyed myself very much since I have been down here, and
now, Thomas, if I were to come down again next summer, would you
mind—would you mind, not——”

“I would not mind it a bit,” replied Buller, promptly. “I’ll never
so much as mention it; so you can come along without a thought
of it. And since you have alluded to the subject, William,” he
continued, “I’d like very much to come and see you again; you
know my visit was a very short one this year. That is a beautiful
country you live in. Such a variety of scenery, such an opportunity
for walks and rambles! But, William, if you could only make up your
mind not to——”

“Oh, that is all right!” exclaimed Podington. “I do not need to
make up my mind. You come to my house and you will never so much as
hear of it. Here’s my hand upon it!”

“And here’s mine!” said Mr. Buller.

And they shook hands over a new compact.

COLONEL STARBOTTLE FOR THE PLAINTIFF[23]

By Bret Harte (1839–1902)


It had been a day of triumph for Colonel Starbottle. First, for
his personality, as it would have been difficult to separate
the Colonel’s achievements from his individuality; second, for
his oratorical abilities as a sympathetic pleader; and third,
for his functions as the leading counsel for the Eureka Ditch
Company _versus_ the State of California. On his strictly legal
performances in this issue I prefer not to speak; there were those
who denied them, although the jury had accepted them in the face
of the ruling of the half-amused, half-cynical Judge himself. For
an hour they had laughed with the Colonel, wept with him, been
stirred to personal indignation or patriotic exaltation by his
passionate and lofty periods—what else could they do than give him
their verdict? If it was alleged by some that the American eagle,
Thomas Jefferson, and the Resolutions of ’98 had nothing whatever
to do with the contest of a ditch company over a doubtfully worded
legislative document; that wholesale abuse of the State Attorney
and his political motives had not the slightest connection with
the legal question raised—it was, nevertheless, generally accepted
that the losing party would have been only too glad to have the
Colonel on their side. And Colonel Starbottle knew this, as,
perspiring, florid, and panting, he rebuttoned the lower buttons
of his blue frock-coat, which had become loosed in an oratorical
spasm, and readjusted his old-fashioned, spotless shirt frill above
it as he strutted from the courtroom amidst the hand-shakings and
acclamations of his friends.

And here an unprecedented thing occurred. The Colonel absolutely
declined spirituous refreshment at the neighboring Palmetto Saloon,
and declared his intention of proceeding directly to his office in
the adjoining square. Nevertheless the Colonel quitted the building
alone, and apparently unarmed except for his faithful gold-headed
stick, which hung as usual from his forearm. The crowd gazed after
him with undisguised admiration of this new evidence of his pluck.
It was remembered also that a mysterious note had been handed to
him at the conclusion of his speech—evidently a challenge from the
State Attorney. It was quite plain that the Colonel—a practised
duellist—was hastening home to answer it.

But herein they were wrong. The note was in a female hand, and
simply requested the Colonel to accord an interview with the writer
at the Colonel’s office as soon as he left the court. But it was an
engagement that the Colonel—as devoted to the fair sex as he was
to the “code”—was no less prompt in accepting. He flicked away the
dust from his spotless white trousers and varnished boots with his
handkerchief, and settled his black cravat under his Byron collar
as he neared his office. He was surprised, however, on opening the
door of his private office to find his visitor already there; he
was still more startled to find her somewhat past middle age and
plainly attired. But the Colonel was brought up in a school of
Southern politeness, already antique in the republic, and his bow
of courtesy belonged to the epoch of his shirt frill and strapped
trousers. No one could have detected his disappointment in his
manner, albeit his sentences were short and incomplete. But the
Colonel’s colloquial speech was apt to be fragmentary incoherencies
of his larger oratorical utterances.

“A thousand pardons—for—er—having kept a lady waiting—er!
But—er—congratulations of friends—and—er—courtesy due to
them—er—interfered with—though perhaps only heightened—by
procrastination—pleasure of—ha!” And the Colonel completed his
sentence with a gallant wave of his fat but white and well-kept
hand.

“Yes! I came to see you along o’ that speech of yours. I was in
court. When I heard you gettin’ it off on that jury, I says to
myself that’s the kind o’ lawyer _I_ want. A man that’s flowery and
convincin’! Just the man to take up our case.”

“Ah! It’s a matter of business, I see,” said the Colonel, inwardly
relieved, but externally careless. “And—er—may I ask the nature of
the case?”

“Well! it’s a breach-o’-promise suit,” said the visitor, calmly.

If the Colonel had been surprised before, he was now really
startled, and with an added horror that required all his politeness
to conceal. Breach-of-promise cases were his peculiar aversion. He
had always held them to be a kind of litigation which could have
been obviated by the prompt killing of the masculine offender—in
which case he would have gladly defended the killer. But a suit
for damages!—_damages!_—with the reading of love-letters before
a hilarious jury and court, was against all his instincts. His
chivalry was outraged; his sense of humor was small—and in the
course of his career he had lost one or two important cases through
an unexpected development of this quality in a jury.

The woman had evidently noticed his hesitation, but mistook its
cause. “It ain’t me—but my darter.”

The Colonel recovered his politeness. “Ah! I am relieved, my dear
madam! I could hardly conceive a man ignorant enough to—er—er—throw
away such evident good fortune—or base enough to deceive the
trustfulness of womanhood—matured and experienced only in the
chivalry of our sex, ha!”

The woman smiled grimly. “Yes!—it’s my darter, Zaidee Hooker—so ye
might spare some of them pretty speeches for _her_—before the jury.”

The Colonel winced slightly before this doubtful prospect, but
smiled. “Ha! Yes!—certainly—the jury. But—er—my dear lady, need
we go as far as that? Cannot this affair be settled—er—out of
court? Could not this—er—individual—be admonished—told that he
must give satisfaction—personal satisfaction—for his dastardly
conduct—to —er—near relative—or even valued personal friend?
The—er—arrangements necessary for that purpose I myself would
undertake.”

He was quite sincere; indeed, his small black eyes shone with that
fire which a pretty woman or an “affair of honor” could alone
kindle. The visitor stared vacantly at him, and said, slowly:

“And what good is that goin’ to do _us_?”

“Compel him to—er—perform his promise,” said the Colonel, leaning
back in his chair.

“Ketch him doin’ it!” said the woman, scornfully. “No—that ain’t
wot we’re after. We must make him _pay_! Damages—and nothin’ short
o’ _that_.”

The Colonel bit his lip. “I suppose,” he said, gloomily, “you have
documentary evidence—written promises and protestations—er—er—
love-letters, in fact?”

“No—nary a letter! Ye see, that’s jest it—and that’s where _you_
come in. You’ve got to convince that jury yourself. You’ve got to
show what it is—tell the whole story your own way. Lord! to a man
like you that’s nothin’.”

Startling as this admission might have been to any other lawyer,
Starbottle was absolutely relieved by it. The absence of any
mirth-provoking correspondence, and the appeal solely to his own
powers of persuasion, actually struck his fancy. He lightly put
aside the compliment with a wave of his white hand.

“Of course,” said the Colonel, confidently, “there is strongly
presumptive and corroborative evidence? Perhaps you can give
me—er—a brief outline of the affair?”

“Zaidee kin do that straight enough, I reckon,” said the woman;
“what I want to know first is, kin you take the case?”

The Colonel did not hesitate; his curiosity was piqued. “I
certainly can. I have no doubt your daughter will put me in
possession of sufficient facts and details—to constitute what we
call—er—a brief.”

“She kin be brief enough—or long enough—for the matter of that,”
said the woman, rising. The Colonel accepted this implied witticism
with a smile.

“And when may I have the pleasure of seeing her?” he asked,
politely.

“Well, I reckon as soon as I can trot out and call her. She’s just
outside, meanderin’ in the road—kinder shy, ye know, at first.”

She walked to the door. The astounded Colonel nevertheless
gallantly accompanied her as she stepped out into the street and
called, shrilly, “You Zaidee!”

A young girl here apparently detached herself from a tree and the
ostentatious perusal of an old election poster, and sauntered down
towards the office door. Like her mother, she was plainly dressed;
unlike her, she had a pale, rather refined face, with a demure
mouth and downcast eyes. This was all the Colonel saw as he bowed
profoundly and led the way into his office, for she accepted his
salutations without lifting her head. He helped her gallantly
to a chair, on which she seated herself sideways, somewhat
ceremoniously, with her eyes following the point of her parasol as
she traced a pattern on the carpet. A second chair offered to the
mother that lady, however, declined. “I reckon to leave you and
Zaidee together to talk it out,” she said; turning to her daughter,
she added, “Jest you tell him all, Zaidee,” and before the Colonel
could rise again, disappeared from the room. In spite of his
professional experience, Starbottle was for a moment embarrassed.
The young girl, however, broke the silence without looking up.

“Adoniram K. Hotchkiss,” she began, in a monotonous voice, as if
it were a recitation addressed to the public, “first began to take
notice of me a year ago. Arter that—off and on——”

“One moment,” interrupted the astounded Colonel; “do you mean
Hotchkiss the President of the Ditch Company?” He had recognized
the name of a prominent citizen—a rigid ascetic, taciturn,
middle-aged man—a deacon—and more than that, the head of the
company he had just defended. It seemed inconceivable.

“That’s him,” she continued, with eyes still fixed on the parasol
and without changing her monotonous tone—“off and on ever since.
Most of the time at the Free-Will Baptist church—at morning
service, prayer-meetings, and such. And at home—outside—er—in the
road.”

“Is it this gentleman—Mr. Adoniram K. Hotchkiss—who—er—promised
marriage?” stammered the Colonel.

“Yes.”

The Colonel shifted uneasily in his chair. “Most extraordinary!
for—you see—my dear young lady—this becomes—a—er—most delicate
affair.”

“That’s what maw said,” returned the young woman, simply, yet with
the faintest smile playing around her demure lips and downcast
cheek.

“I mean,” said the Colonel, with a pained yet courteous smile,
“that this—er—gentleman—is in fact—er—one of my clients.”

“That’s what maw said, too, and of course your knowing him will
make it all the easier for you,” said the young woman.

A slight flush crossed the Colonel’s cheek as he returned quickly
and a little stiffly, “On the contrary—er—it may make it impossible
for me to—er—act in this matter.”

The girl lifted her eyes. The Colonel held his breath as the long
lashes were raised to his level. Even to an ordinary observer that
sudden revelation of her eyes seemed to transform her face with
subtle witchery. They were large, brown, and soft, yet filled with
an extraordinary penetration and prescience. They were the eyes of
an experienced woman of thirty fixed in the face of a child. What
else the Colonel saw there Heaven only knows! He felt his inmost
secrets plucked from him—his whole soul laid bare—his vanity,
belligerency, gallantry—even his medieval chivalry, penetrated, and
yet illuminated, in that single glance. And when the eyelids fell
again, he felt that a greater part of himself had been swallowed up
in them.

“I beg your pardon,” he said, hurriedly. “I mean—this matter
may be arranged—er—amicably. My interest with—and as you wisely
say—my—er—knowledge of my client—er—Mr. Hotchkiss—may affect—a
compromise.”

“And _damages_,” said the young girl, readdressing her parasol, as
if she had never looked up.

The Colonel winced. “And—er—undoubtedly _compensation_—if you do
not press a fulfilment of the promise. Unless,” he said, with an
attempted return to his former easy gallantry, which, however,
the recollection of her eyes made difficult, “it is a question
of—er—the affections?”

“Which?” said his fair client, softly.

“If you still love him?” explained the Colonel, actually blushing.

Zaidee again looked up; again taking the Colonel’s breath away
with eyes that expressed not only the fullest perception of what
he had _said_, but of what he thought and had not said, and with
an added subtle suggestion of what he might have thought. “That’s
tellin’,” she said, dropping her long lashes again. The Colonel
laughed vacantly. Then feeling himself growing imbecile, he forced
an equally weak gravity. “Pardon me—I understand there are no
letters; may I know the way in which he formulated his declaration
and promises?”

“Hymn-books,” said the girl, briefly.

“I beg your pardon,” said the mystified lawyer.

“Hymn-books—marked words in them with pencil—and passed ’em on to
me,” repeated Zaidee. “Like ‘love,’ ‘dear,’ ‘precious,’ ‘sweet,’
and ‘blessed,’” she added, accenting each word with a push of her
parasol on the carpet. “Sometimes a whole line outer Tate and
Brady—and _Solomon’s Song_, you know, and sich.”

“I believe,” said the Colonel, loftily, “that the—er—phrases of
sacred psalmody lend themselves to the language of the affections.
But in regard to the distinct promise of marriage—was there—er—no
_other_ expression?”

“Marriage Service in the prayer-book—lines and words outer
that—all marked,” said Zaidee. The Colonel nodded naturally and
approvingly. “Very good. Were others cognizant of this? Were there
any witnesses?”

“Of course not,” said the girl. “Only me and him. It was generally
at church-time—or prayer-meeting. Once, in passing the plate, he
slipped one o’ them peppermint lozenges with the letters stamped on
it ‘I love you’ for me to take.”

The Colonel coughed slightly. “And you have the lozenge?”

“I ate it,” said the girl, simply.

“Ah,” said the Colonel. After a pause he added, delicately: “But
were these attentions—er—confined to—er—-sacred precincts? Did he
meet you elsewhere?”

“Useter pass our house on the road,” returned the girl, dropping
into her monotonous recital, “and useter signal.”

“Ah, signal?” repeated the Colonel, approvingly.

“Yes! He’d say ‘Kerrow,’ and I’d say ‘Kerree.’ Suthing like a bird,
you know.”

Indeed, as she lifted her voice in imitation of the call the
Colonel thought it certainly very sweet and birdlike. At least
as _she_ gave it. With his remembrance of the grim deacon he had
doubts as to the melodiousness of _his_ utterance. He gravely made
her repeat it.

“And after that signal?” he added, suggestively.

“He’d pass on,” said the girl.

The Colonel coughed slightly, and tapped his desk with his
pen-holder.

“Were there any endearments—er—caresses—er—such as taking your
hand—er—clasping your waist?” he suggested, with a gallant yet
respectful sweep of his white hand and bowing of his head;—“er—
slight pressure of your fingers in the changes of a dance—I mean,”
he corrected himself, with an apologetic cough—“in the passing of
the plate?”

“No;—he was not what you’d call ’fond,’” returned the girl.

“Ah! Adoniram K. Hotchkiss was not ’fond’ in the ordinary
acceptance of the word,” said the Colonel, with professional
gravity.

She lifted her disturbing eyes, and again absorbed his in her
own. She also said “Yes,” although her eyes in their mysterious
prescience of all he was thinking disclaimed the necessity of any
answer at all. He smiled vacantly. There was a long pause. On which
she slowly disengaged her parasol from the carpet pattern and stood
up.

“I reckon that’s about all,” she said.

“Er—yes—but one moment,” said the Colonel, vaguely. He would have
liked to keep her longer, but with her strange premonition of him
he felt powerless to detain her, or explain his reason for doing
so. He instinctively knew she had told him all; his professional
judgment told him that a more hopeless case had never come to his
knowledge. Yet he was not daunted, only embarrassed. “No matter,”
he said, vaguely. “Of course I shall have to consult with you
again.” Her eyes again answered that she expected he would, but she
added, simply, “When?”

“In the course of a day or two,” said the Colonel, quickly. “I will
send you word.” She turned to go. In his eagerness to open the
door for her he upset his chair, and with some confusion, that was
actually youthful, he almost impeded her movements in the hall,
and knocked his broad-brimmed Panama hat from his bowing hand in a
final gallant sweep. Yet as her small, trim, youthful figure, with
its simple Leghorn straw hat confined by a blue bow under her round
chin, passed away before him, she looked more like a child than
ever.

The Colonel spent that afternoon in making diplomatic inquiries.
He found his youthful client was the daughter of a widow who had
a small ranch on the cross-roads, near the new Free-Will Baptist
church—the evident theatre of this pastoral. They led a secluded
life; the girl being little known in the town, and her beauty and
fascination apparently not yet being a recognized fact. The Colonel
felt a pleasurable relief at this, and a general satisfaction he
could not account for. His few inquiries concerning Mr. Hotchkiss
only confirmed his own impressions of the alleged lover—a
serious-minded, practically abstracted man—abstentive of youthful
society, and the last man apparently capable of levity of the
affections or serious flirtation. The Colonel was mystified—but
determined of purpose—whatever that purpose might have been.

The next day he was at his office at the same hour. He was alone—as
usual—the Colonel’s office really being his private lodgings,
disposed in connecting rooms, a single apartment reserved for
consultation. He had no clerk; his papers and briefs being taken by
his faithful body-servant and ex-slave “Jim” to another firm who
did his office-work since the death of Major Stryker—the Colonel’s
only law partner, who fell in a duel some years previous. With a
fine constancy the Colonel still retained his partner’s name on
his door-plate—and, it was alleged by the superstitious, kept a
certain invincibility also through the _manes_ of that lamented and
somewhat feared man.

The Colonel consulted his watch, whose heavy gold case still showed
the marks of a providential interference with a bullet destined
for its owner, and replaced it with some difficulty and shortness
of breath in his fob. At the same moment he heard a step in the
passage, and the door opened to Adoniram K. Hotchkiss. The Colonel
was impressed; he had a duellist’s respect for punctuality.

The man entered with a nod and the expectant, inquiring look of a
busy man. As his feet crossed that sacred threshold the Colonel
became all courtesy; he placed a chair for his visitor, and took
his hat from his half-reluctant hand. He then opened a cupboard and
brought out a bottle of whiskey and two glasses.

“A—er—slight refreshment, Mr. Hotchkiss,” he suggested, politely.
“I never drink,” replied Hotchkiss, with the severe attitude of a
total abstainer. “Ah—er—not the finest bourbon whiskey, selected by
a Kentucky friend? No? Pardon me! A cigar, then—the mildest Havana.”

“I do not use tobacco nor alcohol in any form,” repeated Hotchkiss,
ascetically. “I have no foolish weaknesses.”

The Colonel’s moist, beady eyes swept silently over his client’s
sallow face. He leaned back comfortably in his chair, and half
closing his eyes as in dreamy reminiscence, said, slowly: “Your
reply, Mr. Hotchkiss, reminds me of—er—sing’lar circumstances
that —er—occurred, in point of fact—at the St. Charles Hotel,
New Orleans. Pinkey Hornblower—personal friend—invited Senator
Doolittle to join him in social glass. Received, sing’larly enough,
reply similar to yours. ‘Don’t drink nor smoke?’ said Pinkey.
‘Gad, sir, you must be mighty sweet on the ladies.’ Ha!” The
Colonel paused long enough to allow the faint flush to pass from
Hotchkiss’s cheek, and went on, half closing his eyes: “‘I allow no
man, sir, to discuss my personal habits,’ said Doolittle, over his
shirt collar. ‘Then I reckon shootin’ must be one of those habits,’
said Pinkey, coolly. Both men drove out on the Shell Road back of
cemetery next morning. Pinkey put bullet at twelve paces through
Doolittle’s temple. Poor Doo never spoke again. Left three wives
and seven children, they say —two of ’em black.”

“I got a note from you this morning,” said Hotchkiss, with badly
concealed impatience. “I suppose in reference to our case. You
have taken judgment, I believe.” The Colonel, without replying,
slowly filled a glass of whiskey and water. For a moment he held it
dreamily before him, as if still engaged in gentle reminiscences
called up by the act. Then tossing it off, he wiped his lips with
a large white handkerchief, and leaning back comfortably in his
chair, said, with a wave of his hand, “The interview I requested,
Mr. Hotchkiss, concerns a subject—which I may say is—er—er—at
present _not_ of a public or business nature—although _later_ it
might become—er—er—both. It is an affair of some—er—delicacy.”

The Colonel paused, and Mr. Hotchkiss regarded him with increased
impatience. The Colonel, however, continued, with unchanged
deliberation: “It concerns—er—a young lady—a beautiful, high-souled
creature, sir, who, apart from her personal loveliness— er—er—I
may say is of one of the first families of Missouri, and—
er—not—remotely connected by marriage with one of—er—er—my
boyhood’s dearest friends. The latter, I grieve to say, was a pure
invention of the Colonel’s—an oratorical addition to the scanty
information he had obtained the previous day. The young lady,” he
continued, blandly, “enjoys the further distinction of being the
object of such attention from you as would make this interview—
really—a confidential matter—er—er—among friends and—er—er—
relations in present and future. I need not say that the lady I
refer to is Miss Zaidee Juno Hooker, only daughter of Almira Ann
Hooker, relict of Jefferson Brown Hooker, formerly of Boone County,
Kentucky, and latterly of—er—Pike County, Missouri.”

The sallow, ascetic hue of Mr. Hotchkiss’s face had passed through
a livid and then a greenish shade, and finally settled into a
sullen red. “What’s all this about?” he demanded, roughly. The
least touch of belligerent fire came into Starbottle’s eye, but his
bland courtesy did not change. “I believe,” he said, politely, “I
have made myself clear as between—er—gentlemen, though perhaps not
as clear as I should to—er—er—jury.”

Mr. Hotchkiss was apparently struck with some significance in
the lawyer’s reply. “I don’t know,” he said, in a lower and more
cautious voice, “what you mean by what you call ‘my attentions’
to—any one—or how it concerns you. I have not exhausted half a
dozen words with—the person you name—have never written her a
line—nor even called at her house.” He rose with an assumption of
ease, pulled down his waistcoat, buttoned his coat, and took up his
hat. The Colonel did not move. “I believe I have already indicated
my meaning in what I have called ‘your attentions,’” said the
Colonel, blandly, “and given you my ‘concern’ for speaking as—er—er
mutual friend. As to _your_ statement of your relations with Miss
Hooker, I may state that it is fully corroborated by the statement
of the young lady herself in this very office yesterday.”

“Then what does this impertinent nonsense mean? Why am I summoned
here?” said Hotchkiss, furiously.

“Because,” said the Colonel, deliberately, “that statement is
infamously—yes, damnably to your discredit, sir!”

Mr. Hotchkiss was here seized by one of those important and
inconsistent rages which occasionally betray the habitually
cautious and timid man. He caught up the Colonel’s stick, which
was lying on the table. At the same moment the Colonel, without
any apparent effort, grasped it by the handle. To Mr. Hotchkiss’s
astonishment, the stick separated in two pieces, leaving the handle
and about two feet of narrow glittering steel in the Colonel’s
hand. The man recoiled, dropping the useless fragment. The Colonel
picked it up, fitting the shining blade in it, clicked the spring,
and then rising, with a face of courtesy yet of unmistakably
genuine pain, and with even a slight tremor in his voice, said,
gravely:

“Mr. Hotchkiss, I owe you a thousand apologies, sir, that—er— a
weapon should be drawn by me—even through your own inadvertence—
under the sacred protection of my roof, and upon an unarmed man.
I beg your pardon, sir, and I even withdraw the expressions which
provoked that inadvertence. Nor does this apology prevent you from
holding me responsible—personally responsible—_elsewhere_ for an
indiscretion committed in behalf of a lady—my—er—client.”

“Your client? Do you mean you have taken her case? You, the
counsel for the Ditch Company?” said Mr. Hotchkiss, in trembling
indignation.

“Having won _your_ case, sir,” said the Colonel, coolly,
“the—er—usages of advocacy do not prevent me from espousing the
cause of the weak and unprotected.”

“We shall see, sir,” said Hotchkiss, grasping the handle of the
door and backing into the passage. “There are other lawyers who—”

“Permit me to see you out,” interrupted the Colonel, rising
politely.

“—will be ready to resist the attacks of blackmail,” continued
Hotchkiss, retreating along the passage.

“And then you will be able to repeat your remarks to me _in the
street_,” continued the Colonel, bowing, as he persisted in
following his visitor to the door.

But here Mr. Hotchkiss quickly slammed it behind him, and hurried
away. The Colonel returned to his office, and sitting down, took
a sheet of letter paper bearing the inscription “Starbottle and
Stryker, Attorneys and Counsellors,” and wrote the following lines:

  Hooker _versus_ Hotchkiss.

    DEAR MADAM,—Having had a visit from the defendant in above, we
    should be pleased to have an interview with you at 2 P.M.
    to-morrow. Your obedient servants,

  STARBOTTLE AND STRYKER.

This he sealed and despatched by his trusted servant Jim, and then
devoted a few moments to reflection. It was the custom of the
Colonel to act first, and justify the action by reason afterwards.

He knew that Hotchkiss would at once lay the matter before rival
counsel. He knew that they would advise him that Miss Hooker had
“no case”—that she would be nonsuited on her own evidence, and he
ought not to compromise, but be ready to stand trial. He believed,
however, that Hotchkiss feared that exposure, and although his
own instincts had been at first against that remedy, he was now
instinctively in favor of it. He remembered his own power with a
jury; his vanity and his chivalry alike approved of this heroic
method; he was bound by the prosaic facts—he had his own theory
of the case, which no mere evidence could gainsay. In fact, Mrs.
Hooker’s own words that “he was to tell the story in his own way”
actually appeared to him an inspiration and a prophecy.

Perhaps there was something else, due possibly to the lady’s
wonderful eyes, of which he had thought much. Yet it was not her
simplicity that affected him solely; on the contrary, it was her
apparent intelligent reading of the character of her recreant
lover—and of his own! Of all the Colonel’s previous “light” or
“serious” loves none had ever before flattered him in that way. And
it was this, combined with the respect which he had held for their
professional relations, that precluded his having a more familiar
knowledge of his client, through serious questioning, or playful
gallantry. I am not sure it was not part of the charm to have a
rustic _femme incomprise_ as a client.

Nothing could exceed the respect with which he greeted her as she
entered his office the next day. He even affected not to notice
that she had put on her best clothes, and he made no doubt appeared
as when she had first attracted the mature yet faithless attentions
of Deacon Hotchkiss at church. A white virginal muslin was belted
around her slim figure by a blue ribbon, and her Leghorn hat was
drawn around her oval cheek by a bow of the same color. She had a
Southern girl’s narrow feet, encased in white stockings and kid
slippers, which were crossed primly before her as she sat in a
chair, supporting her arm by her faithful parasol planted firmly
on the floor. A faint odor of southernwood exhaled from her, and,
oddly enough, stirred the Colonel with a far-off recollection of a
pine-shaded Sunday school on a Georgia hillside and of his first
love, aged ten, in a short, starched frock. Possibly it was the
same recollection that revived something of the awkwardness he had
felt then.

He, however, smiled vaguely and, sitting down, coughed slightly,
and placed his fingertips together. “I have had an—er—interview
with Mr. Hotchkiss, but—I—er—regret to say there seems to be
no prospect of—er—compromise.” He paused, and to his surprise
her listless “company” face lit up with an adorable smile. “Of
course!—ketch him!” she said. “Was he mad when you told him?” She
put her knees comfortably together and leaned forward for a reply.

For all that, wild horses could not have torn from the Colonel
a word about Hotchkiss’s anger. “He expressed his intention of
employing counsel—and defending a suit,” returned the Colonel,
affably basking in her smile. She dragged her chair nearer his
desk. “Then you’ll fight him tooth and nail?” she said eagerly;
“you’ll show him up? You’ll tell the whole story your own way?
You’ll give him fits?—and you’ll make him pay? Sure?” she went on,
breathlessly.

“I—er—will,” said the Colonel, almost as breathlessly.

She caught his fat white hand, which was lying on the table,
between her own and lifted it to her lips. He felt her soft
young fingers even through the lisle-thread gloves that encased
them and the warm moisture of her lips upon his skin. He felt
himself flushing—but was unable to break the silence or change his
position. The next moment she had scuttled back with her chair to
her old position.

“I—er—certainly shall do my best,” stammered the Colonel, in an
attempt to recover his dignity and composure.

“That’s enough! You’ll _do_ it,” said the girl, enthusiastically.
“Lordy! Just you talk for _me_ as ye did for _his_ old Ditch
Company, and you’ll fetch it—every time! Why, when you made that
jury sit up the other day—when you got that off about the Merrikan
flag waving equally over the rights of honest citizens banded
together in peaceful commercial pursuits, as well as over the
fortress of official proflig—”

“Oligarchy,” murmured the Colonel, courteously.

“Oligarchy,” repeated the girl, quickly, “my breath was just took
away. I said to maw, ‘Ain’t he too sweet for anything!’ I did,
honest Injin! And when you rolled it all off at the end—never
missing a word—(you didn’t need to mark ’em in a lesson-book, but
had ’em all ready on your tongue), and walked out—Well! I didn’t
know you nor the Ditch Company from Adam, but I could have just run
over and kissed you there before the whole court!”

She laughed, with her face glowing, although her strange eyes were
cast down. Alack! the Colonel’s face was equally flushed, and
his own beady eyes were on his desk. To any other woman he would
have voiced the banal gallantry that he should now, himself, look
forward to that reward, but the words never reached his lips. He
laughed, coughed slightly, and when he looked up again she had
fallen into the same attitude as on her first visit, with her
parasol point on the floor.

“I must ask you to—er—direct your memory—to—er—another point; the
breaking off of the—er—er—er—engagement. Did he—er—give any reason
for it? Or show any cause?”

“No; he never said anything,” returned the girl.

“Not in his usual way?—er—no reproaches out of the hymn-book?—or
the sacred writings?”

“No; he just _quit_.”

“Er—ceased his attentions,” said the Colonel, gravely. “And
naturally you—er—were not conscious of any cause for his doing so.”
The girl raised her wonderful eyes so suddenly and so penetratingly
without reply in any other way that the Colonel could only
hurriedly say: “I see! None, of course!”

At which she rose, the Colonel rising also. “We—shall begin
proceedings at once. I must, however, caution you to answer no
questions nor say anything about this case to any one until you are
in court.”

She answered his request with another intelligent look and a nod.
He accompanied her to the door. As he took her proffered hand he
raised the lisle-thread fingers to his lips with old-fashioned
gallantry. As if that act had condoned for his first omissions and
awkwardness, he became his old-fashioned self again, buttoned his
coat, pulled out his shirt frill, and strutted back to his desk.

A day or two later it was known throughout the town that Zaidee
Hooker had sued Adoniram Hotchkiss for breach of promise, and
that the damages were laid at five thousand dollars. As in those
bucolic days the Western press was under the secure censorship of
a revolver, a cautious tone of criticism prevailed, and any gossip
was confined to personal expression, and even then at the risk of
the gossiper. Nevertheless, the situation provoked the intensest
curiosity. The Colonel was approached—until his statement that he
should consider any attempt to overcome his professional secrecy
a personal reflection withheld further advances. The community
were left to the more ostentatious information of the defendant’s
counsel, Messrs. Kitcham and Bilser, that the case was “ridiculous”
and “rotten,” that the plaintiff would be nonsuited, and the
fire-eating Starbottle would be taught a lesson that he could not
“bully” the law—and there were some dark hints of a conspiracy.
It was even hinted that the “case” was the revengeful and
preposterous outcome of the refusal of Hotchkiss to pay Starbottle
an extravagant fee for his late services to the Ditch Company.
It is unnecessary to say that these words were not reported to
the Colonel. It was, however, an unfortunate circumstance for
the calmer, ethical consideration of the subject that the church
sided with Hotchkiss, as this provoked an equal adherence to
the plaintiff and Starbottle on the part of the larger body of
non-church-goers, who were delighted at a possible exposure of the
weakness of religious rectitude. “I’ve allus had my suspicions o’
them early candle-light meetings down at that gospel shop,” said
one critic, “and I reckon Deacon Hotchkiss didn’t rope in the gals
to attend jest for psalm-singing.” “Then for him to get up and
leave the board afore the game’s finished and try to sneak out of
it,” said another. “I suppose that’s what they call _religious_.”

It was therefore not remarkable that the courthouse three weeks
later was crowded with an excited multitude of the curious and
sympathizing. The fair plaintiff, with her mother, was early in
attendance, and under the Colonel’s advice appeared in the same
modest garb in which she had first visited his office. This and her
downcast modest demeanor were perhaps at first disappointing to the
crowd, who had evidently expected a paragon of loveliness—as the
Circe of the grim ascetic defendant, who sat beside his counsel.
But presently all eyes were fixed on the Colonel, who certainly
made up in _his_ appearance any deficiency of his fair client.
His portly figure was clothed in a blue dress-coat with brass
buttons, a buff waistcoat which permitted his frilled shirt front
to become erectile above it, a black satin stock which confined
a boyish turned-down collar around his full neck, and immaculate
drill trousers, strapped over varnished boots. A murmur ran round
the court. “Old ‘Personally Responsible’ had got his war-paint on,”
“The Old War-Horse is smelling powder,” were whispered comments.
Yet for all that the most irreverent among them recognized vaguely,
in this bizarre figure, something of an honored past in their
country’s history, and possibly felt the spell of old deeds and old
names that had once thrilled their boyish pulses. The new District
Judge returned Colonel Starbottle’s profoundly punctilious bow.
The Colonel was followed by his negro servant, carrying a parcel
of hymn-books and Bibles, who, with a courtesy evidently imitated
from his master, placed one before the opposite counsel. This,
after a first curious glance, the lawyer somewhat superciliously
tossed aside. But when Jim, proceeding to the jury-box, placed with
equal politeness the remaining copies before the jury, the opposite
counsel sprang to his feet.

“I want to direct the attention of the Court to this unprecedented
tampering with the jury, by this gratuitous exhibition of matter
impertinent and irrelevant to the issue.”

The Judge cast an inquiring look at Colonel Starbottle.

“May it please the Court,” returned Colonel Starbottle with
dignity, ignoring the counsel, “the defendant’s counsel will
observe that he is already furnished with the matter—which I regret
to say he has treated—in the presence of the Court—and of his
client, a deacon of the church—with—er—-great superciliousness.
When I state to your Honor that the books in question are
hymn-books and copies of the _Holy Scriptures_, and that they are
for the instruction of the jury, to whom I shall have to refer them
in the course of my opening, I believe I am within my rights.”

“The act is certainly unprecedented,” said the Judge, dryly,
“but unless the counsel for the plaintiff expects the jury to
_sing_ from these hymn-books, their introduction is not improper,
and I cannot admit the objection. As defendant’s counsel are
furnished with copies also, they cannot plead ‘surprise,’ as in
the introduction of new matter, and as plaintiff’s counsel relies
evidently upon the jury’s attention to his opening, he would not
be the first person to distract it.” After a pause he added,
addressing the Colonel, who remained standing, “The Court is with
you, sir; proceed.”

But the Colonel remained motionless and statuesque, with folded
arms.

“I have overruled the objection,” repeated the Judge; “you may go
on.”

“I am waiting, your Honor, for the—er—withdrawal by the defendant’s
counsel of the word ‘tampering,’ as refers to myself, and of
‘impertinent,’ as refers to the sacred volumes.”

“The request is a proper one, and I have no doubt will be acceded
to,” returned the Judge, quietly. The defendant’s counsel rose and
mumbled a few words of apology, and the incident closed. There
was, however, a general feeling that the Colonel had in some
way “scored,” and if his object had been to excite the greatest
curiosity about the books, he had made his point.

But impassive of his victory, he inflated his chest, with his right
hand in the breast of his buttoned coat, and began. His usual high
color had paled slightly, but the small pupils of his prominent
eyes glittered like steel. The young girl leaned forward in her
chair with an attention so breathless, a sympathy so quick, and
an admiration so artless and unconscious that in an instant she
divided with the speaker the attention of the whole assemblage. It
was very hot; the court was crowded to suffocation; even the open
windows revealed a crowd of faces outside the building, eagerly
following the Colonel’s words.

He would remind the jury that only a few weeks ago he stood there
as the advocate of a powerful company, then represented by the
present defendant. He spoke then as the champion of strict justice
against legal oppression; no less should he to-day champion the
cause of the unprotected and the comparatively defenseless—save
for that paramount power which surrounds beauty and innocence—even
though the plaintiff of yesterday was the defendant of to-day.
As he approached the court a moment ago he had raised his eyes
and beheld the starry flag flying from its dome—and he knew that
glorious banner was a symbol of the perfect equality, under the
Constitution, of the rich and the poor, the strong and the weak—an
equality which made the simple citizen taken from the plough in
the veld, the pick in the gulch, or from behind the counter in
the mining town, who served on that jury, the equal arbiters of
justice with that highest legal luminary whom they were proud to
welcome on the bench to-day. The Colonel paused, with a stately bow
to the impassive Judge. It was this, he continued, which lifted
his heart as he approached the building. And yet—he had entered it
with an uncertain—he might almost say—a timid step. And why? He
knew, gentlemen, he was about to confront a profound—aye! a sacred
responsibility! Those hymn-books and holy writings handed to the
jury were _not_, as his Honor surmised, for the purpose of enabling
the jury to indulge in—er—preliminary choral exercise! He might,
indeed, say “alas not!” They were the damning, incontrovertible
proofs of the perfidy of the defendant. And they would prove as
terrible a warning to him as the fatal characters upon Belshazzar’s
wall. There was a strong sensation. Hotchkiss turned a sallow
green. His lawyers assumed a careless smile.

It was his duty to tell them that this was not one of those
ordinary “breach-of-promise” cases which were too often the
occasion of ruthless mirth and indecent levity in the courtroom.
The jury would find nothing of that here, There were no
love-letters with the epithets of endearment, nor those mystic
crosses and ciphers which, he had been credibly informed, chastely
hid the exchange of those mutual caresses known as “kisses.” There
was no cruel tearing of the veil from those sacred privacies of the
human affection—there was no forensic shouting out of those fond
confidences meant only for _one_. But there was, he was shocked
to say, a new sacrilegious intrusion. The weak pipings of Cupid
were mingled with the chorus of the saints—the sanctity of the
temple known as the “meeting-house” was desecrated by proceedings
more in keeping with the shrine of Venus—and the inspired writings
themselves were used as the medium of amatory and wanton flirtation
by the defendant in his sacred capacity as Deacon.

The Colonel artistically paused after this thunderous denunciation.
The jury turned eagerly to the leaves of the hymn-books, but
the larger gaze of the audience remained fixed upon the speaker
and the girl, who sat in rapt admiration of his periods. After
the hush, the Colonel continued in a lower and sadder voice:
“There are, perhaps, few of us here, gentlemen—with the exception
of the defendant—who can arrogate to themselves the title of
regular churchgoers, or to whom these humbler functions of the
prayer-meeting, the Sunday-school, and the Bible class are
habitually familiar. Yet”—more solemnly—“down in your hearts is
the deep conviction of our short-comings and failings, and a
laudable desire that others at least should profit by the teachings
we neglect. Perhaps,” he continued, closing his eyes dreamily,
“there is not a man here who does not recall the happy days of his
boyhood, the rustic village spire, the lessons shared with some
artless village maiden, with whom he later sauntered, hand in hand,
through the woods, as the simple rhyme rose upon their lips,

      Always make it a point to have it a rule
      Never to be late at the Sabbath-school.

He would recall the strawberry feasts, the welcome annual picnic,
redolent with hunks of gingerbread and sarsaparilla. How would
they feel to know that these sacred recollections were now forever
profaned in their memory by the knowledge that the defendant was
capable of using such occasions to make love to the larger girls
and teachers, whilst his artless companions were innocently—the
Court will pardon me for introducing what I am credibly informed
is the local expression ‘doing gooseberry’?” The tremulous flicker
of a smile passed over the faces of the listening crowd, and the
Colonel slightly winced. But he recovered himself instantly, and
continued:

“My client, the only daughter of a widowed mother—who has for
years stemmed the varying tides of adversity—in the western
precincts of this town—stands before you to-day invested only in
her own innocence. She wears no—er—rich gifts of her faithless
admirer—is panoplied in no jewels, rings, nor mementoes of
affection such as lovers delight to hang upon the shrine of their
affections; hers is not the glory with which Solomon decorated
the Queen of Sheba, though the defendant, as I shall show later,
clothed her in the less expensive flowers of the king’s poetry.
No! gentlemen! The defendant exhibited in this affair a certain
frugality of—er—pecuniary investment, which I am willing to admit
may be commendable in his class. His only gift was characteristic
alike of his methods and his economy. There is, I understand, a
certain not unimportant feature of religious exercise known as
‘taking a collection.’ The defendant, on this occasion, by the
mute presentation of a tip plate covered with baize, solicited
the pecuniary contributions of the faithful. On approaching the
plaintiff, however, he himself slipped a love-token upon the
plate and pushed it towards her. That love-token was a lozenge—a
small disk, I have reason to believe, concocted of peppermint
and sugar, bearing upon its reverse surface the simple words,
‘I love you!’ I have since ascertained that these disks may be
bought for five cents a dozen—or at considerably less than one
half-cent for the single lozenge. Yes, gentlemen, the words ‘I love
you!‘—the oldest legend of all; the refrain, ‘when the morning
stars sang together’—were presented to the plaintiff by a medium so
insignificant that there is, happily, no coin in the republic low
enough to represent its value.

“I shall prove to you, gentlemen of the jury,” said the Colonel,
solemnly, drawing a _Bible_ from his coat-tail pocket, “that
the defendant, for the last twelve months, conducted an amatory
correspondence with the plaintiff by means of underlined words of
sacred writ and church psalmody, such as ‘beloved,’ ‘precious,’
and ‘dearest,’ occasionally appropriating whole passages which
seemed apposite to his tender passion. I shall call your attention
to one of them. The defendant, while professing to be a total
abstainer—a man who, in my own knowledge, has refused spirituous
refreshment as an inordinate weakness of the flesh, with shameless
hypocrisy underscores with his pencil the following passage and
presents it to the plaintiff. The gentlemen of the jury will find
it in the _Song of Solomon_, page 548, chapter II, verse 5.” After
a pause, in which the rapid rustling of leaves was heard in the
jury-box, Colonel Starbottle declaimed in a pleading, stentorian
voice, “‘Stay me with —er—_flagons_, comfort me with—er—apples—for
I am—er—sick of love.’ Yes, gentlemen!—yes, you may well turn
from those accusing pages and look at the double-faced defendant.
He desires—to—er—be —‘stayed with flagons’! I am not aware, at
present, what kind of liquor is habitually dispensed at these
meetings, and for which the defendant so urgently clamored; but it
will be my duty before this trial is over to discover it, if I have
to summon every barkeeper in this district. For the moment, I will
simply call your attention to the _quantity_. It is not a single
drink that the defendant asks for—not a glass of light and generous
wine, to be shared with his inamorata—but a number of flagons or
vessels, each possibly holding a pint measure—_for himself_!”

The smile of the audience had become a laugh. The Judge looked up
warningly, when his eye caught the fact that the Colonel had again
winced at this mirth. He regarded him seriously. Mr. Hotchkiss’s
counsel had joined in the laugh affectedly, but Hotchkiss himself
was ashy pale. There was also a commotion in the jury-box, a
hurried turning over of leaves, and an excited discussion.

“The gentlemen of the jury,” said the Judge, with official gravity,
“will please keep order and attend only to the speeches of counsel.
Any discussion _here_ is irregular and premature—and must be
reserved for the jury-room—after they have retired.”

The foreman of the jury struggled to his feet. He was a powerful
man, with a good-humored face, and, in spite of his unfelicitous
nickname of “The Bone-Breaker,” had a kindly, simple, but somewhat
emotional nature. Nevertheless, it appeared as if he were laboring
under some powerful indignation.

“Can we ask a question, Judge?” he said, respectfully, although his
voice had the unmistakable Western-American ring in it, as of one
who was unconscious that he could be addressing any but his peers.

“Yes,” said the Judge, good-humoredly.

“We’re finding in this yere piece, out of which the Kernel hes
just bin a-quotin’, some language that me and my pardners allow
hadn’t orter to be read out afore a young lady in court—and we
want to know of you—ez a fair-minded and impartial man—ef this
is the reg’lar kind o’ book given to gals and babies down at the
meetin’-house.”

“The jury will please follow the counsel’s speech, without
comment,” said the Judge, briefly, fully aware that the defendant’s
counsel would spring to his feet, as he did promptly. “The Court
will allow us to explain to the gentlemen that the language they
seem to object to has been accepted by the best theologians for
the last thousand years as being purely mystic. As I will explain
later, those are merely symbols of the Church—”

“Of wot?” interrupted the foreman, in deep scorn.

“Of the Church!”

“We ain’t askin’ any questions o’ _you_—and we ain’t takin’ any
answers,” said the foreman, sitting down promptly.

“I must insist,” said the Judge, sternly, “that the plaintiff’s
counsel be allowed to continue his opening without interruption.
You” (to defendant’s counsel) “will have your opportunity to reply
later.”

The counsel sank down in his seat with the bitter conviction
that the jury was manifestly against him, and the case as good
as lost. But his face was scarcely as disturbed as his client’s,
who, in great agitation, had begun to argue with him wildly, and
was apparently pressing some point against the lawyer’s vehement
opposal. The Colonel’s murky eyes brightened as he still stood
erect with his hand thrust in his breast.

“It will be put to you, gentlemen, when the counsel on the other
side refrains from mere interruption and confines himself to reply,
that my unfortunate client has no action—no remedy at law—because
there were no spoken words of endearment. But, gentlemen, it will
depend upon _you_ to say what are and what are not articulate
expressions of love. We all know that among the lower animals, with
whom you may possibly be called upon to classify the defendant,
there are certain signals more or less harmonious, as the case
may be. The ass brays, the horse neighs, the sheep bleats—the
feathered denizens of the grove call to their mates in more musical
roundelays. These are recognized facts, gentlemen, which you
yourselves, as dwellers among nature in this beautiful land, are
all cognizant of. They are facts that no one would deny—and we
should have a poor opinion of the ass who, at—er—such a supreme
moment, would attempt to suggest that his call was unthinking and
without significance. But, gentlemen, I shall prove to you that
such was the foolish, self-convicting custom of the defendant. With
the greatest reluctance, and the—er—greatest pain, I succeeded in
wresting from the maidenly modesty of my fair client the innocent
confession that the defendant had induced her to correspond
with him in these methods. Picture to yourself, gentlemen, the
lonely moonlight road beside the widow’s humble cottage. It is a
beautiful night, sanctified to the affections, and the innocent
girl is leaning from her casement. Presently there appears upon
the road a slinking, stealthy figure—the defendant, on his way to
church. True to the instruction she has received from him, her
lips part in the musical utterance” (the Colonel lowered his voice
in a faint falsetto, presumably in fond imitation of his fair
client),“‘Kerree!’ Instantly the night became resonant with the
impassioned reply” (the Colonel here lifted his voice in stentorian
tones), “‘Kerrow.’ Again, as he passes, rises the soft ‘Kerree’;
again, as his form is lost in the distance, comes back the deep
‘Kerrow.’”

A burst of laughter, long, loud, and irrepressible, struck the
whole courtroom, and before the Judge could lift his half-composed
face and take his handkerchief from his mouth, a faint “Kerree”
from some unrecognized obscurity of the courtroom was followed by a
loud “Kerrow” from some opposite locality. “The sheriff will clear
the court,” said the Judge, sternly; but alas, as the embarrassed
and choking officials rushed hither and thither, a soft “Kerree”
from the spectators at the window, _outside_ the courthouse, was
answered by a loud chorus of “Kerrows” from the opposite windows,
filled with onlookers. Again the laughter arose everywhere—even the
fair plaintiff herself sat convulsed behind her handkerchief.

The figure of Colonel Starbottle alone remained erect—white and
rigid. And then the Judge, looking up, saw what no one else in the
court had seen—that the Colonel was sincere and in earnest; that
what he had conceived to be the pleader’s most perfect acting,
and most elaborate irony, were the deep, serious, mirthless
_convictions_ of a man without the least sense of humor. There was
a touch of this respect in the Judge’s voice as he said to him,
gently, “You may proceed, Colonel Starbottle.”

“I thank your Honor,” said the Colonel, slowly, “for recognizing
and doing all in your power to prevent an interruption that,
during my thirty years’ experience at the bar, I have never yet
been subjected to without the privilege of holding the instigators
thereof responsible—_personally_ responsible. It is possibly my
fault that I have failed, oratorically, to convey to the gentlemen
of the jury the full force and significance of the defendant’s
signals. I am aware that my voice is singularly deficient in
producing either the dulcet tones of my fair client or the
impassioned vehemence of the defendant’s repose. I will,” continued
the Colonel, with a fatigued but blind fatuity that ignored the
hurriedly knit brows and warning eyes of the Judge, “try again.
The note uttered by my client” (lowering his voice to the faintest
of falsettos) “was ‘Kerree’; the response was ‘Kerrow’”—and the
Colonel’s voice fairly shook the dome above him.

Another uproar of laughter followed this apparently audacious
repetition, but was interrupted by an unlooked-for incident.
The defendant rose abruptly, and tearing himself away from the
withholding hand and pleading protestations of his counsel,
absolutely fled from the courtroom, his appearance outside being
recognized by a prolonged “Kerrow” from the bystanders, which
again and again followed him in the distance. In the momentary
silence which followed, the Colonel’s voice was heard saying, “We
rest here, your Honor,” and he sat down. No less white, but more
agitated, was the face of the defendant’s counsel, who instantly
rose.

“For some unexplained reason, your Honor, my client desires to
suspend further proceedings, with a view to effect a peaceable
compromise with the plaintiff. As he is a man of wealth and
position, he is able and willing to pay liberally for that
privilege. While I, as his counsel, am still convinced of his legal
irresponsibility, as he has chosen, however, to publicly abandon
his rights here, I can only ask your Honor’s permission to suspend
further proceedings until I can confer with Colonel Starbottle.”

“As far as I can follow the pleadings,” said the Judge, gravely,
“the case seems to be hardly one for litigation, and I approve of
the defendant’s course, while I strongly urge the plaintiff to
accept it.”

Colonel Starbottle bent over his fair client. Presently he rose,
unchanged in look or demeanor. “I yield, your Honor, to the wishes
of my client, and—er—lady. We accept.”

Before the court adjourned that day it was known throughout the
town that Adoniram K. Hotchkiss had compromised the suit for four
thousand dollars and costs.

Colonel Starbottle had so far recovered his equanimity as to strut
jauntily towards his office, where he was to meet his fair client.
He was surprised, however, to find her already there, and in
company with a somewhat sheepish-looking young man—a stranger. If
the Colonel had any disappointment in meeting a third party to the
interview, his old-fashioned courtesy did not permit him to show
it. He bowed graciously, and politely motioned them each to a seat.

“I reckoned I’d bring Hiram round with me,” said the young lady,
lifting her searching eyes, after a pause, to the Colonel’s,
“though he was awful shy, and allowed that you didn’t know him from
Adam—or even suspected his existence. But I said, ‘That’s just
where you slip up, Hiram; a pow’ful man like the Colonel knows
everything—and I’ve seen it in his eye.’ Lordy!” she continued,
with a laugh, leaning forward over her parasol, as her eyes again
sought the Colonel’s, “don’t you remember when you asked me if I
loved that old Hotchkiss, and I told you ‘That’s tellin’,’ and you
looked at me, Lordy! I knew _then_ you suspected there was a Hiram
_somewhere_—as good as if I’d told you. Now, you, jest get up,
Hiram, and give the Colonel a good handshake. For if it wasn’t for
_him_ and _his_ searchin’ ways, and _his_ awful power of language,
I wouldn’t hev got that four thousand dollars out o’ that flirty
fool Hotchkiss—enough to buy a farm, so as you and me could get
married! That’s what you owe to _him_. Don’t stand there like a
stuck fool starin’ at him. He won’t eat you—though he’s killed many
a better man. Come, have _I_ got to do _all_ the kissin’!”

It is of record that the Colonel bowed so courteously and so
profoundly that he managed not merely to evade the proffered hand
of the shy Hiram, but to only lightly touch the franker and more
impulsive fingertips of the gentle Zaidee. “I—er—offer my sincerest
congratulations—though I think you—er—overestimate—my—er—powers
of penetration. Unfortunately, a pressing engagement, which may
oblige me also to leave town to-night, forbids my saying more. I
have—er—left the—er—business settlement of this—er—case in the
hands of the lawyers who do my office-work, and who will show you
every attention. And now let me wish you a very good afternoon.”

Nevertheless, the Colonel returned to his private room, and it was
nearly twilight when the faithful Jim entered, to find him sitting
meditatively before his desk. “‘Fo’ God! Kernel—I hope dey ain’t
nuffin de matter, but you’s lookin’ mightly solemn! I ain’t seen
you look dat way, Kernel, since de day pooh Marse Stryker was
fetched home shot froo de head.”

“Hand me down the whiskey, Jim,” said the Colonel, rising slowly.

The negro flew to the closet joyfully, and brought out the bottle.
The Colonel poured out a glass of the spirit and drank it with his
old deliberation.

“You’re quite right, Jim,” he said, putting down his glass, “but
I’m—er—getting old—and—somehow—I am missing poor Stryker damnably!”

THE DUPLICITY OF HARGRAVES[24]

By O. Henry (1862–1910)


When Major Pendleton Talbot, of Mobile, sir, and his daughter,
Miss Lydia Talbot, came to Washington to reside, they selected for
a boarding place a house that stood fifty yards back from one of
the quietest avenues. It was an old-fashioned brick building, with
a portico upheld by tall white pillars. The yard was shaded by
stately locusts and elms, and a catalpa tree in season rained its
pink and white blossoms upon the grass. Rows of high box bushes
lined the fence and walks. It was the Southern style and aspect of
the place that pleased the eyes of the Talbots.

In this pleasant private boarding house they engaged rooms,
including a study for Major Talbot, who was adding the finishing
chapters to his book, _Anecdotes and Reminiscences of the Alabama
Army, Bench, and Bar_.

Major Talbot was of the old, old South. The present day had little
interest or excellence in his eyes. His mind lived in that period
before the Civil War when the Talbots owned thousands of acres
of fine cotton land and the slaves to till them; when the family
mansion was the scene of princely hospitality, and drew its guests
from the aristocracy of the South. Out of that period he had
brought all its old pride and scruples of honor, an antiquated and
punctilious politeness, and (you would think) its wardrobe.

Such clothes were surely never made within fifty years. The Major
was tall, but whenever he made that wonderful, archaic genuflexion
he called a bow, the corners of his frock coat swept the floor.
That garment was a surprise even to Washington, which has long ago
ceased to shy at the frocks and broad-brimmed hats of Southern
Congressmen. One of the boarders christened it a “Father Hubbard,”
and it certainly was high in the waist and full in the skirt.

But the Major, with all his queer clothes, his immense area of
plaited, raveling shirt bosom, and the little black string tie
with the bow always slipping on one side, both was smiled at and
liked in Mrs. Vardeman’s select boarding house. Some of the young
department clerks would often “string him,” as they called it,
getting him started upon the subject dearest to him—the traditions
and history of his beloved Southland. During his talks he would
quote freely from the _Anecdotes and Reminiscences_. But they were
very careful not to let him see their designs, for in spite of his
sixty-eight years he could make the boldest of them uncomfortable
under the steady regard of his piercing gray eyes.

Miss Lydia was a plump, little old maid of thirty-five, with
smoothly drawn, tightly twisted hair that made her look still
older. Old-fashioned, too, she was; but antebellum glory did not
radiate from her as it did from the Major. She possessed a thrifty
common sense, and it was she who handled the finances of the
family, and met all comers when there were bills to pay. The Major
regarded board bills and wash bills as contemptible nuisances. They
kept coming in so persistently and so often. Why, the Major wanted
to know, could they not be filed and paid in a lump sum at some
convenient period—say when the _Anecdotes and Reminiscences_ had
been published and paid for? Miss Lydia would calmly go on with her
sewing and say, “We’ll pay as we go as long as the money lasts, and
then perhaps they’ll have to lump it.”

Most of Mrs. Vardeman’s boarders were away during the day, being
nearly all department clerks and business men; but there was one of
them who was about the house a great deal from morning to night.
This was a young man named Henry Hopkins Hargraves—every one in
the house addressed him by his full name—who was engaged at one of
the popular vaudeville theaters. Vaudeville has risen to such a
respectable plane in the last few years, and Mr. Hargraves was such
a modest and well-mannered person, that Mrs. Vardeman could find no
objection to enrolling him upon her list of boarders.

At the theater Hargraves was known as an all-round dialect
comedian, having a large repertoire of German, Irish, Swede, and
black-face specialties. But Mr. Hargraves was ambitious, and often
spoke of his great desire to succeed in legitimate comedy.

This young man appeared to conceive a strong fancy for Major
Talbot. Whenever that gentleman would begin his Southern
reminiscences, or repeat some of the liveliest of the anecdotes,
Hargraves could always be found, the most attentive among his
listeners.

For a time the Major showed an inclination to discourage the
advances of the “play actor,” as he privately termed him; but soon
the young man’s agreeable manner and indubitable appreciation of
the old gentleman’s stories completely won him over.

It was not long before the two were like old chums. The Major set
apart each afternoon to read to him the manuscript of his book.
During the anecdotes Hargraves never failed to laugh at exactly
the right point. The Major was moved to declare to Miss Lydia one
day that young Hargraves possessed remarkable perception and a
gratifying respect for the old régime. And when it came to talking
of those old days—if Major Talbot liked to talk, Mr. Hargraves was
entranced to listen.

Like almost all old people who talk of the past, the Major loved to
linger over details. In describing the splendid, almost royal, days
of the old planters, he would hesitate until he had recalled the
name of the negro who held his horse, or the exact date of certain
minor happenings, or the number of bales of cotton raised in such
a year; but Hargraves never grew impatient or lost interest. On
the contrary, he would advance questions on a variety of subjects
connected with the life of that time, and he never failed to
extract ready replies.

The fox hunts, the ’possum suppers, the hoe-downs and jubilees in
the negro quarters, the banquets in the plantation-house hall, when
invitations went for fifty miles around; the occasional feuds with
the neighboring gentry; the Major’s duel with Rathbone Culbertson
about Kitty Chalmers, who afterward married a Thwaite of South
Carolina; and private yacht races for fabulous sums on Mobile Bay;
the quaint beliefs, improvident habits, and loyal virtues of the
old slaves—all these were subjects that held both the Major and
Hargraves absorbed for hours at a time.

Sometimes, at night, when the young man would be coming upstairs to
his room after his turn at the theater was over, the Major would
appear at the door of his study and beckon archly to him. Going
in, Hargraves would find a little table set with a decanter, sugar
bowl, fruit, and a big bunch of fresh green mint.

“It occurred to me,” the Major would begin—he was always
ceremonious—“that perhaps you might have found your duties at
the—at your place of occupation—sufficiently arduous to enable you,
Mr. Hargraves, to appreciate what the poet might well have had in
his mind when he wrote, ‘tired Nature’s sweet restorer’—one of our
Southern juleps.”

It was a fascination to Hargraves to watch him make it. He took
rank among artists when he began, and he never varied the process.
With what delicacy he bruised the mint; with what exquisite nicety
he estimated the ingredients; with what solicitous care he capped
the compound with the scarlet fruit glowing against the dark green
fringe! And then the hospitality and grace with which he offered
it, after the selected oat straws had been plunged into its
tinkling depths!

After about four months in Washington, Miss Lydia discovered one
morning that they were almost without money. The _Anecdotes and
Reminiscences_ was completed, but publishers had not jumped at the
collected gems of Alabama sense and wit. The rental of a small
house which they still owned in Mobile was two months in arrears.
Their board money for the month would be due in three days. Miss
Lydia called her father to a consultation.

“No money?” said he with a surprised look. “It is quite annoying to
be called on so frequently for these petty sums, Really, I—”

The Major searched his pockets. He found only a two-dollar bill,
which he returned to his vest pocket.

“I must attend to this at once, Lydia,” he said. “Kindly get me my
umbrella and I will go downtown immediately. The congressman from
our district, General Fulghum, assured me some days ago that he
would use his influence to get my book published at an early date.
I will go to his hotel at once and see what arrangement has been
made.”

With a sad little smile Miss Lydia watched him button his “Father
Hubbard” and depart, pausing at the door, as he always did, to bow
profoundly.

That evening, at dark, he returned. It seemed that Congressman
Fulghum had seen the publisher who had the Major’s manuscript for
reading. That person had said that if the anecdotes, etc., were
carefully pruned down about one-half, in order to eliminate the
sectional and class prejudice with which the book was dyed from end
to end, he might consider its publication.

The Major was in a white heat of anger, but regained his
equanimity, according to his code of manners, as soon as he was in
Miss Lydia’s presence.

“We must have money,” said Miss Lydia, with a little wrinkle above
her nose. “Give me the two dollars, and I will telegraph to Uncle
Ralph for some to-night.”

The Major drew a small envelope from his upper vest pocket and
tossed it on the table.

“Perhaps it was injudicious,” he said mildly, “but the sum was so
merely nominal that I bought tickets to the theater to-night. It’s
a new war drama, Lydia. I thought you would be pleased to witness
its first production in Washington. I am told that the South has
very fair treatment in the play. I confess I should like to see the
performance myself.”

Miss Lydia threw up her hands in silent despair.

Still, as the tickets were bought, they might as well be used. So
that evening, as they sat in the theater listening to the lively
overture, even Miss Lydia was minded to relegate their troubles,
for the hour, to second place. The Major, in spotless linen, with
his extraordinary coat showing only where it was closely buttoned,
and his white hair smoothly roached, looked really fine and
distinguished. The curtain went up on the first act of _A Magnolia
Flower_, revealing a typical Southern plantation scene. Major
Talbot betrayed some interest.

“Oh, see!” exclaimed Miss Lydia, nudging his arm, and pointing to
her program.

The Major put on his glasses and read the line in the cast of
characters that her fingers indicated.

Col. Webster Calhoun .... Mr. Hopkins Hargraves.

“It’s our Mr. Hargraves,” said Miss Lydia. “It must be his first
appearance in what he calls ‘the legitimate.’ I’m so glad for him.”

Not until the second act did Col. Webster Calhoun appear upon the
stage. When he made his entry Major Talbot gave an audible sniff,
glared at him, and seemed to freeze solid. Miss Lydia uttered a
little, ambiguous squeak and crumpled her program in her hand.
For Colonel Calhoun was made up as nearly resembling Major Talbot
as one pea does another. The long, thin white hair, curly at the
ends, the aristocratic beak of a nose, the crumpled, wide, raveling
shirt front, the string tie, with the bow nearly under one ear,
were almost exactly duplicated. And then, to clinch the imitation,
he wore the twin to the Major’s supposed to be unparalleled coat.
High-collared, baggy, empire-waisted, ample-skirted, hanging a foot
lower in front than behind, the garment could have been designed
from no other pattern. From then on, the Major and Miss Lydia
sat bewitched, and saw the counterfeit presentment of a haughty
Talbot “dragged,” as the Major afterward expressed it, “through the
slanderous mire of a corrupt stage.”

Mr. Hargraves had used his opportunities well. He had caught the
Major’s little idiosyncrasies of speech, accent, and intonation
and his pompous courtliness to perfection—exaggerating all to the
purpose of the stage. When he performed that marvelous bow that
the Major fondly imagined to be the pink of all salutations, the
audience sent forth a sudden round of hearty applause.

Miss Lydia sat immovable, not daring to glance toward her father.
Sometimes her hand next to him would be laid against her cheek, as
if to conceal the smile which, in spite of her disapproval, she
could not entirely suppress.

The culmination of Hargraves audacious imitation took place in the
third act. The scene is where Colonel Calhoun entertains a few of
the neighboring planters in his “den.”

Standing at a table in the center of the stage, with his friends
grouped about him, he delivers that inimitable, rambling character
monologue so famous in _A Magnolia Flower_, at the same time that
he deftly makes juleps for the party.

Major Talbot, sitting quietly, but white with indignation, heard
his best stories retold, his pet theories and hobbies advanced
and expanded, and the dream of the _Anecdotes and Reminiscences_
served, exaggerated and garbled. His favorite narrative—that of his
duel with Rathbone Culbertson—was not omitted, and it was delivered
with more fire, egotism, and gusto than the Major himself put into
it.

The monologue concluded with a quaint, delicious, witty little
lecture on the art of concocting a julep, illustrated by the act.
Here Major Talbot’s delicate but showy science was reproduced to a
hair’s breadth—from his dainty handling of the fragrant weed—“the
one-thousandth part of a grain too much pressure, gentlemen,
and you extract the bitterness, instead of the aroma, of this
heaven-bestowed plant”—to his solicitous selection of the oaten
straws.

At the close of the scene the audience raised a tumultuous roar of
appreciation. The portrayal of the type was so exact, so sure and
thorough, that the leading characters in the play were forgotten.
After repeated calls, Hargraves came before the curtain and bowed,
his rather boyish face bright and flushed with the knowledge of
success.

At last Miss Lydia turned and looked at the Major. His thin
nostrils were working like the gills of a fish. He laid both
shaking hands upon the arms of his chair to rise.

“We will go, Lydia,” he said chokingly. “This is an
abominable—desecration.”

Before he could rise, she pulled him back into his seat.

“We will stay it out,” she declared. “Do you want to advertise the
copy by exhibiting the original coat?” So they remained to the end.

Hargraves’s success must have kept him up late that night, for
neither at the breakfast nor at the dinner table did he appear.

About three in the afternoon he tapped at the door of Major
Talbot’s study. The Major opened it, and Hargraves walked in with
his hands full of the morning papers—too full of his triumph to
notice anything unusual in the Major’s demeanor.

“I put it all over ’em last night, Major,” he began exultantly. “I
had my inning, and, I think, scored. Here’s what _The Post_ says:

“‘His conception and portrayal of the old-time Southern colonel,
with his absurd grandiloquence, his eccentric garb, his quaint
idioms and phrases, his motheaten pride of family, and his really
kind heart, fastidious sense of honor, and lovable simplicity, is
the best delineation of a character role on the boards to-day.
The coat worn by Colonel Calhoun is itself nothing less than an
evolution of genius. Mr. Hargraves has captured his public.’

“How does that sound, Major, for a first-nighter?”

“I had the honor”—the Major’s voice sounded ominously frigid—“of
witnessing your very remarkable performance, sir, last night.”

Hargraves looked disconcerted.

“You were there? I didn’t know you ever—I didn’t know you cared for
the theater. Oh, I say, Major Talbot,” he exclaimed frankly, “don’t
you be offended. I admit I did get a lot of pointers from you that
helped out wonderfully in the part. But it’s a type, you know—not
individual. The way the audience caught on shows that. Half the
patrons of that theater are Southerners. They recognized it.”

“Mr. Hargraves,” said the Major, who had remained standing, “you
have put upon me an unpardonable insult. You have burlesqued my
person, grossly betrayed my confidence, and misused my hospitality.
If I thought you possessed the faintest conception of what is the
sign manual of a gentleman, or what is due one, I would call you
out, sir, old as I am. I will ask you to leave the room, sir.”

The actor appeared to be slightly bewildered, and seemed hardly to
take in the full meaning of the old gentleman’s words.

“I am truly sorry you took offense,” he said regretfully. “Up here
we don’t look at things just as you people do. I know men who would
buy out half the house to have their personality put on the stage
so the public would recognize it.”

“They are not from Alabama, sir,” said the Major haughtily.

“Perhaps not. I have a pretty good memory, Major; let me quote
a few lines from your book. In response to a toast at a banquet
given in—Milledgeville, I believe—you uttered, and intend to have
printed, these words:

“‘The Northern man is utterly without sentiment or warmth except
in so far as the feelings may be turned to his own commercial
profit. He will suffer without resentment any imputation cast upon
the honor of himself or his loved ones that does not bear with
it the consequence of pecuniary loss. In his charity, he gives
with a liberal hand; but it must be heralded with the trumpet and
chronicled in brass.’

“Do you think that picture is fairer than the one you saw of
Colonel Calhoun last night?”

“The description,” said the Major, frowning, “is—not without
grounds. Some exag—latitude must be allowed in public speaking.”

“And in public acting,” replied Hargraves.

“That is not the point,” persisted the Major, unrelenting. “It was
a personal caricature. I positively decline to overlook it, sir.”

“Major Talbot,” said Hargraves, with a winning smile, “I wish you
would understand me. I want you to know that I never dreamed of
insulting you. In my profession, all life belongs to me. I take
what I want, and what I can, and return it over the footlights.
Now, if you will, let’s let it go at that. I came in to see you
about something else. We’ve been pretty good friends for some
months, and I’m going to take the risk of offending you again.
I know you are hard up for money—never mind how I found out, a
boarding house is no place to keep such matters secret—and I want
you to let me help you out of the pinch. I’ve been there often
enough myself. I’ve been getting a fair salary all the season, and
I’ve saved some money. You’re welcome to a couple hundred—or even
more—until you get——”

“Stop!” commanded the Major, with his arm outstretched. “It seems
that my book didn’t lie, after all. You think your money salve will
heal all the hurts of honor. Under no circumstances would I accept
a loan from a casual acquaintance; and as to you, sir, I would
starve before I would consider your insulting offer of a financial
adjustment of the circumstances we have discussed. I beg to repeat
my request relative to your quitting the apartment.”

Hargraves took his departure without another word. He also left
the house the same day, moving, as Mrs. Vardeman explained at the
supper table, nearer the vicinity of the downtown theater, where _A
Magnolia Flower_ was booked for a week’s run.

Critical was the situation with Major Talbot and Miss Lydia. There
was no one in Washington to whom the Major’s scruples allowed him
to apply for a loan. Miss Lydia wrote a letter to Uncle Ralph,
but it was doubtful whether that relative’s constricted affairs
would permit him to furnish help. The Major was forced to make
an apologetic address to Mrs. Vardeman regarding the delayed
payment for board, referring to “delinquent rentals” and “delayed
remittances” in a rather confused strain.

Deliverance came from an entirely unexpected source.

Late one afternoon the door maid came up and announced an old
colored man who wanted to see Major Talbot. The Major asked that
he be sent up to his study. Soon an old darkey appeared in the
doorway, with his hat in hand, bowing, and scraping with one clumsy
foot. He was quite decently dressed in a baggy suit of black. His
big, coarse shoes shone with a metallic luster suggestive of stove
polish. His bushy wool was gray—almost white. After middle life, it
is difficult to estimate the age of a negro. This one might have
seen as many years as had Major Talbot.

“I be bound you don’t know me, Mars’ Pendleton,” were his first
words.

The Major rose and came forward at the old, familiar style of
address. It was one of the old plantation darkeys without a doubt;
but they had been widely scattered, and he could not recall the
voice or face.

“I don’t believe I do,” he said kindly—“unless you will assist my
memory.”

“Don’t you ’member Cindy’s Mose, Mars’ Pendleton, what ’migrated
’mediately after de war?”

“Wait a moment,” said the Major, rubbing his forehead with the
tips of his fingers. He loved to recall everything connected with
those beloved days. “Cindy’s Mose,” he reflected. “You worked among
the horses—breaking the colts. Yes, I remember now. After the
surrender, you took the name of—don’t prompt me—Mitchell, and went
to the West—to Nebraska.”

“Yassir, yassir,”—the old man’s face stretched with a delighted
grin—“dat’s him, dat’s it. Newbraska. Dat’s me—Mose Mitchell. Old
Uncle Mose Mitchell, dey calls me now. Old mars’, your pa, gimme a
pah of dem mule colts when I lef’ fur to staht me goin’ with. You
’member dem colts, Mars’ Pendleton?”

“I don’t seem to recall the colts,” said the Major. “You know.
I was married the first year of the war and living at the old
Follinsbee place. But sit down, sit down, Uncle Mose. I’m glad to
see you. I hope you have prospered.”

Uncle Mose took a chair and laid his hat carefully on the floor
beside it.

“Yessir; of late I done mouty famous. When I first got to
Newbraska, dey folks come all roun’ me to see dem mule colts. Dey
ain’t see no mules like dem in Newbraska. I sold dem mules for
three hundred dollars. Yessir—three hundred.

“Den I open a blacksmith shop, suh, and made some money and bought
some lan’. Me and my old ’oman done raised up seb’m chillun, and
all doin’ well ’cept two of ’em what died. Fo’ year ago a railroad
come along and staht a town slam ag’inst my lan’, and, suh, Mars’
Pendleton, Uncle Mose am worth leb’m thousand dollars in money,
property, and lan’.”

“I’m glad to hear it,” said the Major heartily. “Glad to hear it.”

“And dat little baby of yo’n, Mars’ Pendleton—one what you name
Miss Lyddy—I be bound dat little tad done growed up tell nobody
wouldn’t know her.”

The Major stepped to the door and called: “Lydie, dear, will you
come?”

Miss Lydia, looking quite grown up and a little worried, came in
from her room.

“Dar, now! What’d I tell you? I knowed dat baby done be plum growed
up. You don’t ’member Uncle Mose, child?”

“This is Aunt Cindy’s Mose, Lydia,” explained the Major. “He left
Sunnymead for the West when you were two years old.”

“Well,” said Miss Lydia, “I can hardly be expected to remember you,
Uncle Mose, at that age. And, as you say, I’m ’plum growed up,’ and
was a blessed long time ago. But I’m glad to see you, even if I
can’t remember you.”

And she was. And so was the Major. Something alive and tangible
had come to link them with the happy past. The three sat and
talked over the olden times, the Major and Uncle Mose correcting
or prompting each other as they reviewed the plantation scenes and
days.

The Major inquired what the old man was doing so far from his home.

“Uncle Mose am a delicate,” he explained, “to de grand Baptis’
convention in dis city. I never preached none, but bein’ a residin’
elder in de church, and able fur to pay my own expenses, dey sent
me along.”

“And how did you know we were in Washington?” inquired Miss Lydia.

“Dey’s a cullud man works in de hotel whar I stops, what comes from
Mobile. He told me he seen Mars’ Pendleton comin’ outen dish here
house one mawnin’.

“What I come fur,” continued Uncle Mose, reaching into his
pocket—“besides de sight of home folks—was to pay Mars’ Pendleton
what I owes him.

“Yessir—three hundred dollars.” He handed the Major a roll of
bills. “When I lef’ old mars’ says: ‘‘Take dem mule colts, Mose,
and, if it be so you gits able, pay fur ’em.’ Yessir—dem was his
words. De war had done lef’ old mars’ po’ hisself. Old mars’ bein’
long ago dead, de debt descends to Mars’ Pendleton. Three hundred
dollars. Uncle Mose is plenty able to pay now. When dat railroad
buy my lan’ I laid off to pay fur dem mules. Count de money, Mars’
Pendleton. Dat’s what I sold dem mules fur. Yessir.”

Tears were in Major Talbot’s eyes. He took Uncle Mose’s hand and
laid his other upon his shoulder.

“Dear, faithful, old servitor,” he said in an unsteady voice, “I
don’t mind saying to you that ‘‘Mars’ Pendleton spent his last
dollar in the world a week ago. We will accept this money, Uncle
Mose, since, in a way, it is a sort of payment, as well as a token
of the loyalty and devotion of the old régime. Lydia, my dear, take
the money. You are better fitted than I to manage its expenditure.”

“Take it, honey,” said Uncle Mose. “Hit belongs to you. Hit’s
Talbot money.”

After Uncle Mose had gone, Miss Lydia had a good cry—-for joy; and
the Major turned his face to a corner, and smoked his clay pipe
volcanically.

The succeeding days saw the Talbots restored to peace and ease.
Miss Lydia’s face lost its worried look. The major appeared in a
new frock coat, in which he looked like a wax figure personifying
the memory of his golden age. Another publisher who read the
manuscript of the _Anecdotes and Reminiscences_ thought that, with
a little retouching and toning down of the high lights, he could
make a really bright and salable volume of it. Altogether, the
situation was comfortable, and not without the touch of hope that
is often sweeter than arrived blessings.

One day, about a week after their piece of good luck, a maid
brought a letter for Miss Lydia to her room. The postmark showed
that it was from New York. Not knowing any one there, Miss Lydia,
in a mild flutter of wonder, sat down by her table and opened the
letter with her scissors. This was what she read:

  DEAR MISS TALBOT:

    I thought you might be glad to learn of my good fortune. I have
    received and accepted an offer of two hundred dollars per week
    by a New York stock company to play Colonel Calhoun in _A
    Magnolia Flower_.

    There is something else I wanted you to know. I guess you’d
    better not tell Major Talbot. I was anxious to make him some
    amends for the great help he was to me in studying the part, and
    for the bad humor he was in about it. He refused to let me, so I
    did it anyhow. I could easily spare the three hundred.

  Sincerely yours,
  H. HOPKINS HARGRAVES.

    P.S. How did I play Uncle Mose?

Major Talbot, passing through the hall, saw Miss Lydia’s door open
and stopped.

“Any mail for us this morning, Lydia, dear?” he asked.

Miss Lydia slid the letter beneath a fold of her dress.

“_The Mobile Chronicle_ came,” she said promptly. “It’s on the
table in your study.”

BARGAIN DAY AT TUTT HOUSE[25]

By George Randolph Chester (1869- )


I

Just as the stage rumbled over the rickety old bridge, creaking
and groaning, the sun came from behind the clouds that had frowned
all the way, and the passengers cheered up a bit. The two richly
dressed matrons who had been so utterly and unnecessarily oblivious
to the presence of each other now suspended hostilities for the
moment by mutual and unspoken consent, and viewed with relief the
little, golden-tinted valley and the tree-clad road just beyond.
The respective husbands of these two ladies exchanged a mere
glance, no more, of comfort. They, too, were relieved, though more
by the momentary truce than by anything else. They regretted very
much to be compelled to hate each other, for each had reckoned up
his vis-à-vis as a rather proper sort of fellow, probably a man of
some achievement, used to good living and good company.

Extreme iciness was unavoidable between them, however. When one
stranger has a splendidly preserved blonde wife and the other a
splendidly preserved brunette wife, both of whom have won social
prominence by years of hard fighting and aloofness, there remains
nothing for the two men but to follow the lead, especially when
directly under the eyes of the leaders.

The son of the blonde matron smiled cheerfully as the welcome light
flooded the coach.

He was a nice-looking young man, of about twenty-two, one might
judge, and he did his smiling, though in a perfectly impersonal
and correct sort of manner, at the pretty daughter of the brunette
matron. The pretty daughter also smiled, but her smile was demurely
directed at the trees outside, clad as they were in all the flaming
glory of their autumn tints, glistening with the recent rain and
dripping with gems that sparkled and flashed in the noonday sun as
they fell.

It is marvelous how much one can see out of the corner of the eye,
while seeming to view mere scenery.

The driver looked down, as he drove safely off the bridge, and
shook his head at the swirl of water that rushed and eddied, dark
and muddy, close up under the rotten planking; then he cracked his
whip, and the horses sturdily attacked the little hill.

Thick, overhanging trees on either side now dimmed the light again,
and the two plump matrons once more glared past the opposite
shoulders, profoundly unaware of each other. The husbands took on
the politely surly look required of them. The blonde son’s eyes
still sought the brunette daughter, but it was furtively done and
quite unsuccessfully, for the daughter was now doing a little
glaring on her own account. The blonde matron had just swept her
eyes across the daughter’s skirt, estimating the fit and material
of it with contempt so artistically veiled that it could almost be
understood in the dark.


II

The big bays swung to the brow of the hill with ease, and dashed
into a small circular clearing, where a quaint little two-story
building, with a mossy watering-trough out in front, nestled under
the shade of majestic old trees that reared their brown and scarlet
crowns proudly into the sky. A long, low porch ran across the front
of the structure, and a complaining sign hung out announcing, in
dim, weather-flecked letters on a cracked board, that this was the
“Tutt House.” A gray-headed man, in brown overalls and faded blue
jumper, stood on the porch and shook his fist at the stage as it
whirled by.

“What a delightfully old-fashioned inn!” exclaimed the pretty
daughter. “How I should like to stop there over night!”

“You would probably wish yourself away before morning, Evelyn,”
replied her mother indifferently. “No doubt it would be a mere
siege of discomfort.”

The blonde matron turned to her husband. The pretty daughter had
been looking at the picturesque “inn” between the heads of this
lady and her son.

“Edward, please pull down the shade behind me,” she directed.
“There is quite a draught from that broken window.”

The pretty daughter bit her lip. The brunette matron continued to
stare at the shade in the exact spot upon which her gaze had been
before directed, and she never quivered an eyelash. The young man
seemed very uncomfortable, and he tried to look his apologies to
the pretty daughter, but she could not see him now, not even if her
eyes had been all corners.

They were bowling along through another avenue of trees when the
driver suddenly shouted, “Whoa there!”

The horses were brought up with a jerk that was well nigh fatal to
the assortment of dignity inside the coach. A loud roaring could
be heard, both ahead and in the rear, a sharp splitting like a
fusillade of pistol shots, then a creaking and tearing of timbers.
The driver bent suddenly forward.

“Gid ap!” he cried, and the horses sprang forward with a lurch.
He swung them around a sharp bend with a skillful hand and poised
his weight above the brake as they plunged at terrific speed down
a steep grade. The roaring was louder than ever now, and it became
deafening as they suddenly emerged from the thick underbrush at the
bottom of the declivity.

“Caught, by gravy!” ejaculated the driver, and, for the second
time, he brought the coach to an abrupt stop.

“Do see what is the matter, Ralph,” said the blonde matron
impatiently.

Thus commanded, the young man swung out and asked the driver about
it.

“Paintsville dam’s busted,” he was informed. “I been a-lookin’ fer
it this many a year, an’ this here freshet done it. You see the
holler there? Well, they’s ten foot o’ water in it, an’ it had ort
to be stone dry. The bridge is tore out behind us, an’ we’re stuck
here till that water runs out. We can’t git away till to-morry,
anyways.”

He pointed out the peculiar topography of the place, and Ralph got
back in the coach.

“We’re practically on a flood-made island,” he exclaimed, with one
eye on the pretty daughter, “and we shall have to stop over night
at that quaint, old-fashioned inn we passed a few moments ago.”

The pretty daughter’s eyes twinkled, and he thought he caught a
swift, direct gleam from under the long lashes—but he was not sure.

“Dear me, how annoying,” said the blonde matron, but the brunette
matron still stared, without the slightest trace of interest in
anything else, at the infinitesimal spot she had selected on the
affronting window-shade.

The two men gave sighs of resignation, and cast carefully concealed
glances at each other, speculating on the possibility of a cigar
and a glass, and maybe a good story or two, or possibly even a game
of poker after the evening meal. Who could tell what might or might
not happen?


III

When the stage drew up in front of the little hotel, it found Uncle
Billy Tutt prepared for his revenge. In former days the stage had
always stopped at the Tutt House for the noonday meal. Since the
new railway was built through the adjoining county, however, the
stage trip became a mere twelve-mile, cross-country transfer from
one railroad to another, and the stage made a later trip, allowing
the passengers plenty of time for “dinner” before they started. Day
after day, as the coach flashed by with its money-laden passengers,
Uncle Billy had hoped that it would break down. But this was
better, much better. The coach might be quickly mended, but not the
flood.

“I’m a-goin’ t’ charge ’em till they squeal,” he declared to the
timidly protesting Aunt Margaret, “an’ then I’m goin’ t’ charge ’em
a least mite more, drat ’em!”

He retreated behind the rough wooden counter that did duty as a
desk, slammed open the flimsy, paper-bound “cash book” that served
as a register, and planted his elbows uncompromisingly on either
side of it.

“Let ’em bring in their own traps,” he commented, and Aunt Margaret
fled, ashamed and conscience-smitten, to the kitchen. It seemed
awful.

The first one out of the coach was the husband of the brunette
matron, and, proceeding under instructions, he waited neither for
luggage nor women folk, but hurried straight into the Tutt House.
The other man would have been neck and neck with him in the race,
if it had not been that he paused to seize two suitcases and had
the misfortune to drop one, which burst open and scattered a choice
assortment of lingerie from one end of the dingy coach to the other.

In the confusion of rescuing the fluffery, the owner of the
suitcase had to sacrifice her hauteur and help her husband and
son block up the aisle, while the other matron had the ineffable
satisfaction of being _kept waiting_, at last being enabled to say,
sweetly and with the most polite consideration:

“Will you kindly allow me to pass?”

The blonde matron raised up and swept her skirts back perfectly
flat. She was pale but collected. Her husband was pink but
collected. Her son was crimson and uncollected. The brunette
daughter could not have found an eye anywhere in his countenance as
she rustled out after her mother.

“I do hope that Belmont has been able to secure choice quarters,”
the triumphing matron remarked as her daughter joined her on the
ground. “This place looked so very small that there can scarcely be
more than one comfortable suite in it.”

It was a vital thrust. Only a splendidly cultivated self-control
prevented the blonde matron from retaliating upon the unfortunate
who had muddled things. Even so, her eyes spoke whole shelves of
volumes.

The man who first reached the register wrote, in a straight black
scrawl, “J. Belmont Van Kamp, wife, and daughter.” There being no
space left for his address, he put none down.

“I want three adjoining rooms, en suite if possible,” he demanded.

“Three!” exclaimed Uncle Billy, scratching his head. “Won’t two do
ye? I ain’t got but six bedrooms in th’ house. Me an’ Marg’t sleeps
in one, an’ we’re a-gittin’ too old fer a shake-down on th’ floor.
I’ll have t’ save one room fer th’ driver, an’ that leaves four.
You take two now—-”

Mr. Van Kamp cast a hasty glance out of the window, The other man
was getting out of the coach. His own wife was stepping on the
porch.

“What do you ask for meals and lodging until this time to-morrow?”
he interrupted.

The decisive moment had arrived. Uncle Billy drew a deep breath.

“Two dollars a head!” he defiantly announced. There! It was out! He
wished Margaret had stayed to hear him say it.

The guest did not seem to be seriously shocked, and Uncle Billy was
beginning to be sorry he had not said three dollars, when Mr. Van
Kamp stopped the landlord’s own breath.

“I’ll give you fifteen dollars for the three best rooms in the
house,” he calmly said, and Landlord Tutt gasped as the money
fluttered down under his nose.

“Jis’ take yore folks right on up, Mr. Kamp,” said Uncle Billy,
pouncing on the money. “Th’ rooms is th’ three right along th’ hull
front o’ th’ house. I’ll be up and make on a fire in a minute. Jis’
take th’ _Jonesville Banner_ an’ th’ _Uticky Clarion_ along with
ye.”

As the swish of skirts marked the passage of the Van Kamps up the
wide hall stairway, the other party swept into the room.

The man wrote, in a round flourish, “Edward Eastman Ellsworth,
wife, and son.”

“I’d like three choice rooms, en suite,” he said.

“Gosh!” said Uncle Billy, regretfully. “That’s what Mr. Kamp
wanted, fust off, an’ he got it. They hain’t but th’ little room
over th’ kitchen left. I’ll have to put you an’ your wife in that,
an’ let your boy sleep with th’ driver.”

The consternation in the Ellsworth party was past calculating by
any known standards of measurement. The thing was an outrage! It
was not to be borne! They would not submit to it!

Uncle Billy, however, secure in his mastery of the situation,
calmly quartered them as he had said. “An’ let ’em splutter all
they want to,” he commented comfortably to himself.


IV

The Ellsworths were holding a family indignation meeting on the
broad porch when the Van Ramps came contentedly down for a walk,
and brushed by them with unseeing eyes.

“It makes a perfectly fascinating suite,” observed Mrs. Van Kamp,
in a pleasantly conversational tone that could be easily overheard
by anyone impolite enough to listen. “That delightful old-fashioned
fireplace in the middle apartment makes it an ideal sitting-room,
and the beds are so roomy and comfortable.”

“I just knew it would be like this!” chirruped Miss Evelyn. “I
remarked as we passed the place, if you will remember, how charming
it would be to stop in this dear, quaint old inn over night. All my
wishes seem to come true this year.”

These simple and, of course, entirely unpremeditated remarks were
as vinegar and wormwood to Mrs. Ellsworth, and she gazed after the
retreating Van Kamps with a glint in her eye that would make one
understand Lucretia Borgia at last.

Her son also gazed after the retreating Van Kamp. She had an
exquisite figure, and she carried herself with a most delectable
grace. As the party drew away from the inn she dropped behind the
elders and wandered off into a side path to gather autumn leaves.

Ralph, too, started off for a walk, but naturally not in the same
direction.

“Edward!” suddenly said Mrs. Ellsworth. “I want you to turn those
people out of that suite before night!”

“Very well,” he replied with a sigh, and got up to do it. He had
wrecked a railroad and made one, and had operated successful
corners in nutmegs and chicory. No task seemed impossible. He
walked in to see the landlord.

“What are the Van Kamps paying you for those three rooms?” he asked.

“Fifteen dollars,” Uncle Billy informed him, smoking one of Mr. Van
Kamp’s good cigars and twiddling his thumbs in huge content.

“I’ll give you thirty for them. Just set their baggage outside and
tell them the rooms are occupied.”

“No sir-ree!” rejoined Uncle Billy. “A bargain’s a bargain, an’ I
allus stick to one I make.”

Mr. Ellsworth withdrew, but not defeated. He had never supposed
that such an absurd proposition would be accepted. It was only a
feeler, and he had noticed a wince of regret in his landlord. He
sat down on the porch and lit a strong cigar. His wife did not
bother him. She gazed complacently at the flaming foliage opposite,
and allowed him to think. Getting impossible things was his
business in life, and she had confidence in him.

“I want to rent your entire house for a week,” he announced to
Uncle Billy a few minutes later. It had occurred to him that the
flood might last longer than they anticipated.

Uncle Billy’s eyes twinkled.

“I reckon it kin be did,” he allowed. “I reckon a _ho_-tel man’s
got a right to rent his hull house ary minute.”

“Of course he has. How much do you want?”

Uncle Billy had made one mistake in not asking this sort of folks
enough, and he reflected in perplexity.

“Make me a offer,” he proposed. “Ef it hain’t enough I’ll tell ye.
You want to rent th’ hull place, back lot an’ all?”

“No, just the mere house. That will be enough,” answered the other
with a smile. He was on the point of offering a hundred dollars,
when he saw the little wrinkles about Mr. Tutt’s eyes, and he said
seventy-five.

“Sho, ye’re jokin’!” retorted Uncle Billy. He had been considered a
fine horse-trader in that part of the country. “Make it a hundred
and twenty-five, an’ I’ll go ye.”

Mr. Ellsworth counted out some bills.

“Here’s a hundred,” he said. “That ought to be about right.”

“Fifteen more,” insisted Uncle Billy.

With a little frown of impatience the other counted off the extra
money and handed it over. Uncle Billy gravely handed it back.

“Them’s the fifteen dollars Mr. Kamp give me,” he explained.
“You’ve got the hull house fer a week, an’ o’ course all th’ money
that’s tooken in is your’n. You kin do as ye please about rentin’
out rooms to other folks, I reckon. A bargain’s a bargain, an’ I
allus stick to one I make.”


V

Ralph Ellsworth stalked among the trees, feverishly searching for
squirrels, scarlet leaves, and the glint of a brown walking-dress,
this last not being so easy to locate in sunlit autumn woods. Time
after time he quickened his pace, only to find that he had been
fooled by a patch of dogwood, a clump of haw bushes or even a
leaf-strewn knoll, but at last he unmistakably saw the dress, and
then he slowed down to a careless saunter.

She was reaching up for some brilliantly colored maple leaves, and
was entirely unconscious of his presence, especially after she had
seen him. Her pose showed her pretty figure to advantage, but, of
course, she did not know that. How should she?

Ralph admired the picture very much. The hat, the hair, the gown,
the dainty shoes, even the narrow strip of silken hose that was
revealed as she stood a-uptoe, were all of a deep, rich brown that
proved an exquisite foil for the pink and cream of her cheeks. He
remembered that her eyes were almost the same shade, and wondered
how it was that women-folk happened on combinations in dress that
so well set off their natural charms. The fool!

He was about three trees away, now, and a panic akin to that
which hunters describe as “buck ague” seized him. He decided that
he really had no excuse for coming any nearer. It would not do,
either, to be seen staring at her if she should happen to turn her
head, so he veered off, intending to regain the road. It would be
impossible to do this without passing directly in her range of
vision, and he did not intend to try to avoid it. He had a fine,
manly figure of his own.

He had just passed the nearest radius to her circle and was
proceeding along the tangent that he had laid out for himself, when
the unwitting maid looked carefully down and saw a tangle of roots
at her very feet. She was so unfortunate, a second later, as to
slip her foot in this very tangle and give her ankle ever so slight
a twist.

“Oh!” cried Miss Van Kamp, and Ralph Ellsworth flew to the rescue.
He had not been noticing her at all, and yet he had started to her
side before she had even cried out, which was strange. She had a
very attractive voice.

“May I be of assistance?” he anxiously inquired.

“I think not, thank you,” she replied, compressing her lips to keep
back the intolerable pain, and half-closing her eyes to show the
fine lashes. Declining the proffered help, she extricated her foot,
picked up her autumn branches, and turned away. She was intensely
averse to anything that could be construed as a flirtation, even of
the mildest, he could certainly see that. She took a step, swayed
slightly, dropped the leaves, and clutched out her hand to him.

“It is nothing,” she assured him in a moment, withdrawing the hand
after he had held it quite long enough. “Nothing whatever. I gave
my foot a slight wrench, and turned the least bit faint for a
moment.”

“You must permit me to walk back, at least to the road, with you,”
he insisted, gathering up her armload of branches. “I couldn’t
think of leaving you here alone.”

As he stooped to raise the gay woodland treasures he smiled to
himself, ever so slightly. This was not _his_ first season out,
either.

“Delightful spot, isn’t it?” he observed as they regained the road
and sauntered in the direction of the Tutt House.

“Quite so,” she reservedly answered. She had noticed that smile as
he stooped. He must be snubbed a little. It would be so good for
him.

“You don’t happen to know Billy Evans, of Boston, do you?” he asked.

“I think not. I am but very little acquainted in Boston.”

“Too bad,” he went on. “I was rather in hopes you knew Billy. All
sorts of a splendid fellow, and knows everybody.”

“Not quite, it seems,” she reminded him, and he winced at the
error. In spite of the sly smile that he had permitted to himself,
he was unusually interested.

He tried the weather, the flood, the accident, golf, books and
three good, substantial, warranted jokes, but the conversation
lagged in spite of him. Miss Van Kamp would not for the world have
it understood that this unconventional meeting, made allowable
by her wrenched ankle, could possibly fulfill the functions of a
formal introduction.

“What a ripping, queer old building that is!” he exclaimed, making
one more brave effort as they came in sight of the hotel.

“It is, rather,” she assented. “The rooms in it are as quaint and
delightful as the exterior, too.”

She looked as harmless and innocent as a basket of peaches as she
said it, and never the suspicion of a smile deepened the dimple in
the cheek toward him. The smile was glowing cheerfully away inside,
though. He could feel it, if he could not see it, and he laughed
aloud.

“Your crowd rather got the better of us there,” he admitted with
the keen appreciation of one still quite close to college days.

“Of course, the mater is furious, but I rather look on it as a
lark.”

She thawed like an April icicle.

“It’s perfectly jolly,” she laughed with him. “Awfully selfish of
us, too, I know, but such loads of fun.”

They were close to the Tutt House now, and her limp, that had
entirely disappeared as they emerged from the woods, now became
quite perceptible. There might be people looking out of the
windows, though it is hard to see why that should affect a limp.

Ralph was delighted to find that a thaw had set in, and he made one
more attempt to establish at least a proxy acquaintance.

“You don’t happen to know Peyson Kingsley, of Philadelphia, do you?”

“I’m afraid I don’t,” she replied. “I know so few Philadelphia
people, you see.” She was rather regretful about it this time. He
really was a clever sort of a fellow, in spite of that smile.

The center window in the second floor of the Tutt House swung open,
its little squares of glass flashing jubilantly in the sunlight.
Mrs. Ellsworth leaned out over the sill, from the quaint old
sitting-room of the _Van Kamp apartments_!

“Oh, Ralph!” she called in her most dulcet tones. “Kindly excuse
yourself and come right on up to our suite for a few moments!”


VI

It is not nearly so easy to take a practical joke as to perpetrate
one. Evelyn was sitting thoughtfully on the porch when her father
and mother returned. Mrs. Ellsworth was sitting at the center
window above, placidly looking out. Her eyes swept carelessly over
the Van Kamps, and unconcernedly passed on to the rest of the
landscape.

Mrs. Van Kamp gasped and clutched the arm of her husband. There
was no need. He, too, had seen the apparition. Evelyn now, for the
first time, saw the real humor of the situation. She smiled as she
thought of Ralph. She owed him one, but she never worried about her
debts. She always managed to get them paid, principal and interest.

Mr. Van Kamp suddenly glowered and strode into the Tutt House.
Uncle Billy met him at the door, reflectively chewing a straw, and
handed him an envelope. Mr. Van Kamp tore it open and drew out a
note. Three five-dollar bills came out with it and fluttered to the
porch floor. This missive confronted him:

  MR. J. BELMONT VAN KAMP,

    DEAR SIR: This is to notify you that I have rented the entire
    Tutt House for the ensuing week, and am compelled to assume
    possession of the three second-floor front rooms. Herewith I am
    enclosing the fifteen dollars you paid to secure the suite. You
    are quite welcome to make use, as my guest, of the small room
    over the kitchen. You will find your luggage in that room.
    Regretting any inconvenience that this transaction may cause
    you, I am,

  Yours respectfully,
  EDWARD EASTMAN ELLSWORTH.

Mr. Van Kamp passed the note to his wife and sat down on a large
chair. He was glad that the chair was comfortable and roomy. Evelyn
picked up the bills and tucked them into her waist. She never
overlooked any of her perquisites. Mrs. Van Kamp read the note, and
the tip of her nose became white. She also sat down, but she was
the first to find her voice.

“Atrocious!” she exclaimed. “Atrocious! Simply atrocious, Belmont.
This is a house of public entertainment. They _can’t_ turn us out
in this high-minded manner! Isn’t there a law or something to that
effect?”

“It wouldn’t matter if there was,” he thoughtfully replied. “This
fellow Ellsworth would be too clever to be caught by it. He would
say that the house was not a hotel but a private residence during
the period for which he has rented it.”

Personally, he rather admired Ellsworth. Seemed to be a resourceful
sort of chap who knew how to make money behave itself, and do its
little tricks without balking in the harness.

“Then you can make him take down the sign!” his wife declared.

He shook his head decidedly.

“It wouldn’t do, Belle,” he replied. “It would be spite, not
retaliation, and not at all sportsmanlike. The course you suggest
would belittle us more than it would annoy them. There must be some
other way.”

He went in to talk with Uncle Billy.

“I want to buy this place,” he stated. “Is it for sale?”

“It sartin is!” replied Uncle Billy. He did not merely twinkle this
time. He grinned.

“How much?”

“Three thousand dollars.” Mr. Tutt was used to charging by this
time, and he betrayed no hesitation.

“I’ll write you out a check at once,” and Mr. Van Kamp reached in
his pocket with the reflection that the spot, after all, was an
ideal one for a quiet summer retreat.

“Air you a-goin’ t’ scribble that there three thou-san’ on a piece
o’ paper?” inquired Uncle Billy, sitting bolt upright. “Ef you air
a-figgerin’ on that, Mr. Kamp, jis’ you save yore time. I give a
man four dollars fer one o’ them check things oncet, an’ I owe
myself them four dollars yit.”

Mr. Van Kamp retired in disorder, but the thought of his wife and
daughter waiting confidently on the porch stopped him. Moreover,
the thing had resolved itself rather into a contest between
Ellsworth and himself, and he had done a little making and breaking
of men and things in his own time. He did some gatling-gun thinking
out by the newel-post, and presently rejoined Uncle Billy.

“Mr. Tutt, tell me just exactly what Mr. Ellsworth rented, please,”
he requested.

“Th’ hull house,” replied Billy, and then he somewhat sternly
added: “Paid me spot cash fer it, too.”

Mr. Van Kamp took a wad of loose bills from his trousers pocket,
straightened them out leisurely, and placed them in his bill book,
along with some smooth yellowbacks of eye-bulging denominations.
Uncle Billy sat up and stopped twiddling his thumbs.

“Nothing was said about the furniture, was there?” suavely inquired
Van Kamp.

Uncle Billy leaned blankly back in his chair. Little by little the
light dawned on the ex-horse-trader. The crow’s feet reappeared
about his eyes, his mouth twitched, he smiled, he grinned, then he
slapped his thigh and haw-hawed.

“No!” roared Uncle Billy. “No, there wasn’t, by gum!”

“Nothing but the house?”

“His very own words!” chuckled Uncle Billy. “‘‘Jis’ th’ mere
house,’ says he, an’ he gits it. A bargain’s a bargain, an’ I allus
stick to one I make.”

“How much for the furniture for the week?”

“Fifty dollars!” Mr. Tutt knew how to do business with this kind of
people now, you bet.

Mr. Van Kamp promptly counted out the money.

“Drat it!” commented Uncle Billy to himself. “I could ’a’ got more!”

“Now where can we make ourselves comfortable with this furniture?”

Uncle Billy chirked up. All was not yet lost.

“Waal,” he reflectively drawled, “there’s th’ new barn. It hain’t
been used for nothin’ yit, senct I built it two years ago. I jis’
hadn’t th’ heart t’ put th’ critters in it as long as th’ ole one
stood up.”

The other smiled at this flashlight on Uncle Billy’s character, and
they went out to look at the barn.


VII

Uncle Billy came back from the “Tutt House Annex,” as Mr. Van Kamp
dubbed the barn, with enough more money to make him love all the
world until he got used to having it. Uncle Billy belongs to a
large family.

Mr. Van Kamp joined the women on the porch, and explained the
attractively novel situation to them. They were chatting gaily when
the Ellsworths came down the stairs. Mr. Ellsworth paused for a
moment to exchange a word with Uncle Billy.

“Mr. Tutt,” said he, laughing, “if we go for a bit of exercise will
you guarantee us the possession of our rooms when we come back?”

“Yes sir-ree!” Uncle Billy assured him. “They shan’t nobody take
them rooms away from you fer money, marbles, ner chalk. A bargain’s
a bargain, an’ I allus stick to one I make,” and he virtuously took
a chew of tobacco while he inspected the afternoon sky with a clear
conscience.

“I want to get some of those splendid autumn leaves to decorate our
cozy apartments,” Mrs. Ellsworth told her husband as they passed in
hearing of the Van Kamps. “Do you know those old-time rag rugs are
the most oddly decorative effects that I have ever seen. They are
so rich in color and so exquisitely blended.”

There were reasons why this poisoned arrow failed to rankle, but
the Van Kamps did not trouble to explain. They were waiting for
Ralph to come out and join his parents. Ralph, it seemed, however,
had decided not to take a walk. He had already fatigued himself, he
had explained, and his mother had favored him with a significant
look. She could readily believe him, she had assured him, and had
then left him in scorn.

The Van Kamps went out to consider the arrangement of the barn.
Evelyn returned first and came out on the porch to find a
handkerchief. It was not there, but Ralph was. She was very much
surprised to see him, and she intimated as much.

“It’s dreadfully damp in the woods,” he explained. “By the way,
you don’t happen to know the Whitleys, of Washington, do you? Most
excellent people.”

“I’m quite sorry that I do not,” she replied. “But you will have
to excuse me. We shall be kept very busy with arranging our
apartments.”

Ralph sprang to his feet with a ludicrous expression.

“Not the second floor front suite!” he exclaimed.

“Oh, no! Not at all,” she reassured him.

He laughed lightly.

“Honors are about even in that game,” he said.

“Evelyn,” called her mother from the hall. “Please come and take
those front suite curtains down to the barn.”

“Pardon me while we take the next trick,” remarked Evelyn with a
laugh quite as light and gleeful as his own, and disappeared into
the hall.

He followed her slowly, and was met at the door by her father.

“You are the younger Mr. Ellsworth, I believe,” politely said Mr.
Van Kamp.

“Ralph Ellsworth. Yes, sir.”

“Here is a note for your father. It is unsealed. You are quite at
liberty to read it.”

Mr. Van Kamp bowed himself away, and Ralph opened the note, which
read:

  EDWARD EASTMAN ELLSWORTH, ESQ.,

    DEAR SIR: This is to notify you that I have rented the entire
    furniture of the Tutt House for the ensuing week, and am
    compelled to assume possession of that in the three second floor
    front rooms, as well as all the balance not in actual use by Mr.
    and Mrs. Tutt and the driver of the stage. You are quite welcome,
    however, to make use of the furnishings in the small room over
    the kitchen. Your luggage you will find undisturbed. Regretting
    any inconvenience that this transaction may cause you, I remain,

  Yours respectfully,
  J. BELMONT VAN KAMP.

Ralph scratched his head in amused perplexity. It devolved upon
him to even up the affair a little before his mother came back.
He must support the family reputation for resourcefulness, but it
took quite a bit of scalp irritation before he aggravated the right
idea into being. As soon as the idea came, he went in and made a
hide-bound bargain with Uncle Billy, then he went out into the hall
and waited until Evelyn came down with a huge armload of window
curtains.

“Honors are still even,” he remarked. “I have just bought all the
edibles about the place, whether in the cellar, the house or any of
the surrounding structures, in the ground, above the ground, dead
or alive, and a bargain’s a bargain as between man and man.”

“Clever of you, I’m sure,” commented Miss Van Kamp, reflectively.
Suddenly her lips parted with a smile that revealed a double row of
most beautiful teeth. He meditatively watched the curve of her lips.

“Isn’t that rather a heavy load?” he suggested. “I’d be delighted
to help you move the things, don’t you know.”

“It is quite kind of you, and what the men would call ‘‘game,’ I
believe, under the circumstances,” she answered, “but really it
will not be necessary. We have hired Mr. Tutt and the driver to do
the heavier part of the work, and the rest of it will be really a
pleasant diversion.”

“No doubt,” agreed Ralph, with an appreciative grin. “By the way,
you don’t happen to know Maud and Dorothy Partridge, of Baltimore,
do you? Stunning pretty girls, both of them, and no end of swells.”

“I know so very few people in Baltimore,” she murmured, and tripped
on down to the barn.

Ralph went out on the porch and smoked. There was nothing else that
he could do.


VIII

It was growing dusk when the elder Ellsworths returned, almost
hidden by great masses of autumn boughs.

“You should have been with us, Ralph,” enthusiastically said his
mother. “I never saw such gorgeous tints in all my life. We have
brought nearly the entire woods with us.”

“It was a good idea,” said Ralph. “A stunning good idea. They may
come in handy to sleep on.”

Mrs. Ellsworth turned cold.

“What do you mean?” she gasped.

“Ralph,” sternly demanded his father, “you don’t mean to tell us
that you let the Van Kamps jockey us out of those rooms after all?”

“Indeed, no,” he airily responded. “Just come right on up and see.”

He led the way into the suite and struck a match. One solitary
candle had been left upon the mantel shelf. Ralph thought that this
had been overlooked, but his mother afterwards set him right about
that. Mrs. Van Kamp had cleverly left it so that the Ellsworths
could see how dreadfully bare the place was. One candle in three
rooms is drearier than darkness anyhow.

Mrs. Ellsworth took in all the desolation, the dismal expanse
of the now enormous apartments, the shabby walls, the hideous
bright spots where pictures had hung, the splintered flooring, the
great, gaunt windows—and she gave in. She had met with snub after
snub, and cut after cut, in her social climb, she had had the
cook quit in the middle of an important dinner, she had had every
disconcerting thing possible happen to her, but this—this was the
last _bale_ of straw. She sat down on a suitcase, in the middle of
the biggest room, and cried!

Ralph, having waited for this, now told about the food transaction,
and she hastily pushed the last-coming tear back into her eye.

“Good!” she cried. “They will be up here soon. They will be
compelled to compromise, and they must not find me with red eyes.”

She cast a hasty glance around the room, then, in a sudden panic,
seized the candle and explored the other two. She went wildly
out into the hall, back into the little room over the kitchen,
downstairs, everywhere, and returned in consternation.

“There’s not a single mirror left in the house!” she moaned.

Ralph heartlessly grinned. He could appreciate that this was a
characteristic woman trick, and wondered admiringly whether Evelyn
or her mother had thought of it. However, this was a time for
action.

“I’ll get you some water to bathe your eyes,” he offered, and ran
into the little room over the kitchen to get a pitcher. A cracked
shaving-mug was the only vessel that had been left, but he hurried
down into the yard with it. This was no time for fastidiousness.

He had barely creaked the pump handle when Mr. Van Kamp hurried up
from the barn.

“I beg your pardon, sir,” said Mr. Van Kamp, “but this water
belongs to us. My daughter bought it, all that is in the ground,
above the ground, or that may fall from the sky upon these
premises.”


IX

The mutual siege lasted until after seven o’clock, but it was
rather one-sided. The Van Kamps could drink all the water they
liked, it made them no hungrier. If the Ellsworths ate anything,
however, they grew thirstier, and, moreover, water was necessary
if anything worth while was to be cooked. They knew all this,
and resisted until Mrs. Ellsworth was tempted and fell. She ate
a sandwich and choked. It was heartbreaking, but Ralph had to be
sent down with a plate of sandwiches and an offer to trade them for
water.

Halfway between the pump and the house he met Evelyn coming with a
small pail of the precious fluid. They both stopped stock still;
then, seeing that it was too late to retreat, both laughed and
advanced.

“Who wins now?” bantered Ralph as they made the exchange.

“It looks to me like a misdeal,” she gaily replied, and was moving
away when he called her back.

“You don’t happen to know the Gately’s, of New York, do you?” he
was quite anxious to know.

“I am truly sorry, but I am acquainted with so few people in New
York. We are from Chicago, you know.”

“Oh,” said he blankly, and took the water up to the Ellsworth suite.

Mrs. Ellsworth cheered up considerably when she heard that Ralph
had been met half-way, but her eyes snapped when he confessed that
it was Miss Van Kamp who had met him.

“I hope you are not going to carry on a flirtation with that
overdressed creature,” she blazed.

“Why mother,” exclaimed Ralph, shocked beyond measure. “What right
have you to accuse either this young lady or myself of flirting?
Flirting!”

Mrs. Ellsworth suddenly attacked the fire with quite unnecessary
energy.


X

Down at the barn, the wide threshing floor had been covered with
gay rag-rugs, and strewn with tables, couches, and chairs in
picturesque profusion. Roomy box-stalls had been carpeted deep with
clean straw, curtained off with gaudy bed-quilts, and converted
into cozy sleeping apartments. The mow and the stalls had been
screened off with lace curtains and blazing counterpanes, and the
whole effect was one of Oriental luxury and splendor. Alas, it
was only an “effect”! The red-hot parlor stove smoked abominably,
the pipe carried other smoke out through the hawmow window, only
to let it blow back again. Chill cross-draughts whistled in from
cracks too numerous to be stopped up, and the miserable Van Kamps
could only cough and shiver, and envy the Tutts and the driver,
non-combatants who had been fed two hours before.

Up in the second floor suite there was a roaring fire in the big
fireplace, but there was a chill in the room that no mere fire
could drive away—the chill of absolute emptiness.

A man can outlive hardships that would kill a woman, but a woman
can endure discomforts that would drive a man crazy.

Mr. Ellsworth went out to hunt up Uncle Billy, with an especial
solace in mind. The landlord was not in the house, but the yellow
gleam of a lantern revealed his presence in the woodshed, and Mr.
Ellsworth stepped in upon him just as he was pouring something
yellow and clear into a tumbler from a big jug that he had just
taken from under the flooring.

“How much do you want for that jug and its contents?” he asked,
with a sigh of gratitude that this supply had been overlooked.

Before Mr. Tutt could answer, Mr. Van Kamp hurried in at the door.

“Wait a moment!” he cried. “I want to bid on that!”

“This here jug hain’t fer sale at no price,” Uncle Billy
emphatically announced, nipping all negotiations right in the bud.
“It’s too pesky hard to sneak this here licker in past Marge’t, but
I reckon it’s my treat, gents. Ye kin have all ye want.”

One minute later Mr. Van Kamp and Mr. Ellsworth were seated, one
on a sawbuck and the other on a nail-keg, comfortably eyeing each
other across the work bench, and each was holding up a tumbler
one-third filled with the golden yellow liquid.

“Your health, sir,” courteously proposed Mr. Ellsworth.

“And to you, sir,” gravely replied Mr. Van Kamp.


XI

Ralph and Evelyn happened to meet at the pump, quite accidentally,
after the former had made half a dozen five-minute-apart trips for
a drink. It was Miss Van Kamp, this time, who had been studying on
the mutual acquaintance problem.

“You don’t happen to know the Tylers, of Parkersburg, do you?” she
asked.

“The Tylers! I should say I do!” was the unexpected and
enthusiastic reply. “Why, we are on our way now to Miss Georgiana
Tyler’s wedding to my friend Jimmy Carston. I’m to be best man.”

“How delightful!” she exclaimed. “We are on the way there, too.
Georgiana was my dearest chum at school, and I am to be her ‘‘best
girl.’”

“Let’s go around on the porch and sit down,” said Ralph.


XII

Mr. Van Kamp, back in the woodshed, looked about him with an eye of
content.

“Rather cozy for a woodshed,” he observed. “I wonder if we couldn’t
scare up a little session of dollar limit?”

Both Uncle Billy and Mr. Ellsworth were willing. Death and poker
level all Americans. A fourth hand was needed, however. The stage
driver was in bed and asleep, and Mr. Ellsworth volunteered to find
the extra player.

“I’ll get Ralph,” he said. “He plays a fairly stiff game.” He
finally found his son on the porch, apparently alone, and stated
his errand.

“Thank you, but I don’t believe I care to play this evening,” was
the astounding reply, and Mr. Ellsworth looked closer. He made out,
then, a dim figure on the other side of Ralph.

“Oh! Of course not!” he blundered, and went back to the woodshed.

Three-handed poker is a miserable game, and it seldom lasts long.
It did not in this case. After Uncle Billy had won the only
jack-pot deserving of the name, he was allowed to go blissfully to
sleep with his hand on the handle of the big jug.

After poker there is only one other always available amusement
for men, and that is business. The two travelers were quite well
acquainted when Ralph put his head in at the door.

“Thought I’d find you here,” he explained. “It just occurred to me
to wonder whether you gentlemen had discovered, as yet, that we are
all to be house guests at the Carston-Tyler wedding.”

“Why, no!” exclaimed his father in pleased surprise. “It is a most
agreeable coincidence. Mr. Van Kamp, allow me to introduce my son,
Ralph. Mr. Van Kamp and myself, Ralph, have found out that we shall
be considerably thrown together in a business way from now on. He
has just purchased control of the Metropolitan and Western string
of interurbans.”

“Delighted, I’m sure,” murmured Ralph, shaking hands, and then he
slipped out as quickly as possible. Some one seemed to be waiting
for him.

Perhaps another twenty minutes had passed, when one of the men had
an illuminating idea that resulted, later on, in pleasant relations
for all of them. It was about time, for Mrs. Ellsworth, up in the
bare suite, and Mrs. Van Kamp, down in the draughty barn, both
wrapped up to the chin and both still chilly, had about reached the
limit of patience and endurance.

“Why can’t we make things a little more comfortable for all
concerned?” suggested Mr. Van Kamp. “Suppose, as a starter, that we
have Mrs. Van Kamp give a shiver party down in the barn?”

“Good idea,” agreed Mr. Ellsworth. “A little diplomacy will do it.
Each one of us will have to tell his wife that the other fellow
made the first abject overtures.”

Mr. Van Kamp grinned understandingly, and agreed to the infamous
ruse.

“By the way,” continued Mr. Ellsworth, with a still happier
thought, “you must allow Mrs. Ellsworth to furnish the dinner for
Mrs. Van Kamp’s shiver party.”

“Dinner!” gasped Mr. Van Kamp. “By all means!”

Both men felt an anxious yawning in the region of the appetite,
and a yearning moisture wetted their tongues. They looked at the
slumbering Uncle Billy and decided to see Mrs. Tutt themselves
about a good, hot dinner for six.

“Law me!” exclaimed Aunt Margaret when they appeared at the kitchen
door. “I swan I thought you folks ’u’d never come to yore senses.
Here I’ve had a big pot o’ stewed chicken ready on the stove fer
two mortal hours. I kin give ye that, an’ smashed taters an’
chicken gravy, an’ dried corn, an’ hot corn-pone, an’ currant
jell, an’ strawberry preserves, an’ my own cannin’ o’ peaches, an’
pumpkin-pie an’ coffee. Will that do ye?” Would it _do_! _Would_ it
do!!

As Aunt Margaret talked, the kitchen door swung wide, and the two
men were stricken speechless with astonishment. There, across
from each other at the kitchen table, sat the utterly selfish and
traitorous younger members of the rival houses of Ellsworth and
Van Kamp, deep in the joys of chicken, and mashed potatoes, and
gravy, and hot corn-pone, and all the other “fixings,” laughing and
chatting gaily like chums of years’ standing. They had seemingly
just come to an agreement about something or other, for Evelyn,
waving the shorter end of a broken wishbone, was vivaciously saying
to Ralph:

“A bargain’s a bargain, and I always stick to one I make.”

A CALL[26]

By Grace MacGowan Cooke (1863- )


A boy in an unnaturally clean, country-laundered collar walked down
a long white road. He scuffed the dust up wantonly, for he wished
to veil the all-too-brilliant polish of his cowhide shoes. Also the
memory of the whiteness and slipperiness of his collar oppressed
him. He was fain to look like one accustomed to social diversions,
a man hurried from hall to hall of pleasure, without time between
to change collar or polish boot. He stooped and rubbed a crumb of
earth on his overfresh neck-linen.

This did not long sustain his drooping spirit. He was mentally
adrift upon the _Hints and Helps to Young Men in Business and
Social Relations_, which had suggested to him his present
enterprise, when the appearance of a second youth, taller and
broader than himself, with a shock of light curling hair and a
crop of freckles that advertised a rich soil threw him a lifeline.
He put his thumbs to his lips and whistled in a peculiarly
ear-splitting way. The two boys had sat on the same bench at
Sunday-school not three hours before; yet what a change had come
over the world for one of them since then!

“Hello! Where you goin’, Ab?” asked the newcomer, gruffly.

“Callin’,” replied the boy in the collar, laconically, but with
carefully averted gaze.

“On the girls?” inquired the other, awestruck. In Mount Pisgah you
saw the girls home from night church, socials, or parties; you
could hang over the gate; and you might walk with a girl in the
cemetery of a Sunday afternoon; but to ring a front-door bell and
ask for Miss Heart’s Desire one must have been in long trousers at
least three years—and the two boys confronted in the dusty road had
worn these dignifying garments barely six months.

“Girls,” said Abner, loftily; “I don’t know about girls—I’m just
going to call on one girl—Champe Claiborne.” He marched on as
though the conversation was at an end; but Ross hung upon his
flank. Ross and Champe were neighbors, comrades in all sorts of
mischief; he was in doubt whether to halt Abner and pummel him, or
propose to enlist under his banner.

“Do you reckon you could?” he debated, trotting along by the
irresponsive Jilton boy.

“Run home to your mother,” growled the originator of the plan,
savagely. “You ain’t old enough to call on girls; anybody can see
that; but I am, and I’m going to call on Champe Claiborne.”

Again the name acted as a spur on Ross. “With your collar and boots
all dirty?” he jeered. “They won’t know you’re callin’.”

The boy in the road stopped short in his dusty tracks. He was
an intense creature, and he whitened at the tragic insinuation,
longing for the wholesome stay and companionship of freckle-faced
Ross. “I put the dirt on o’ purpose so’s to look kind of careless,”
he half whispered, in an agony of doubt. “S’pose I’d better go into
your house and try to wash it off? Reckon your mother would let me?”

“I’ve got two clean collars,” announced the other boy, proudly
generous. “I’ll lend you one. You can put it on while I’m getting
ready. I’ll tell mother that we’re just stepping out to do a little
calling on the girls.”

Here was an ally worthy of the cause. Abner welcomed him, in spite
of certain jealous twinges. He reflected with satisfaction that
there were two Claiborne girls, and though Alicia was so stiff
and prim that no boy would ever think of calling on her, there
was still the hope that she might draw Ross’s fire, and leave
him, Abner, to make the numerous remarks he had stored up in his
mind from _Hints and Helps to Young Men in Social and Business
Relations_ to Champe alone.

Mrs. Pryor received them with the easy-going kindness of the mother
of one son. She followed them into the dining-room to kiss and feed
him, with an absent “Howdy, Abner; how’s your mother?”

Abner, big with the importance of their mutual intention, inclined
his head stiffly and looked toward Ross for explanation. He
trembled a little, but it was with delight, as he anticipated the
effect of the speech Ross had outlined. But it did not come.

“I’m not hungry, mother,” was the revised edition which the
freckle-faced boy offered to the maternal ear. “I—we are going over
to Mr. Claiborne’s—on—er—on an errand for Abner’s father.”

The black-eyed boy looked reproach as they clattered up the stairs
to Ross’s room, where the clean collar was produced and a small
stock of ties.

“You’d wear a necktie—wouldn’t you?” Ross asked, spreading them
upon the bureau-top.

“Yes. But make it fall carelessly over your shirt-front,” advised
the student of _Hints and Helps_. “Your collar is miles too big for
me. Say! I’ve got a wad of white chewing-gum; would you flat it out
and stick it over the collar button? Maybe that would fill up some.
You kick my foot if you see me turning my head so’s to knock it
off.”

“Better button up your vest,” cautioned Ross, laboring with the
“careless” fall of his tie.

“Huh-uh! I want ‘‘that easy air which presupposes familiarity with
society’—that’s what it says in my book,” objected Abner.

“Sure!” Ross returned to his more familiar jeering attitude.
“Loosen up all your clothes, then. Why don’t you untie your shoes?
Flop a sock down over one of ’em—that looks ‘‘easy’ all right.”

Abner buttoned his vest. “It gives a man lots of confidence to know
he’s good-looking,” he remarked, taking all the room in front of
the mirror.

Ross, at the wash-stand soaking his hair to get the curl out of it,
grumbled some unintelligible response. The two boys went down the
stairs with tremulous hearts.

“Why, you’ve put on another clean shirt, Rossie!” Mrs. Pryor called
from her chair—mothers’ eyes can see so far! “Well—don’t get into
any dirty play and soil it.” The boys walked in silence—but it was
a pregnant silence; for as the roof of the Claiborne house began to
peer above the crest of the hill, Ross plumped down on a stone and
announced, “I ain’t goin’.”

“Come on,” urged the black-eyed boy. “It’ll be fun—and everybody
will respect us more. Champe won’t throw rocks at us in
recess-time, after we’ve called on her. She couldn’t.”

“Called!” grunted Ross. “I couldn’t make a call any more than a
cow. What’d I say? What’d I do? I can behave all right when you
just go to people’s houses—but a call!”

Abner hesitated. Should he give away his brilliant inside
information, drawn from the _Hints and Helps_ book, and be rivalled
in the glory of his manners and bearing? Why should he not pass on
alone, perfectly composed, and reap the field of glory unsupported?
His knees gave way and he sat down without intending it.

“Don’t you tell anybody and I’ll put you on to exactly what
grown-up gentlemen say and do when they go calling on the girls,”
he began.

“Fire away,” retorted Ross, gloomily. “Nobody will find out from
me. Dead men tell no tales. If I’m fool enough to go, I don’t
expect to come out of it alive.”

Abner rose, white and shaking, and thrusting three fingers into the
buttoning of his vest, extending the other hand like an orator,
proceeded to instruct the freckled, perspiring disciple at his feet.

“‘Hang your hat on the rack, or give it to a servant.’” Ross
nodded intelligently. He could do that.

“‘Let your legs be gracefully disposed, one hand on the knee, the
other—’”

Abner came to an unhappy pause. “I forget what a fellow does
with the other hand. Might stick it in your pocket, loudly, or
expectorate on the carpet. Indulge in little frivolity. Let a rich
stream of conversation flow.’”

Ross mentally dug within himself for sources of rich streams of
conversation. He found a dry soil. “What you goin’ to talk about?”
he demanded, fretfully. “I won’t go a step farther till I know what
I’m goin’ to say when I get there.”

Abner began to repeat paragraphs from _Hints and Helps_. “‘‘It is
best to remark,’” he opened, in an unnatural voice, “‘‘How well you
are looking!’ although fulsome compliments should be avoided. When
seated ask the young lady who her favorite composer is.’”

“What’s a composer?” inquired Ross, with visions of soothing-syrup
in his mind.

“A man that makes up music. Don’t butt in that way; you put me all
out—‘‘composer is. Name yours. Ask her what piece of music she
likes best. Name yours. If the lady is musical, here ask her to
play or sing.’”

This chanted recitation seemed to have a hypnotic effect on the
freckled boy; his big pupils contracted each time Abner came to the
repetend, “Name yours.”

“I’m tired already,” he grumbled; but some spell made him rise and
fare farther.

When they had entered the Claiborne gate, they leaned toward each
other like young saplings weakened at the root and locking branches
to keep what shallow foothold on earth remained.

“You’re goin’ in first,” asserted Ross, but without conviction. It
was his custom to tear up to this house a dozen times a week, on
his father’s old horse or afoot; he was wont to yell for Champe as
he approached, and quarrel joyously with her while he performed
such errand as he had come upon; but he was gagged and hamstrung
now by the hypnotism of Abner’s scheme.

“‘‘Walk quietly up the steps; ring the bell and lay your card on
the servant,’” quoted Abner, who had never heard of a server.

“‘‘Lay your card on the servant!’” echoed Ross. “Cady’d dodge.
There’s a porch to cross after you go up the steps—does it say
anything about that?”

“It says that the card should be placed on the servant,” Abner
reiterated, doggedly. “If Cady dodges, it ain’t any business of
mine. There are no porches in my book. Just walk across it like
anybody. We’ll ask for Miss Champe Claiborne.”

“We haven’t got any cards,” discovered Ross, with hope.

“I have,” announced Abner, pompously. “I had some struck off in
Chicago. I ordered ’em by mail. They got my name Pillow, but
there’s a scalloped gilt border around it. You can write your name
on my card. Got a pencil?”

He produced the bit of cardboard; Ross fished up a chewed stump of
lead pencil, took it in cold, stiff fingers, and disfigured the
square with eccentric scribblings.

“They’ll know who it’s meant for,” he said, apologetically,
“because I’m here. What’s likely to happen after we get rid of the
card?”

“I told you about hanging your hat on the rack and disposing your
legs.”

“I remember now,” sighed Ross. They had been going slower and
slower. The angle of inclination toward each other became more and
more pronounced.

“We must stand by each other,” whispered Abner.

“I will—if I can stand at all,” murmured the other boy, huskily.

“Oh, Lord!” They had rounded the big clump of evergreens and
found Aunt Missouri Claiborne placidly rocking on the front
porch! Directed to mount steps and ring bell, to lay cards upon
the servant, how should one deal with a rosy-faced, plump lady of
uncertain years in a rocking-chair. What should a caller lay upon
her? A lion in the way could not have been more terrifying. Even
retreat was cut off. Aunt Missouri had seen them. “Howdy, boys; how
are you?” she said, rocking peacefully. The two stood before her
like detected criminals.

Then, to Ross’s dismay, Abner sank down on the lowest step of the
porch, the westering sun full in his hopeless eyes. He sat on his
cap. It was characteristic that the freckled boy remained standing.
He would walk up those steps according to plan and agreement, if
at all. He accepted no compromise. Folding his straw hat into a
battered cone, he watched anxiously for the delivery of the card.
He was not sure what Aunt Missouri’s attitude might be if it
were laid on her. He bent down to his companion. “Go ahead,” he
whispered. “Lay the card.”

Abner raised appealing eyes. “In a minute. Give me time,” he
pleaded.

“Mars’ Ross—Mars’ Ross! Head ’em off!” sounded a yell, and Babe,
the house-boy, came around the porch in pursuit of two half-grown
chickens.

“Help him, Rossie,” prompted Aunt Missouri, sharply. “You boys can
stay to supper and have some of the chicken if you help catch them.”

Had Ross taken time to think, he might have reflected that
gentlemen making formal calls seldom join in a chase after the main
dish of the family supper. But the needs of Babe were instant.
The lad flung himself sidewise, caught one chicken in his hat,
while Babe fell upon the other in the manner of a football player.
Ross handed the pullet to the house-boy, fearing that he had done
something very much out of character, then pulled the reluctant
negro toward to the steps.

“Babe’s a servant,” he whispered to Abner, who had sat rigid
through the entire performance. “I helped him with the chickens,
and he’s got to stand gentle while you lay the card on.”

Confronted by the act itself, Abner was suddenly aware that he knew
not how to begin. He took refuge in dissimulation.

“Hush!” he whispered back. “Don’t you see Mr. Claiborne’s come
out?—He’s going to read something to us.”

Ross plumped down beside him. “Never mind the card; tell ’em,” he
urged.

“Tell ’em yourself.”

“No—let’s cut and run.”

“I—I think the worst of it is over. When Champe sees us she’ll—”

Mention of Champe stiffened Ross’s spine. If it had been glorious
to call upon her, how very terrible she would make it should they
attempt calling, fail, and the failure come to her knowledge! Some
things were easier to endure than others; he resolved to stay till
the call was made.

For half an hour the boys sat with drooping heads, and the old
gentleman read aloud, presumably to Aunt Missouri and themselves.
Finally their restless eyes discerned the two Claiborne girls
walking serene in Sunday trim under the trees at the edge of the
lawn. Arms entwined, they were whispering together and giggling a
little. A caller, Ross dared not use his voice to shout nor his
legs to run toward them.

“Why don’t you go and talk to the girls, Rossie?” Aunt Missouri
asked, in the kindness of her heart. “Don’t be noisy—it’s Sunday,
you know—and don’t get to playing anything that’ll dirty up your
good clothes.”

Ross pressed his lips hard together; his heart swelled with the
rage of the misunderstood. Had the card been in his possession, he
would, at that instant, have laid it on Aunt Missouri without a
qualm.

“What is it?” demanded the old gentleman, a bit testily.

“The girls want to hear you read, father,” said Aunt Missouri,
shrewdly; and she got up and trotted on short, fat ankles to the
girls in the arbor. The three returned together, Alicia casting
curious glances at the uncomfortable youths, Champe threatening to
burst into giggles with every breath.

Abner sat hard on his cap and blushed silently. Ross twisted his
hat into a three-cornered wreck.

The two girls settled themselves noisily on the upper step. The
old man read on and on. The sun sank lower. The hills were red
in the west as though a brush fire flamed behind their crests.
Abner stole a furtive glance at his companion in misery, and the
dolor of Ross’s countenance somewhat assuaged his anguish. The
freckle-faced boy was thinking of the village over the hill, a
certain pleasant white house set back in a green yard, past whose
gate, the two-plank sidewalk ran. He knew lamps were beginning to
wink in the windows of the neighbors about, as though the houses
said, “Our boys are all at home—but Ross Pryor’s out trying to call
on the girls, and can’t get anybody to understand it.” Oh, that
he were walking down those two planks, drawing a stick across the
pickets, lifting high happy feet which could turn in at that gate!
He wouldn’t care what the lamps said then. He wouldn’t even mind if
the whole Claiborne family died laughing at him—if only some power
would raise him up from this paralyzing spot and put him behind the
safe barriers of his own home!

The old man’s voice lapsed into silence; the light was becoming
too dim for his reading. Aunt Missouri turned and called over her
shoulder into the shadows of the big hall: “You Babe! Go put two
extra plates on the supper-table.”

The boys grew red from the tips of their ears, and as far as any
one could see under their wilting collars. Abner felt the lump of
gum come loose and slip down a cold spine. Had their intentions
but been known, this inferential invitation would have been most
welcome. It was but to rise up and thunder out, “We came to call on
the young ladies.”

They did not rise. They did not thunder out anything. Babe brought
a lamp and set it inside the window, and Mr. Claiborne resumed his
reading. Champe giggled and said that Alicia made her. Alcia drew
her skirts about her, sniffed, and looked virtuous, and said she
didn’t see anything funny to laugh at. The supper-bell rang. The
family, evidently taking it for granted that the boys would follow,
went in.

Alone for the first time, Abner gave up. “This ain’t any use,” he
complained. “We ain’t calling on anybody.”

“Why didn’t you lay on the card?” demanded Ross, fiercely. “Why
didn’t you say: ‘‘We’ve-just-dropped-into-call-on-Miss-Champe.
It’s-a-pleasant-evening. We-feel-we-must-be-going,’ like you
said you would? Then we could have lifted our hats and got away
decently.”

Abner showed no resentment.

“Oh, if it’s so easy, why didn’t you do it yourself?” he groaned.

“Somebody’s coming,” Ross muttered, hoarsely. “Say it now. Say it
quick.”

The somebody proved to be Aunt Missouri, who advanced only as far
as the end of the hall and shouted cheerfully: “The idea of a
growing boy not coming to meals when the bell rings! I thought you
two would be in there ahead of us. Come on.” And clinging to their
head-coverings as though these contained some charm whereby the
owners might be rescued, the unhappy callers were herded into the
dining-room. There were many things on the table that boys like.
Both were becoming fairly cheerful, when Aunt Missouri checked the
biscuit-plate with: “I treat my neighbors’ children just like I’d
want children of my own treated. If your mothers let you eat all
you want, say so, and I don’t care; but if either of them is a
little bit particular, why, I’d stop at six!”

Still reeling from this blow, the boys finally rose from the table
and passed out with the family, their hats clutched to their
bosoms, and clinging together for mutual aid and comfort. During
the usual Sunday-evening singing Champe laughed till Aunt Missouri
threatened to send her to bed. Abner’s card slipped from his hand
and dropped face up on the floor. He fell upon it and tore it into
infinitesimal pieces.

“That must have been a love-letter,” said Aunt Missouri, in a pause
of the music. “You boys are getting ‘‘most old enough to think
about beginning to call on the girls.” Her eyes twinkled.

Ross growled like a stoned cur. Abner took a sudden dive into
_Hints and Helps_, and came up with, “You flatter us, Miss
Claiborne,” whereat Ross snickered out like a human boy. They all
stared at him.

“It sounds so funny to call Aunt Missouri ‘‘Mis’ Claiborne,’” the
lad of the freckles explained.

“Funny?” Aunt Missouri reddened. “I don’t see any particular joke
in my having my maiden name.”

Abner, who instantly guessed at what was in Ross’s mind, turned
white at the thought of what they had escaped. Suppose he had laid
on the card and asked for Miss Claiborne!

“What’s the matter, Champe?” inquired Ross, in a fairly natural
tone. The air he had drawn into his lungs when he laughed at Abner
seemed to relieve him from the numbing gentility which had bound
his powers since he joined Abner’s ranks.

“Nothing. I laughed because you laughed,” said the girl.

The singing went forward fitfully. Servants traipsed through the
darkened yard, going home for Sunday night. Aunt Missouri went
out and held some low-toned parley with them. Champe yawned with
insulting enthusiasm. Presently both girls quietly disappeared.
Aunt Missouri never returned to the parlor—evidently thinking that
the girls would attend to the final amenities with their callers.
They were left alone with old Mr. Claiborne. They sat as though
bound in their chairs, while the old man read in silence for a
while. Finally he closed his book, glanced about him, and observed
absently:

“So you boys were to spend the night?” Then, as he looked at their
startled faces: “I’m right, am I not? You are to spent the night?”

Oh, for courage to say: “Thank you, no. We’ll be going now. We just
came over to call on Miss Champe.” But thought of how this would
sound in face of the facts, the painful realization that they dared
not say it because they _had_ not said it, locked their lips. Their
feet were lead; their tongues stiff and too large for their mouths.
Like creatures in a nightmare, they moved stiffly, one might have
said creakingly, up the stairs and received each—a bedroom candle!

“Good night, children,” said the absent-minded old man. The two
gurgled out some sounds which were intended for words and doged
behind the bedroom door.

“They’ve put us to bed!” Abner’s black eyes flashed fire. His
nervous hands clutched at the collar Ross had lent him. “That’s
what I get for coming here with you, Ross Pryor!” And tears of
humiliation stood in his eyes.

In his turn Ross showed no resentment. “What I’m worried about is
my mother,” he confessed. “She’s so sharp about finding out things.
She wouldn’t tease me—she’d just be sorry for me. But she’ll think
I went home with you.”

“I’d like to see my mother make a fuss about my calling on the
girls!” growled Abner, glad to let his rage take a safe direction.

“Calling on the girls! Have we called on any girls?” demanded
clear-headed, honest Ross.

“Not exactly—yet,” admitted Abner, reluctantly. “Come on—let’s
go to bed. Mr. Claiborne asked us, and he’s the head of this
household. It isn’t anybody’s business what we came for.”

“I’ll slip off my shoes and lie down till Babe ties up the dog in
the morning,” said Ross. “Then we can get away before any of the
family is up.”

Oh, youth—youth—youth, with its rash promises! Worn out with misery
the boys slept heavily. The first sound that either heard in the
morning was Babe hammering upon their bedroom door. They crouched
guiltily and looked into each other’s eyes. “Let pretend we ain’t
here and he’ll go away,” breathed Abner.

But Babe was made of sterner stuff. He rattled the knob. He turned
it. He put in a black face with a grin which divided it from ear
to ear. “Cady say I mus’ call dem fool boys to breakfus’,” he
announced. “I never named you-all dat. Cady, she say dat.”

“Breakfast!” echoed Ross, in a daze.

“Yessuh, breakfus’,” reasserted Babe, coming entirely into the room
and looking curiously about him. “Ain’t you-all done been to bed at
all?” wrapping his arms about his shoulders and shaking with silent
ecstasies of mirth. The boys threw themselves upon him and ejected
him.

“Sent up a servant to call us to breakfast,” snarled Abner. “If
they’d only sent their old servant to the door in the first place,
all this wouldn’t ’a’ happened. I’m just that way when I get thrown
off the track. You know how it was when I tried to repeat those
things to you—I had to go clear back to the beginning when I got
interrupted.”

“Does that mean that you’re still hanging around here to begin over
and make a call?” asked Ross, darkly. “I won’t go down to breakfast
if you are.”

Abner brightened a little as he saw Ross becoming wordy
in his rage. “I dare you to walk downstairs and say,
‘‘We-just-dropped-in-to-call-on-Miss-Champe’!” he said.

“I—oh—I—darn it all! there goes the second bell. We may as well
trot down.”

“Don’t leave me, Ross,” pleaded the Jilton boy. “I can’t stay
here—and I can’t go down.”

The tone was hysterical. The boy with freckles took his companion
by the arm without another word and marched him down the stairs.
“We may get a chance yet to call on Champe all by herself out on
the porch or in the arbor before she goes to school,” he suggested,
by way of putting some spine into the black-eyed boy.

An emphatic bell rang when they were half-way down the stairs.
Clutching their hats, they slunk into the dining-room. Even Mr.
Claiborne seemed to notice something unusual in their bearing as
they settled into the chairs assigned to them, and asked them
kindly if they had slept well.

It was plain that Aunt Missouri had been posting him as to her
understanding of the intentions of these young men. The state of
affairs gave an electric hilarity to the atmosphere. Babe travelled
from the sideboard to the table, trembling like chocolate pudding.
Cady insisted on bringing in the cakes herself, and grinned as she
whisked her starched blue skirts in and out of the dining-room. A
dimple even showed itself at the corners of pretty Alicia’s prim
little mouth. Champe giggled, till Ross heard Cady whisper:

“Now you got one dem snickerin’ spells agin. You gwine bust yo’
dress buttons off in the back ef you don’t mind.”

As the spirits of those about them mounted, the hearts of the two
youths sank—if it was like this among the Claibornes, what would
it be at school and in the world at large when their failure
to connect intention with result became village talk? Ross bit
fiercely upon an unoffending batter-cake, and resolved to make a
call single-handed before he left the house.

They went out of the dining-room, their hats as ever pressed to
their breasts. With no volition of their own, their uncertain young
legs carried them to the porch. The Claiborne family and household
followed like small boys after a circus procession. When the two
turned, at bay, yet with nothing between them and liberty but a
hypnotism of their own suggestion, they saw the black faces of the
servants peering over the family shoulders.

Ross was the boy to have drawn courage from the desperation of
their case, and made some decent if not glorious ending. But at
the psychological moment there came around the corner of the house
that most contemptible figure known to the Southern plantation,
a shirt-boy—a creature who may be described, for the benefit of
those not informed, as a pickaninny clad only in a long, coarse
cotton shirt. While all eyes were fastened upon him this inglorious
ambassador bolted forth his message:

“Yo’ ma say”—his eyes were fixed upon Abner—“ef yo’ don’ come home,
she gwine come after yo’—an’ cut yo’ into inch pieces wid a rawhide
when she git yo’. Dat jest what Miss Hortense say.”

As though such a book as _Hints and Helps_ had never existed,
Abner shot for the gate—he was but a hobbledehoy fascinated with
the idea of playing gentleman. But in Ross there were the makings
of a man. For a few half-hearted paces, under the first impulse
of horror, he followed his deserting chief, the laughter of the
family, the unrestrainable guffaws of the negroes, sounding in the
rear. But when Champe’s high, offensive giggle, topping all the
others, insulted his ears, he stopped dead, wheeled, and ran to
the porch faster than he had fled from it. White as paper, shaking
with inexpressible rage, he caught and kissed the tittering girl,
violently, noisily, before them all.

The negroes fled—they dared not trust their feelings; even Alicia
sniggered unobtrusively; Grandfather Claiborne chuckled, and Aunt
Missouri frankly collapsed into her rocking-chair, bubbling with
mirth, crying out:

“Good for you, Ross! Seems you did know how to call on the girls,
after all.”

But Ross, paying no attention, walked swiftly toward the gate.
He had served his novitiate. He would never be afraid again.
With cheerful alacrity he dodged the stones flung after him with
friendly, erratic aim by the girl upon whom, yesterday afternoon,
he had come to make a social call.

HOW THE WIDOW WON THE DEACON[27]

By William James Lampton ( -1917)


Of course the Widow Stimson never tried to win Deacon Hawkins, nor
any other man, for that matter. A widow doesn’t have to try to win
a man; she wins without trying. Still, the Widow Stimson sometimes
wondered why the deacon was so blind as not to see how her fine
farm adjoining his equally fine place on the outskirts of the town
might not be brought under one management with mutual benefit to
both parties at interest. Which one that management might become
was a matter of future detail. The widow knew how to run a farm
successfully, and a large farm is not much more difficult to run
than one of half the size. She had also had one husband, and knew
something more than running a farm successfully. Of all of which
the deacon was perfectly well aware, and still he had not been
moved by the merging spirit of the age to propose consolidation.

This interesting situation was up for discussion at the Wednesday
afternoon meeting of the Sisters’ Sewing Society.

“For my part,” Sister Susan Spicer, wife of the Methodist minister,
remarked as she took another tuck in a fourteen-year-old girl’s
skirt for a ten-year-old—“for my part, I can’t see why Deacon
Hawkins and Kate Stimson don’t see the error of their ways and
depart from them.”

“I rather guess _she_ has,” smiled Sister Poteet, the grocer’s
better half, who had taken an afternoon off from the store in order
to be present.

“Or is willing to,” added Sister Maria Cartridge, a spinster still
possessing faith, hope, and charity, notwithstanding she had been
on the waiting list a long time.

“Really, now,” exclaimed little Sister Green, the doctor’s wife,
“do you think it is the deacon who needs urging?”

“It looks that way to me,” Sister Poteet did not hesitate to affirm.

“Well, I heard Sister Clark say that she had heard him call her
‘Kitty’ one night when they were eating ice-cream at the Mite
Society,” Sister Candish, the druggist’s wife, added to the fund of
reliable information on hand.

“‘Kitty,’ indeed!” protested Sister Spicer. “The idea of anybody
calling Kate Stimson ‘Kitty’! The deacon will talk that way to
’most any woman, but if she let him say it to her more than once,
she must be getting mighty anxious, I think.”

“Oh,” Sister Candish hastened to explain, “Sister Clark didn’t say
she had heard him say it twice.’”

“Well, I don’t think she heard him say it once,” Sister Spicer
asserted with confidence.

“I don’t know about that,” Sister Poteet argued. “From all I can
see and hear I think Kate Stimson wouldn’t object to ’most anything
the deacon would say to her, knowing as she does that he ain’t
going to say anything he shouldn’t say.”

“And isn’t saying what he should,” added Sister Green, with a sly
snicker, which went around the room softly.

“But as I was saying—” Sister Spicer began, when Sister Poteet,
whose rocker, near the window, commanded a view of the front gate,
interrupted with a warning, “’Sh-’sh.”

“Why shouldn’t I say what I wanted to when—” Sister Spicer began.

“There she comes now,” explained Sister Poteet, “and as I live the
deacon drove her here in his sleigh, and he’s waiting while she
comes in. I wonder what next,” and Sister Poteet, in conjunction
with the entire society, gasped and held their eager breaths,
awaiting the entrance of the subject of conversation.

Sister Spicer went to the front door to let her in, and she was
greeted with the greatest cordiality by everybody.

“We were just talking about you and wondering why you were so late
coming,” cried Sister Poteet. “Now take off your things and make up
for lost time. There’s a pair of pants over there to be cut down to
fit that poor little Snithers boy.”

The excitement and curiosity of the society were almost more
than could be borne, but never a sister let on that she knew the
deacon was at the gate waiting. Indeed, as far as the widow could
discover, there was not the slightest indication that anybody had
ever heard there was such a person as the deacon in existence.

“Oh,” she chirruped, in the liveliest of humors, “you will have to
excuse me for to-day. Deacon Hawkins overtook me on the way here,
and here said I had simply got to go sleigh-riding with him. He’s
waiting out at the gate now.”

“Is that so?” exclaimed the society unanimously, and rushed to the
window to see if it were really true.

“Well, did you ever?” commented Sister Poteet, generally.

“Hardly ever,” laughed the widow, good-naturedly, “and I don’t want
to lose the chance. You know Deacon Hawkins isn’t asking somebody
every day to go sleighing with him. I told him I’d go if he would
bring me around here to let you know what had become of me, and so
he did. Now, good-by, and I’ll be sure to be present at the next
meeting. I have to hurry because he’ll get fidgety.”

The widow ran away like a lively schoolgirl. All the sisters
watched her get into the sleigh with the deacon, and resumed the
previous discussion with greatly increased interest.

But little recked the widow and less recked the deacon. He had
bought a new horse and he wanted the widow’s opinion of it, for the
Widow Stimson was a competent judge of fine horseflesh. If Deacon
Hawkins had one insatiable ambition it was to own a horse which
could fling its heels in the face of the best that Squire Hopkins
drove. In his early manhood the deacon was no deacon by a great
deal. But as the years gathered in behind him he put off most of
the frivolities of youth and held now only to the one of driving a
fast horse. No other man in the county drove anything faster except
Squire Hopkins, and him the deacon had not been able to throw the
dust over. The deacon would get good ones, but somehow never could
he find one that the squire didn’t get a better. The squire had
also in the early days beaten the deacon in the race for a certain
pretty girl he dreamed about. But the girl and the squire had lived
happily ever after and the deacon, being a philosopher, might have
forgotten the squire’s superiority had it been manifested in this
one regard only. But in horses, too—that graveled the deacon.

“How much did you give for him?” was the widow’s first query, after
they had reached a stretch of road that was good going and the
deacon had let him out for a length or two.

“Well, what do you suppose? You’re a judge.”

“More than I would give, I’ll bet a cookie.”

“Not if you was as anxious as I am to show Hopkins that he can’t
drive by everything on the pike.”

“I thought you loved a good horse because he was a good horse,”
said the widow, rather disapprovingly.

“I do, but I could love him a good deal harder if he would stay in
front of Hopkins’s best.”

“Does he know you’ve got this one?”

“Yes, and he’s been blowing round town that he is waiting to pick
me up on the road some day and make my five hundred dollars look
like a pewter quarter.”

“So you gave five hundred dollars for him, did you?” laughed the
widow.

“Is it too much?”

“Um-er,” hesitated the widow, glancing along the graceful lines of
the powerful trotter, “I suppose not if you can beat the squire.”

“Right you are,” crowed the deacon, “and I’ll show him a thing or
two in getting over the ground,” he added with swelling pride.

“Well, I hope he won’t be out looking for you to-day, with me in
your sleigh,” said the widow, almost apprehensively, “because, you
know, deacon, I have always wanted you to beat Squire Hopkins.”

The deacon looked at her sharply. There was a softness in her
tones that appealed to him, even if she had not expressed such
agreeable sentiments. Just what the deacon might have said or done
after the impulse had been set going must remain unknown, for at
the crucial moment a sound of militant bells, bells of defiance,
jangled up behind them, disturbing their personal absorption, and
they looked around simultaneously. Behind the bells was the squire
in his sleigh drawn by his fastest stepper, and he was alone, as
the deacon was not. The widow weighed one hundred and sixty pounds,
net—which is weighting a horse in a race rather more than the law
allows.

But the deacon never thought of that. Forgetting everything except
his cherished ambition, he braced himself for the contest, took a
twist hold on the lines, sent a sharp, quick call to his horse, and
let him out for all that was in him. The squire followed suit and
the deacon. The road was wide and the snow was worn down smooth.
The track couldn’t have been in better condition. The Hopkins
colors were not five rods behind the Hawkins colors as they got
away. For half a mile it was nip and tuck, the deacon encouraging
his horse and the widow encouraging the deacon, and then the squire
began creeping up. The deacon’s horse was a good one, but he was
not accustomed to hauling freight in a race. A half-mile of it was
as much as he could stand, and he weakened under the strain.

Not handicapped, the squire’s horse forged ahead, and as his nose
pushed up to the dashboard of the deacon’s sleigh, that good man
groaned in agonized disappointment and bitterness of spirit. The
widow was mad all over that Squire Hopkins should take such a mean
advantage of his rival. Why didn’t he wait till another time when
the deacon was alone, as he was? If she had her way she never
would, speak to Squire Hopkins again, nor to his wife, either. But
her resentment was not helping the deacon’s horse to win.

Slowly the squire pulled closer to the front; the deacon’s horse,
realizing what it meant to his master and to him, spurted bravely,
but, struggle as gamely as he might, the odds were too many for
him, and he dropped to the rear. The squire shouted in triumph as
he drew past the deacon, and the dejected Hawkins shrivelled into
a heap on the seat, with only his hands sufficiently alive to hold
the lines. He had been beaten again, humiliated before a woman, and
that, too, with the best horse that he could hope to put against
the ever-conquering squire. Here sank his fondest hopes, here ended
his ambition. From this on he would drive a mule or an automobile.
The fruit of his desire had turned to ashes in his mouth.

But no. What of the widow? She realized, if the deacon did not,
that she, not the squire’s horse, had beaten the deacon’s, and she
was ready to make what atonement she could. As the squire passed
ahead of the deacon she was stirred by a noble resolve. A deep
bed of drifted snow lay close by the side of the road not far in
front. It was soft and safe and she smiled as she looked at it as
though waiting for her. Without a hint of her purpose, or a sign
to disturb the deacon in his final throes, she rose as the sleigh
ran near its edge, and with a spring which had many a time sent her
lightly from the ground to the bare back of a horse in the meadow,
she cleared the robes and lit plump in the drift. The deacon’s
horse knew before the deacon did that something had happened in
his favor, and was quick to respond. With his first jump of relief
the deacon suddenly revived, his hopes came fast again, his blood
retingled, he gathered himself, and, cracking his lines, he shot
forward, and three minutes later he had passed the squire as though
he were hitched to the fence. For a quarter of a mile the squire
made heroic efforts to recover his vanished prestige, but effort
was useless, and finally concluding that he was practically left
standing, he veered off from the main road down a farm lane to
find some spot in which to hide the humiliation of his defeat.
The deacon, still going at a clipping gait, had one eye over his
shoulder as wary drivers always have on such occasions, and when he
saw the squire was off the track he slowed down and jogged along
with the apparent intention of continuing indefinitely. Presently
an idea struck him, and he looked around for the widow. She was
not where he had seen her last. Where was she? In the enthusiasm
of victory he had forgotten her. He was so dejected at the moment
she had leaped that he did not realize what she had done, and two
minutes later he was so elated that, shame on him! he did not care.
With her, all was lost; without her, all was won, and the deacon’s
greatest ambition was to win. But now, with victory perched on his
horse-collar, success his at last, he thought of the widow, and he
did care. He cared so much that he almost threw his horse off his
feet by the abrupt turn he gave him, and back down the pike he flew
as if a legion of squires were after him.

He did not know what injury she might have sustained; She might
have been seriously hurt, if not actually killed. And why? Simply
to make it possible for him to win. The deacon shivered as he
thought of it, and urged his horse to greater speed. The squire,
down the lane, saw him whizzing along and accepted it profanely
as an exhibition for his especial benefit. The deacon now had
forgotten the squire as he had only so shortly before forgotten the
widow. Two hundred yards from the drift into which she had jumped
there was a turn in the road, where some trees shut off the sight,
and the deacon’s anxiety increased momentarily until he reached
this point. From here he could see ahead, and down there in the
middle of the road stood the widow waving her shawl as a banner of
triumph, though she could only guess at results. The deacon came
on with a rush, and pulled up alongside of her in a condition of
nervousness he didn’t think possible to him.

“Hooray! hooray!” shouted the widow, tossing her shawl into the
air. “You beat him. I know you did. Didn’t you? I saw you pulling
ahead at the turn yonder. Where is he and his old plug?”

“Oh, bother take him and his horse and the race and everything. Are
you hurt?” gasped the deacon, jumping out, but mindful to keep the
lines in his hand. “Are you hurt?” he repeated, anxiously, though
she looked anything but a hurt woman.

“If I am,” she chirped, cheerily, “I’m not hurt half as bad as I
would have been if the squire had beat you, deacon. Now don’t you
worry about me. Let’s hurry back to town so the squire won’t get
another chance, with no place for me to jump.”

And the deacon? Well, well, with the lines in the crook of his
elbow the deacon held out his arms to the widow and——. The sisters
at the next meeting of the Sewing Society were unanimously of the
opinion that any woman who would risk her life like that for a
husband was mighty anxious.

GIDEON[28]

By Wells Hastings (1878- )


“An’ de next’ frawg dat houn’ pup seen, he pass him by wide.”

The house, which had hung upon every word, roared with laughter,
and shook with a storming volley of applause. Gideon bowed to
right and to left, low, grinning, assured comedy obeisances; but
as the laughter and applause grew he shook his head, and signaled
quietly for the drop. He had answered many encores, and he was an
instinctive artist. It was part of the fuel of his vanity that his
audience had never yet had enough of him. Dramatic judgment, as
well as dramatic sense of delivery, was native to him, qualities
which the shrewd Felix Stuhk, his manager and exultant discoverer,
recognized and wisely trusted in. Off stage Gideon was watched
over like a child and a delicate investment, but once behind the
footlights he was allowed to go his own triumphant gait.

It was small wonder that Stuhk deemed himself one of the cleverest
managers in the business; that his narrow, blue-shaven face was
continually chiseled in smiles of complacent self-congratulation.
He was rapidly becoming rich, and there were bright prospects of
even greater triumphs, with proportionately greater reward. He had
made Gideon a national character, a headliner, a star of the first
magnitude in the firmament of the vaudeville theater, and all in
six short months. Or, at any rate, he had helped to make him all
this; he had booked him well and given him his opportunity. To be
sure, Gideon had done the rest; Stuhk was as ready as any one to do
credit to Gideon’s ability. Still, after all, he, Stuhk, was the
discoverer, the theatrical Columbus who had had the courage and the
vision.

A now-hallowed attack of tonsilitis had driven him to Florida,
where presently Gideon had been employed to beguile his
convalescence, and guide him over the intricate shallows of that
long lagoon known as the Indian River in search of various fish.
On days when fish had been reluctant Gideon had been lured into
conversation, and gradually into narrative and the relation of
what had appeared to Gideon as humorous and entertaining; and
finally Felix, the vague idea growing big within him, had one day
persuaded his boatman to dance upon the boards of a long pier where
they had made fast for lunch. There, with all the sudden glory of
crystallization, the vague idea took definite form and became the
great inspiration of Stuhk’s career.

Gideon had grown to be to vaudeville much what _Uncle Remus_ is to
literature: there was virtue in his very simplicity. His artistry
itself was native and natural. He loved a good story, and he told
it from his own sense of the gleeful morsel upon his tongue as
no training could have made him. He always enjoyed his story and
himself in the telling. Tales never lost their savor, no matter how
often repeated; age was powerless to dim the humor of the thing,
and as he had shouted and gurgled and laughed over the fun of
things when all alone, or holding forth among the men and women and
little children of his color, so he shouted and gurgled and broke
from sonorous chuckles to musical, falsetto mirth when he fronted
the sweeping tiers of faces across the intoxicating glare of the
footlights. He had that rare power of transmitting something of his
own enjoyments. When Gideon was on the stage, Stuhk used to enjoy
peeping out at the intent, smiling faces of the audience, where
men and women and children, hardened theater-goers and folk fresh
from the country, sat with moving lips and faces lit with an eager
interest and sympathy for the black man strutting in loose-footed
vivacity before them.

“He’s simply unique,” he boasted to wondering local
managers—“unique, and it took me to find him. There he was, a
little black gold-mine, and all of ’em passed him by until I came.
Some eye? What? I guess you’ll admit you have to hand it some to
your Uncle Felix. If that coon’s health holds out, we’ll have all
the money there is in the mint.”

That was Felix’s real anxiety—“If his health holds out.” Gideon’s
health was watched over as if he had been an ailing prince. His
bubbling vivacity was the foundation upon which his charm and his
success were built. Stuhk became a sort of vicarious neurotic,
eternally searching for symptoms in his protégé; Gideon’s tongue,
Gideon’s liver, Gideon’s heart were matters to him of an unfailing
and anxious interest. And of late—of course it might be imagination
—Gideon had shown a little physical falling off. He ate a bit less,
he had begun to move in a restless way, and, worst of all, he
laughed less frequently.

As a matter of fact, there was ground for Stuhk’s apprehension. It
was not all a matter of managerial imagination: Gideon was less
himself. Physically there was nothing the matter with him; he could
have passed his rigid insurance scrutiny as easily as he had done
months before, when his life and health had been insured for a sum
that made good copy for his press-agent. He was sound in every
organ, but there was something lacking in general tone. Gideon
felt it himself, and was certain that a “misery,” that embracing
indisposition of his race, was creeping upon him. He had been fed
well, too well; he was growing rich, too rich; he had all the
praise, all the flattery that his enormous appetite for approval
desired, and too much of it. White men sought him out and made much
of him; white women talked to him about his career; and wherever he
went, women of color—black girls, brown girls, yellow girls—wrote
him of their admiration, whispered, when he would listen, of their
passion and hero-worship. “City niggers” bowed down before him;
the high gallery was always packed with them. Musk-scented notes
scrawled upon barbaric, “high-toned” stationery poured in upon
him. Even a few white women, to his horror and embarrassment,
had written him of love, letters which he straightway destroyed.
His sense of his position was strong in him; he was proud of it.
There might be “folks outer their haids,” but he had the sense to
remember. For months he had lived in a heaven of gratified vanity,
but at last his appetite had begun to falter. He was sated; his
soul longed to wipe a spiritual mouth on the back of a spiritual
hand, and have done. His face, now that the curtain was down and he
was leaving the stage, was doleful, almost sullen.

Stuhk met him anxiously in the wings, and walked with him to his
dressing-room. He felt suddenly very weary of Stuhk.

“Nothing the matter, Gideon, is there? Not feeling sick or
anything?”

“No, Misteh Stuhk; no, seh. Jes don’ feel extry pert, that’s all.”

“But what is it—anything bothering you?”

Gideon sat gloomily before his mirror.

“Misteh Stuhk,” he said at last, “I been steddyin’ it oveh, and I
about come to the delusion that I needs a good po’k-chop. Seems
foolish, I know, but it do’ seem as if a good po’k-chop, fried jes
right, would he’p consid’able to disumpate this misery feelin’
that’s crawlin’ and creepin’ round my sperit.”

Stuhk laughed.

“Pork-chop, eh? Is that the best you can think of? I know what you
mean, though. I’ve thought for some time that you were getting a
little overtrained. What you need is—let me see—yes, a nice bottle
of wine. That’s the ticket; it will ease things up and won’t do you
any harm. I’ll go, with you. Ever had any champagne, Gideon?”

Gideon struggled for politeness.

“Yes, seh, I’s had champagne, and it’s a nice kind of lickeh sho
enough; but, Misteh Stuhk, seh, I don’ want any of them high-tone
drinks to-night, an’ ef yo’ don’ mind, I’d rather amble off ’lone,
or mebbe eat that po’k-chop with some otheh cullud man, ef I kin
fin’ one that ain’ one of them no-’count Carolina niggers. Do you
s’pose yo’ could let me have a little money to-night, Misteh Stuhk?”

Stuhk thought rapidly. Gideon had certainly worked hard, and he was
not dissipated. If he wanted to roam the town by himself, there
was no harm in it. The sullenness still showed in the black face;
Heaven knew what he might do if he suddenly began to balk. Stuhk
thought it wise to consent gracefully.

“Good!” he said. “Fly to it. How much do you want? A hundred?”

“How much is coming to me?”

“About a thousand, Gideon.”

“Well, I’d moughty like five hun’red of it, ef that’s ’greeable to
yo’.”

Felix whistled.

“Five hundred? Pork-chops must be coming high. You don’t want to
carry all that money around, do you?”

Gideon did not answer; he looked very gloomy.

Stuhk hastened to cheer him.

“Of course you can have anything you want. Wait a minute, and I
will get it for you.

“I’ll bet that coon’s going to buy himself a ring or something,” he
reflected as he went in search of the local manager and Gideon’s
money.

But Stuhk was wrong. Gideon had no intention of buying himself
a ring. For the matter of that, he had several that were amply
satisfactory. They had size and sparkle and luster, all the diamond
brilliance that rings need to have; and for none of them had he
paid much over five dollars. He was amply supplied with jewelry in
which he felt perfect satisfaction. His present want was positive,
if nebulous; he desired a fortune in his pocket, bulky, tangible
evidence of his miraculous success. Ever since Stuhk had found him,
life had had an unreal quality for him. His Monte Cristo wealth
was too much like a fabulous, dream-found treasure, money that
could not be spent without danger of awakening. And he had dropped
into the habit of storing it about him, so that in any pocket into
which he plunged his hand he might find a roll of crisp evidence of
reality. He liked his bills to be of all denominations, and some
so large as exquisitely to stagger imagination, others charming by
their number and crispness—the dignified, orange paper of a man
of assured position and wealth-crackling greenbacks the design of
which tinged the whole with actuality. He was specially partial
to engravings of President Lincoln, the particular savior and
patron of his race. This five hundred dollars he was adding to an
unreckoned sum of about two thousand, merely as extra fortification
against a growing sense of gloom. He wished to brace his flagging
spirits with the gay wine of possession, and he was glad, when the
money came, that it was in an elastic-bound roll, so bulky that it
was pleasantly uncomfortable in his pocket as he left his manager.

As he turned into the brilliantly lighted street from the somber
alleyway of the stage entrance, he paused for a moment to glance
at his own name, in three-foot letters of red, before the doors
of the theater. He could read, and the large block type always
pleased him. “THIS WEEK: GIDEON.” That was all. None of the fulsome
praise, the superlative, necessary definition given to lesser
performers. He had been, he remembered, “GIDEON, America’s Foremost
Native Comedian,” a title that was at once boast and challenge.
That necessity was now past, for he was a national character;
any explanatory qualification would have been an insult to the
public intelligence. To the world he was just “Gideon”; that was
enough. It gave him pleasure, as he sauntered along, to see the
announcement repeated on window cards and hoardings.

Presently he came to a window before which he paused in delighted
wonder. It was not a large window; to the casual eye of the
passer-by there was little to draw attention. By day it lighted
the fractional floor space of a little stationer, who supplemented
a slim business by a sub-agency for railroad and steamship lines;
but to-night this window seemed the framework of a marvel of
coincidence. On the broad, dusty sill inside were propped two
cards: the one on the left was his own red-lettered announcement
for the week; the one at the right—oh, world of wonders!—was a
photogravure of that exact stretch of the inner coast of Florida
which Gideon knew best, which was home.

There it was, the Indian River, rippling idly in full sunlight,
palmettos leaning over the water, palmettos standing as irregular
sentries along the low, reeflike island which stretched away out of
the picture. There was the gigantic, lonely pine he knew well, and,
yes—he could just make it out—there was his own ramshackle little
pier, which stretched in undulating fashion, like a long-legged,
wading caterpillar, from the abrupt shore-line of eroded coquina
into deep water.

He thought at first that this picture of his home was some new
and delicate device put forth by his press-agent. His name on
one side of a window, his birthplace upon the other—what could
be more tastefully appropriate? Therefore, as he spelled out
the reading-matter beneath the photogravure, he was sharply
disappointed. It read:

                  Spend this winter in balmy Florida.
                Come to the Land of Perpetual Sunshine.
      Golf, tennis, driving, shooting, boating, fishing, all of
                        the best.

There was more, but he had no heart for it; he was disappointed
and puzzled. This picture had, after all, nothing to do with him.
It was a chance, and yet, what a strange chance! It troubled and
upset him. His black, round-featured face took on deep wrinkles of
perplexity. The “misery” which had hung darkly on his horizon for
weeks engulfed him without warning. But in the very bitterness of
his melancholy he knew at last his disease. It was not champagne
or recreation that he needed, not even a “po’k-chop,” although his
desire for it had been a symptom, a groping for a too homeopathic
remedy: he was homesick.

Easy, childish tears came into his eyes, and ran over his shining
cheeks. He shivered forlornly with a sudden sense of cold, and
absently clutched at the lapels of his gorgeous, fur-lined ulster.

Then in abrupt reaction he laughed aloud, so that the shrill,
musical falsetto startled the passers-by, and in another moment
a little semicircle of the curious watched spellbound as a black
man, exquisitely appareled, danced in wild, loose grace before the
dull background of a somewhat grimy and apparently vacant window. A
newsboy recognized him.

He heard his name being passed from mouth to mouth, and came partly
to his senses. He stopped dancing, and grinned at them.

“Say, you are Gideon, ain’t you?” his discoverer demanded, with a
sort of reverent audacity.

“Yaas, _seh_,” said Gideon; “that’s me. Yo’ shu got it right.” He
broke into a joyous peal of laughter—the laughter that had made him
famous, and bowed deeply before him. “Gideon—posi-_tive_-ly his
las’ puffawmunce.” Turning, he dashed for a passing trolley, and,
still laughing, swung aboard.

He was naturally honest. In a land of easy morality his friends
had accounted him something of a paragon; nor had Stuhk ever had
anything but praise for him. But now he crushed aside the ethics
of his intent without a single troubled thought. Running away has
always been inherent in the negro. He gave one regretful thought to
the gorgeous wardrobe he was leaving behind him; but he dared not
return for it. Stuhk might have taken it into his head to go back
to their rooms. He must content himself with the reflection that he
was at that moment wearing his best.

The trolley seemed too slow for him, and, as always happened
nowadays, he was recognized; he heard his name whispered, and was
aware of the admiring glances of the curious. Even popularity
had its drawbacks. He got down in front of a big hotel and chose
a taxicab from the waiting rank, exhorting the driver to make
his best speed to the station. Leaning back in the soft depths
of the cab, he savored his independence, cheered already by the
swaying, lurching speed. At the station he tipped the driver in
lordly fashion, very much pleased with himself and anxious to give
pleasure. Only the sternest prudence and an unconquerable awe of
uniform had kept him from tossing bills to the various traffic
policemen who had seemed to smile upon his hurry.

No through train left for hours; but after the first disappointment
of momentary check, he decided that he was more pleased than
otherwise. It would save embarrassment. He was going South, where
his color would be more considered than his reputation, and on the
little local he chose there was a “Jim Crow” car—one, that is,
specially set aside for those of his race. That it proved crowded
and full of smoke did not trouble him at all, nor did the admiring
pleasantries which the splendor of his apparel immediately called
forth. No one knew him; indeed, he was naturally enough mistaken
for a prosperous gambler, a not unflattering supposition. In the
yard, after the train pulled out, he saw his private car under a
glaring arc light, and grinned to see it left behind.

He spent the night pleasantly in a noisy game of high-low-jack,
and the next morning slept more soundly than he had slept for
weeks, hunched upon a wooden bench in the boxlike station of a
North Carolina junction. The express would have brought him to
Jacksonville in twenty-four hours; the journey, as he took it,
boarding any local that happened to be going south, and leaving it
for meals or sometimes for sleep or often as the whim possessed
him, filled five happy days. There he took a night train, and dozed
from Jacksonville until a little north of New Smyrna.

He awoke to find it broad daylight, and the car half empty. The
train was on a siding, with news of a freight wreck ahead. Gideon
stretched himself, and looked out of the window, and emotion seized
him. For all his journey the South had seemed to welcome him, but
here at last was the country he knew. He went out upon the platform
and threw back his head, sniffing the soft breeze, heavy with
the mysterious thrill of unplowed acres, the wondrous existence
of primordial jungle, where life has rioted unceasingly above
unceasing decay. It was dry with the fine dust of waste places, and
wet with the warm mists of slumbering swamps; it seemed to Gideon
to tremble with the songs of birds, the dry murmur of palm leaves,
and the almost inaudible whisper of the gray moss that festooned
the live-oaks.

“Um-m-m,” he murmured, apostrophizing it, “yo’ ’s the right kind o’
breeze, yo’ is. Yo’-all’s healthy.” Still sniffing, he climbed down
to the dusty road-bed.

The negroes who had ridden with him were sprawled about him on
the ground; one of them lay sleeping, face up, in the sunlight.
The train had evidently been there for some time, and there were
no signs of an immediate departure. He bought some oranges of a
little, bowlegged black boy, and sat down on a log to eat them and
to give up his mind to enjoyment. The sun was hot upon him, and his
thoughts were vague and drowsy. He was glad that he was alive, glad
to be back once more among familiar scenes. Down the length of the
train he saw white passengers from the Pullmans restlessly pacing
up and down, getting into their cars and out of them, consulting
watches, attaching themselves with gesticulatory expostulation
to various officials; but their impatience found no echo in his
thought. What was the hurry? There was plenty of time. It was
sufficient to have come to his own land; the actual walls of home
could wait. The delay was pleasant, with its opportunity for drowsy
sunning, its relief from the grimy monotony of travel. He glanced
at the orange-colored “Jim Crow” with distaste, and inspiration,
dawning slowly upon him, swept all other thought before it in its
great and growing glory.

A brakeman passed, and Gideon leaped to his feet and pursued him.

“Misteh, how long yo’-all reckon this train goin’ to be?”

“About an hour.”

The question had been a mere matter of form. Gideon had made up his
mind, and if he had been told that they started in five minutes he
would not have changed it. He climbed back into the car for his
coat and his hat, and then almost furtively stole down the steps
again and slipped quietly into the palmetto scrub.

“’Most made the mistake of ma life,” he chuckled, “stickin’ to that
ol’ train foheveh. ’Tisn’t the right way at, all foh Gideon to come
home.”

The river was not far away. He could catch the dancing blue of it
from time to time in ragged vista, and for this beacon he steered
directly. His coat was heavy on his arm, his thin patent-leather
ties pinched and burned and demanded detours around swampy places,
but he was happy.

As he went along, his plan perfected itself. He would get into
loose shoes again, old ones, if money could buy them, and old
clothes, too. The bull-briers snatching at his tailored splendor
suggested that.

He laughed when the Florida partridge, a small quail, whirred up
from under his feet; he paused to exchange affectionate mockery
with red squirrels; and once, even when he was brought up suddenly
to a familiar and ominous, dry reverberation, the small, crisp
sound of the rolling drums of death, he did not look about him for
some instrument of destruction, as at any other time he would have
done, but instead peered cautiously over the log before him, and
spoke in tolerant admonition:

“Now, Misteh Rattlesnake, yo’ jes min’ yo’ own business. Nobody’s
goin’ step on yo’, ner go triflin’ roun’ yo’ in no way whatsomeveh.
Yo’ jes lay there in the sun an’ git ’s fat ’s yo’ please. Don’ yo’
tu’n yo’ weeked li’l’ eyes on Gideon. He’s jes goin’ ’long home,
an’ ain’ lookin’ foh no muss.”

He came presently to the water, and, as luck would have it, to a
little group of negro cabins, where he was able to buy old clothes
and, after much dickering, a long and somewhat leaky rowboat rigged
out with a tattered leg-of-mutton sail. This he provisioned with
a jug of water, a starch box full of white corn-meal, and a wide
strip of lean razorback bacon.

As he pushed out from shore and set his sail to the small breeze
that blew down from the north, an absolute contentment possessed
him. The idle waters of the lagoon, lying without tide or current
in eternal indolence, rippled and sparkled in breeze and sunlight
with a merry surface activity, and seemed to lap the leaky little
boat more swiftly on its way. Mosquito Inlet opened broadly before
him, and skirting the end of Merritt’s Island he came at last into
that longest lagoon, with which he was most familiar, the Indian
River. Here the wind died down to a mere breath, which barely kept
his boat in motion; but he made no attempt to row. As long as he
moved at all, he was satisfied. He was living the fulfilment of his
dreams in exile, lounging in the stern in the ancient clothes he
had purchased, his feet stretched comfortably before him in their
broken shoes, one foot upon a thwart, the other hanging overside
so laxly that occasional ripples lapped the run-over heel. From
time to time he scanned shore and river for familiar points of
interest—some remembered snag that showed the tip of one gnarled
branch. Or he marked a newly fallen palmetto, already rotting in
the water, which must be added to that map of vast detail that
he carried in his head. But for the most part his broad black
face was turned up to the blue brilliance above him in unblinking
contemplation; his keen eyes, brilliant despite their sun-muddied
whites, reveled in the heights above him, swinging from horizon to
horizon in the wake of an orderly file of little bluebill ducks,
winging their way across the river, or brightening with interest at
the rarer sight of a pair of mallards or redheads, lifting with the
soaring circles of the great bald-headed eagle, or following the
scattered squadron of heron—white heron, blue heron, young and old,
trailing, sunlit, brilliant patches, clear even against the bright
white and blue of the sky above them.

Often he laughed aloud, sending a great shout of mirth across
the water in fresh relish of those comedies best known and best
enjoyed. It was as excruciatingly funny as it had ever been, when
his boat nosed its way into a great flock of ducks idling upon the
water, to see the mad paddling haste of those nearest him, the
reproachful turn of their heads, or, if he came too near, their
spattering run out of water, feet and wings pumping together as
they rose from the surface, looking for all the world like fat
little women, scurrying with clutched skirts across city streets.
The pelicans, too, delighted him as they perched with pedantic
solemnity upon wharf-piles, or sailed in hunched and huddled
gravity twenty feet above the river’s surface in swift, dignified
flight, which always ended suddenly in an abrupt, up-ended plunge
that threw dignity to the winds in its greedy haste, and dropped
them crashing into the water.

When darkness came suddenly at last, he made in toward shore,
mooring to the warm-fretted end of a fallen and forgotten landing.
A straggling orange-grove was here, broken lines of vanquished
cultivation, struggling little trees swathed and choked in the
festooning gray moss, still showing here and there the valiant
golden gleam of fruit. Gideon had seen many such places, had
seen settlers come and clear themselves a space in the jungle,
plant their groves, and live for a while in lazy independence;
and then for some reason or other they would go, and before they
had scarcely turned their backs, the jungle had crept in again,
patiently restoring its ancient sovereignty. The place was eery
with the ghost of dead effort; but it pleased him.

He made a fire and cooked supper, eating enormously and with
relish. His conscience did not trouble him at all. Stuhk and
his own career seemed already distant; they took small place in
his thoughts, and served merely as a background for his present
absolute content. He picked some oranges, and ate them in
meditative enjoyment. For a while he nodded, half asleep, beside
his fire, watching the darkened river, where the mullet, shimmering
with phosphorescence, still leaped starkly above the surface, and
fell in spattering brilliance. Midnight found him sprawled asleep
beside his fire.

Once he awoke. The moon had risen, and a little breeze waved the
hanging moss, and whispered in the glossy foliage of orange and
palmetto with a sound like falling rain. Gideon sat up and peered
about him, rolling his eyes hither and thither at the menacing
leap and dance of the jet shadows. His heart was beating thickly,
his muscles twitched, and the awful terrors of night pulsed and
shuddered over him. Nameless specters peered at him from every
shadow, ingenerate familiars of his wild, forgotten blood. He
groaned aloud in a delicious terror; and presently, still twitching
and shivering, fell asleep again. It was as if something magical
had happened; his fear remembered the fear of centuries, and yet
with the warm daylight was absolutely forgotten.

He got up a little after sunrise, and went down to the river to
bathe, diving deep with a joyful sense of freeing himself from the
last alien dust of travel. Once ashore again, however, he began to
prepare his breakfast with some haste. For the first time in his
journey he was feeling a sense of loneliness and a longing for his
kind. He was still happy, but his laughter began to seem strange to
him in the solitude. He tried the defiant experiment of laughing
for the effect of it, an experiment which brought him to his feet
in startled terror; for his laughter was echoed. As he stood
peering about him, the sound came again, not laughter this time,
but a suppressed giggle. It was human beyond a doubt. Gideon’s face
shone with relief and sympathetic amusement; he listened for a
moment, and then strode surely forward toward a clump of low palms.
There he paused, every sense alert. His ear caught a soft rustle, a
little gasp of fear; the sound of a foot moved cautiously.

“Missy,” he said tentatively, “I reckon yo’-all’s come jes ’bout ’n
time foh breakfus. Yo’ betteh have some. Ef yo’ ain’ too white to
sit down with a black man.”

The leaves parted, and a smiling face as black as Gideon’s own
regarded him in shy amusement.

“Who is yo’, man?”

“I mought be king of Kongo,” he laughed, “but I ain’t. Yo’
see befo’ yo’ jes Gideon—at yo’r ’steemed sehvice.” He bowed
elaborately in the mock humility of assured importance, watching
her face in pleasant anticipation.

But neither awe nor rapture dawned there. She repeated the name,
inclining her head coquettishly; but it evidently meant nothing to
her. She was merely trying its sound. “Gideon, Gideon. I don’ call
to min’ any sech name ez that. Yo’-all’s f’om up No’th likely.” He
was beyond the reaches of fame.

“No,” said Gideon, hardly knowing whether he was glad or sorry—“no,
I live south of heah. What-all’s yo’ name?”

The girl giggled deliciously.

“Man,” she said, “I shu got the mos’ reediculoustest name you eveh
did heah. They call me Vashti—yo’ bacon’s bu’nin’.” She stepped
out, and ran past him to snatch his skillet deftly from the fire.

“Vashti”—a strange and delightful name. Gideon followed her slowly.
Her romantic coming and her romantic name pleased him; and, too,
he thought her beautiful. She was scarcely more than a girl, slim
and strong and almost of his own height. She was barefooted, but
her blue-checked gingham was clean and belted smartly about a small
waist. He remembered only one woman who ran as lithely as she did,
one of the numerous “diving beauties” of the vaudeville stage.

She cooked their breakfast, but he served her with an elaborate
gallantry, putting forward all his new and foreign graces,
garnishing his speech with imposing polysyllables, casting about
their picnic breakfast a radiant aura of grandeur borrowed from
the recent days of his fame. And he saw that he pleased her, and
with her open admiration essayed still greater flights of polished
manner.

He made vague plans for delaying his journey as they sat smoking
in pleasant conversational ease; and when an interruption came it
vexed him.

“Vashty! Vashty!” a woman’s voice sounded thin and far away.
“Vashty-y! Yo’ heah me, chile?”

Vashti rose to her feet with a sigh.

“That’s my ma,” she said regretfully.

“What do yo’ care?” asked Gideon. “Let her yell awhile.”

The girl shook her head.

“Ma’s a moughty pow’ful ’oman, and she done got a club ’bout the
size o’ my wrist.” She moved off a step or so, and glanced back at
him.

Gideon leaped to his feet.

“When yo’ comin’ back? Yo’—yo’ ain’ goin’ without——” He held out
his arms to her, but she only giggled and began to walk slowly
away. With a bound he was after her, one hand catching her lightly
by the shoulder. He felt suddenly that he must not lose sight of
her.

“Let me go! Tu’n me loose, yo’!” The girl was still laughing, but
evidently troubled. She wrenched herself away with an effort, only
to be caught again a moment later. She screamed and struck at him
as he kissed her; for now she was really in terror.

The blow caught Gideon squarely in the mouth, and with such force
that he staggered back, astonished, while the girl took wildly to
her heels. He stood for a moment irresolute, for something was
happening to him. For months he had evaded love with a gentle
embarrassment; now, with the savage crash of that blow, he knew
unreasoningly that he had found his woman.

He leaped after her again, running as he had not run in years,
in savage, determined pursuit, tearing through brier and scrub,
tripping, falling, rising, never losing sight of the blue-clad
figure before him until at last she tripped and fell, and he stood
panting above her.

He took a great breath or so, and leaned over and picked her up
in his arms, where she screamed and struck and scratched at him.
He laughed, for he felt no longer sensible to pain, and, still
chuckling, picked his way carefully back to the shore, wading deep
into the water to unmoor his boat. Then with a swift movement he
dropped the girl into the bow, pushed free, and clambered actively
aboard.

The light, early morning breeze had freshened, and he made out
well toward the middle of the river, never even glancing around at
the sound of the hallooing he now heard from shore. His exertions
had quickened his breathing, but he felt strong and joyful. Vashti
lay a huddle of blue in the bow, crouched in fear and desolation,
shaken and torn with sobbing; but he made no effort to comfort
her. He was untroubled by any sense of wrong; he was simply and
unreasoningly satisfied with what he had done. Despite all his
gentle, easy-going, laughter-loving existence, he found nothing
incongruous or unnatural in this sudden act of violence. He was
aglow with happiness; he was taking home a wife. The blind tumult
of capture had passed; a great tenderness possessed him.

The leaky little boat was plunging and dancing in swift ecstasy
of movement; all about them the little waves ran glittering in
the sunlight, plashing and slapping against the boat’s low side,
tossing tiny crests to the following wind, showing rifts of white
here and there, blowing handfuls of foam and spray. Gideon went
softly about the business of shortening his small sail, and came
quietly back to his steering-seat again. Soon he would have to be
making for what lea the western shore offered; but he was holding
to the middle of the river as long as he could, because with every
mile the shores were growing more familiar, calling to him to make
what speed he could. Vashti’s sobbing had grown small and ceased;
he wondered if she had fallen asleep.

Presently, however, he saw her face raised—a face still shining
with tears. She saw that he was watching her, and crouched low
again. A dash of spray spattered over her, and she looked up
frightened, glancing fearfully overside; then once more her eyes
came back to him, and this time she got up, still small and
crouching, and made her way slowly and painfully down the length of
the boat, until at last Gideon moved aside for her, and she sank in
the bottom beside him, hiding her eyes in her gingham sleeve.

Gideon stretched out a broad hand and touched her head lightly; and
with a tiny gasp her fingers stole up to his.

“Honey,” said Gideon—“Honey, yo’ ain’ mad, is yo’?”

She shook her head, not looking at him.

“Yo’ ain’ grievin’ foh yo’ ma?”

Again she shook her head.

“Because,” said Gideon, smiling down at her, “I ain’ got no beeg
club like she has.”

A soft and smothered giggle answered him, and this time Vashti
looked up and laid her head against him with a small sigh of
contentment.

Gideon felt very tender, very important, at peace with himself and
all the world. He rounded a jutting point, and stretched out a
black hand, pointing.

A SHORT HISTORY OF THE WORLD



I
THE WORLD IN SPACE


The story of our world is a story that is still very imperfectly known.
A couple of hundred years ago men possessed the history of little more
than the last three thousand years. What happened before that time was
a matter of legend and speculation.  Over a large part of the civilized
world it was believed and taught that the world had been created
suddenly in 4004 B.C., though authorities differed as to whether this
had occurred in the spring or autumn of that year. This fantastically
precise misconception was based upon a too literal interpretation of
the Hebrew Bible, and upon rather arbitrary theological assumptions
connected therewith.  Such ideas have long since been abandoned by
religious teachers, and it is universally recognized that the universe
in which we live has to all appearances existed for an enormous period
of time and possibly for endless time.  Of course there may be
deception in these appearances, as a room may be made to seem endless
by putting mirrors facing each other at either end. But that the
universe in which we live has existed only for six or seven thousand
years may be regarded as an altogether exploded idea.

The earth, as everybody knows nowadays, is a spheroid, a sphere
slightly compressed, orange fashion, with a diameter of nearly 8,000
miles.  Its spherical shape has been known at least to a limited number
of intelligent people for nearly 2,500 years, but before that time it
was supposed to be flat, and various ideas which now seem fantastic
were entertained about its relations to the sky and the stars and
planets.  We know now that it rotates upon its axis (which is about 24
miles shorter than its equatorial diameter) every twenty-four hours,
and that this is the cause of the alternations of day and night, that
it circles about the sun in a slightly distorted and slowly variable
oval path in a year. Its distance from the sun varies between
ninety-one and a half millions at its nearest and ninety-four and a
half million miles.

About the earth circles a smaller sphere, the moon, at an average
distance  of 239,000 miles. Earth and moon are not the only bodies to
travel round  the sun.  There are also the planets, Mercury and Venus,
at distances of  thirty-six and sixty-seven millions of miles; and
beyond the circle of the  earth and disregarding a belt of numerous
smaller bodies, the planetoids,  there are Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,
Uranus and Neptune at mean distances of 141, 483, 886, 1,782, and 1,793
millions of miles respectively. These figures in millions of miles are
very difficult for the mind to grasp.  It may help the reader’s
imagination if we reduce the sun and planets to a smaller, more
conceivable scale.

If, then, we represent our earth as a little ball of one inch diameter,
 the sun would be a big globe nine feet across and 323 yards away, that
 is about a fifth of a mile, four or five minutes’ walking.  The  moon
would be a small pea two feet and a half from the world.  Between earth
and sun there would be the two inner planets, Mercury and Venus,  at
distances of one hundred and twenty-five and two hundred and fifty 
yards from the sun. All round and about these bodies there would be 
emptiness until you came to Mars, a hundred and seventy-five feet
beyond the earth; Jupiter nearly a mile away, a foot in diameter;
Saturn, a little smaller, two miles off; Uranus four miles off and
Neptune six miles off. Then nothingness and nothingness except for
small particles and drifting scraps of attenuated vapour for thousands
of miles.  The nearest star to earth on this scale would be 40,000
miles away.

These figures will serve perhaps to give one some conception of the
immense emptiness of space in which the drama of life goes on.

For in all this enormous vacancy of space we know certainly of life
only  upon the surface of our earth. It does not penetrate much more
than three miles down into the 4,000 miles that separate us from the
centre of our globe, and it does not reach more than five miles above
its surface.  Apparently all the limitlessness of space is otherwise
empty and dead.

The deepest ocean dredgings go down to five miles. The highest recorded
flight of an aeroplane is little more than four miles. Men have reached
to seven miles up in balloons, but at a cost of great suffering.  No
bird can fly so high as five miles, and small birds and insects which
have been carried up by aeroplanes drop off insensible far below that
level.




II
THE WORLD IN TIME


In the last fifty years there has been much very fine and interesting
speculation on the part of scientific men upon the age and origin of
our earth. Here we cannot pretend to give even a summary of such
speculations because they involve the most subtle mathematical and
physical considerations. The truth is that the physical and
astronomical sciences are still too undeveloped as yet to make anything
of the sort more than an illustrative guesswork. The general tendency
has been to make the estimated age of our globe longer and longer. It
now seems probable that the earth has had an independent existence as a
spinning planet flying round and round the sun for a longer period than
2,000,000,000 years. It may have been much longer than that. This is a
length of time that absolutely overpowers the imagination.

Before that vast period of separate existence, the sun and earth and
the other planets that circulate round the sun may have been a great
swirl of diffused matter in space.  The telescope reveals to us in
various parts of the heavens luminous spiral clouds of matter, the
spiral nebulæ, which appear to be in rotation about a centre. It is
supposed by many astronomers that the sun and its planets were once
such a spiral, and that their matter has undergone concentration into
its present form. Through majestic æons that concentration went on
until in that vast remoteness of the past for which we have given
figures, the world and its moon were distinguishable.  They were
spinning then much faster than they are spinning now; they were at a
lesser distance from the sun; they travelled round it very much faster,
and they were probably incandescent or molten at the surface.  The sun
itself was a much greater blaze in the heavens.

If we could go back through that infinitude of time and see the earth
in this earlier stage of its history, we should behold a scene more
like the interior of a blast furnace or the surface of a lava flow
before it cools and cakes over than any other contemporary scene.  No
water would be visible because all the water there was would still be
superheated steam in a stormy atmosphere of sulphurous and metallic
vapours.  Beneath this would swirl and boil an ocean of molten rock
substance.  Across a sky of fiery clouds the glare of the hurrying sun
and moon would sweep swiftly like hot breaths of flame.

There are dark nebulæ and bright nebulæ.  Prof. Henry Norris Russell,
against the British theory, holds that the dark nebulæ preceded the
bright nebulæ.

Slowly by degrees as one million of years followed another, this fiery
scene would lose its eruptive incandescence.  The vapours in the sky
would rain down and become less dense overhead; great slaggy cakes of
solidifying rock would appear upon the surface of the molten sea, and
sink under it, to be replaced by other floating masses.  The sun and
moon growing now each more distant and each smaller, would rush with
diminishing swiftness across the heavens. The moon now, because of its
smaller size, would be already cooled far below incandescence, and
would be alternately obstructing and reflecting the sunlight in a
series of eclipses and full moons.

And so with a tremendous slowness through the vastness of time, the
earth would grow more and more like the earth on which we live, until
at last an age would come when, in the cooling air, steam would begin
to condense into clouds, and the first rain would fall hissing upon the
first rocks below.  For endless millenia the greater part of the
earth’s water would still be vaporized in the atmosphere, but there
would now be hot streams running over the crystallizing rocks below and
pools and lakes into which these streams would be carrying detritus and
depositing sediment.


LANDSCAPE BEFORE LIFE
LANDSCAPE BEFORE LIFE
“Great lava-like masses of rock without traces of soil”


At last a condition of things must have been attained in which a man
might have stood up on earth and looked about him and lived. If we
could have visited the earth at that time we should have stood on great
lava-like masses of rock without a trace of soil or touch of living
vegetation, under a storm-rent sky.  Hot and violent winds, exceeding
the fiercest tornado that ever blows, and downpours of rain such as our
milder, slower earth to-day knows nothing of, might have assailed us. 
The water of the downpour would have rushed by us, muddy with the
spoils of the rocks, coming together into torrents, cutting deep gorges
and canyons as they hurried past to deposit their sediment in the
earliest seas.  Through the clouds we should have glimpsed a great sun
moving visibly across the sky, and in its wake and in the wake of the
moon would have come a diurnal tide of earthquake and upheaval. And

the moon, which nowadays keeps one constant face to earth, would then
have been rotating visibly and showing the side it now hides so
inexorably.

The earth aged.  One million years followed another, and the day
lengthened, the sun grew more distant and milder, the moon’s pace in
the sky slackened; the intensity of rain and storm diminished and the
water in the first seas increased and ran together into the ocean
garment our planet henceforth wore.

But there was no life as yet upon the earth; the seas were lifeless,
and the rocks were barren.




III
THE BEGINNINGS OF LIFE


As everybody knows nowadays, the knowledge we possess of life before
the beginnings of human memory and tradition is derived from the
markings and fossils of living things in the stratified rocks. We find
preserved in shale and slate, limestone, and sandstone, bones, shells,
fibres, stems, fruits, footmarks, scratchings and the like, side by
side with the ripple marks of the earliest tides and the pittings of
the earliest rain-falls. It is by the sedulous examination of this
Record of the Rocks that the past history of the earth’s life has been
pieced together.  That much nearly everybody knows to-day.  The
sedimentary rocks do not lie neatly stratum above stratum; they have
been crumpled, bent, thrust about, distorted and mixed together like
the leaves of a library that has been repeatedly looted and burnt, and
it is only as a result of many devoted lifetimes of work that the
record has been put into order and read.  The whole compass of time
represented by the record of the rocks is now estimated as
1,600,000,000 years.

The earliest rocks in the record are called by geologists the Azoic
rocks, because they show no traces of life.  Great areas of these Azoic
rocks lie uncovered in North America, and they are of such a thickness
that geologists consider that they represent a period of at least half
of the 1,600,000,000 which they assign to the whole geological record. 
Let me repeat this profoundly significant fact. Half the great interval
of time since land and sea were first distinguishable on earth has left
us no traces of life.  There are ripplings and rain marks still to be
found in these rocks, but no marks nor vestiges of any living thing.

MARINE LIFE IN THE CAMBRIAN PERIOD

Trilobite (Paradoxides) — see fossil on page 13; 9, Coral
(Archæocyathus);  10, Bryograptus;  11, Trilobite (Olenellus); 12,
Palesterina


Then, as we come up the record, signs of past life appear and increase.
 The age of the world’s history in which we find these past traces is
called by geologists the Lower Palæozoic age. The first indications
that life was astir are vestiges of comparatively simple and lowly
things: the shells of small shellfish, the stems and flowerlike heads
of zoophytes, seaweeds and the tracks and remains of sea worms and
crustacea.  Very early appear certain creatures rather like plant-lice,
crawling creatures which could roll themselves up into balls as the
plant-lice do, the trilobites.  Later by a few million years or so come
certain sea scorpions, more mobile and powerful creatures than the
world had ever seen before.

None of these creatures were of very great size.  Among the largest
were certain of the sea scorpions, which measured nine feet in length. 
There are no signs whatever of land life of any sort, plant or animal;
there are no fishes nor any vertebrated creatures in this part of the
record.  Essentially all the plants and creatures which have left us
their traces from this period of the earth’s history are shallow-water
and intertidal beings.  If we wished to parallel the flora and fauna of
the Lower Palæozoic rocks on the earth to-day, we should do it best,
except in the matter of size, by taking a drop of water from a rock
pool or scummy ditch and examining it under a microscope.  The little
crustacea, the small shellfish, the zoophytes and algæ we should find
there would display a quite striking resemblance to these clumsier,
larger prototypes that once were the crown of life upon our planet.

It is well, however, to bear in mind that the Lower Palæozoic rocks
probably do not give us anything at all representative of the first
beginnings of life on our planet. Unless a creature has bones or other
hard parts, unless it wears a shell or is big enough and heavy enough
to make characteristic footprints and trails in mud, it is unlikely to
leave any fossilized traces of its existence behind.  To-day there are
hundreds of thousands of species of small soft-bodied creatures in our
world which it is inconceivable can ever leave any mark for future
geologists to discover.  In the world’s past, millions of millions of
species of such creatures may have lived and multiplied and flourished
and passed away without a trace remaining.  The waters of the warm and
shallow lakes and seas of the so-called Azoic period may have teemed
with an infinite variety of lowly, jelly-like, shell-less and boneless
creatures, and a multitude of green scummy plants may have spread over
the sunlit intertidal rocks and beaches.  The Record of the Rocks is no
more a complete record of life in the past than the books of a bank are
a record of the existence of everybody in the neighbourhood.  It is
only when a species begins to secrete a shell or a spicule or a
carapace or a lime-supported stem, and so put by something for the
future, that it goes upon the Record.  But in rocks of an age prior to
those which bear any fossil traces, graphite, a form of uncombined
carbon, is sometimes found, and some authorities consider that it may
have been separated out from combination through the vital activities
of unknown living things.

IV
THE AGE OF FISHES


In the days when the world was supposed to have endured for only a few
thousand years, it was supposed that the different species of plants
and animals were fixed and final; they had all been created exactly as
they are to-day, each species by itself.  But as men began to discover
and study the Record of the Rocks this belief gave place to the
suspicion that many species had changed and developed slowly through
the course of ages, and this again expanded into a belief in what is
called Organic Evolution, a belief that all species of life upon earth,
animal and vegetable alike, are descended by slow continuous processes
of change from some very simple ancestral form of life, some almost
structureless living substance, far back in the so-called Azoic seas.

This question of Organic Evolution, like the question of the age of the
earth, has in the past been the subject of much bitter controversy. 
There was a time when a belief in organic evolution was for rather
obscure reasons supposed to be incompatible with sound Christian,
Jewish and Moslem doctrine.  That time has passed, and the men of the
most orthodox Catholic, Protestant, Jewish and Mohammedan belief are
now free to accept this newer and broader view of a common origin of
all living things.  No life seems to have happened suddenly upon earth.
 Life grew and grows.  Age by age through gulfs of time at which
imagination reels, life has been growing from a mere stirring in the
intertidal slime towards freedom, power and consciousness.

Life consists of individuals. These individuals are definite things,
they are not like the lumps and masses, nor even the limitless and
motionless crystals, of non-living matter, and they have two
characteristics no dead matter possesses.  They can assimilate other
matter into themselves and make it part of themselves, and they can
reproduce themselves.  They eat and they breed.  They can give rise to
other individuals, for the most part like themselves, but always also a
little different from themselves.  There is a specific and family
resemblance between an individual and its offspring, and there is an
individual difference between every parent and every offspring it
produces, and this is true in every species and at every stage of life.

Now scientific men are not able to explain to us either why offspring
should resemble nor why they should differ from their parents.  But
seeing that offspring do at once resemble and differ, it is a matter
rather of common sense than of scientific knowledge that, if the
conditions under which a species live are changed, the species should
undergo some correlated changes.  Because in any generation of the
species there must be a number of individuals whose individual
differences make them better adapted to the new conditions under which
the species has to live, and a number whose individuals whose
individual differences make it rather harder for them to live.  And on
the whole the former sort will live longer, bear more offspring, and
reproduce themselves more abundantly than the latter, and so generation
by generation the average of the species will change in the favourable
direction.  This process, which is called Natural Selection, is not so
much a scientific theory as a necessary deduction from the facts of
reproduction and individual difference.  There may be many forces at
work varying, destroying and preserving species, about which science
may still be unaware or undecided, but the man who can deny the
operation of this process of natural selection upon life since its
beginning must be either ignorant of the elementary facts of life or
incapable of ordinary thought.

Many scientific men have speculated about the first beginning of life
and their speculations are often of great interest, but there is
absolutely no definite knowledge and no convincing guess yet of the way
in which life began.  But nearly all authorities are agreed that it
probably began upon mud or sand in warm sunlit shallow brackish water,
and that it spread up the beaches to the intertidal lines and out to
the open waters.


FOSSIL OF THE CLADOSELACHE, A DEVONIAN SHARK
FOSSIL OF THE CLADOSELACHE, A DEVONIAN SHARK

That early world was a world of strong tides and currents.  An
incessant destruction of individuals must have been going on through
their being swept up the beaches and dried, or by their being swept out
to sea and sinking down out of reach of air and sun.  Early conditions
favoured the development of every tendency to root and hold on, every
tendency to form an outer skin and casing to protect the stranded
individual from immediate desiccation.  From the very earliest any
tendency to sensitiveness to taste would turn the individual in the
direction of food, and any sensitiveness to light would assist it to
struggle back out of the darkness of the sea deeps and caverns or to
wriggle back out of the excessive glare of the dangerous shallows.

Probably the first shells and body armour of living things were
protections against drying rather than against active enemies. But
tooth and claw come early into our earthly history.

We have already noted the size of the earlier water scorpions.  For
long ages such creatures were the supreme lords of life. Then in a
division of these Palæozoic rocks called the Silurian division, which
many geologists now suppose to be as old as five hundred million years,
there appears a new type of being, equipped with eyes and teeth and
swimming powers of an altogether more powerful kind.  These were the
first known backboned animals, the earliest fishes, the first known
Vertebrata.


SHARKS AND GANOIDS OF THE DEVONIAN PERIOD
SHARKS AND GANOIDS OF THE DEVONIAN PERIOD

_By Alice Woodward_


These fishes increase greatly in the next division of rocks, the rocks
known as the Devonian system.  They are so prevalent that this period
of the Record of the Rocks has been called the Age of Fishes.  Fishes
of a pattern now gone from the earth, and fishes allied to the sharks
and sturgeons of to-day, rushed through the waters, leapt in the air,
browsed among the seaweeds, pursued and preyed upon one another, and
gave a new liveliness to the waters of the world. None of these were
excessively big by our present standards.  Few of them were more than
two or three feet long, but there were exceptional forms which were as
long as twenty feet.

We know nothing from geology of the ancestors of these fishes.  They do
not appear to be related to any of the forms that preceded them.
Zoologists have the most interesting views of their ancestry, but these
they derive from the study of the development of the eggs of their
still living relations, and from other sources.  Apparently the
ancestors of the vertebrata were soft-bodied and perhaps quite small
swimming creatures who began first to develop hard parts as teeth round
and about their mouths.  The teeth of a skate or dogfish cover the roof
and floor of its mouth and pass at the lip into the flattened toothlike
scales that encase most of its body. As the fishes develop these teeth
scales in the geological record, they swim out of the hidden darkness
of the past into the light, the first vertebrated animals visible in
the record.




V
THE AGE OF THE COAL SWAMPS


The land during this Age of Fishes was apparently quite lifeless. Crags
and uplands of barren rock lay under the sun and rain. There was no
real soil—for as yet there were no earthworms which help to make a
soil, and no plants to break up the rock particles into mould; there
was no trace of moss or lichen. Life was still only in the sea.

Over this world of barren rock played great changes of climate. The
causes of these changes of climate were very complex and they have
still to be properly estimated.  The changing shape of the earth’s
orbit, the gradual shifting of the poles of rotation, changes in the
shapes of the continents, probably even fluctuations in the warmth of
the sun, now conspired to plunge great areas of the earth’s surface
into long periods of cold and ice and now again for millions of years
spread a warm or equable climate over this planet.  There seem to have
been phases of great internal activity in the world’s history, when in
the course of a few million years accumulated upthrusts would break out
in lines of volcanic eruption and upheaval and rearrange the mountain
and continental outlines of the globe, increasing the depth of the sea
and the height of the mountains and exaggerating the extremes of
climate.  And these would be followed by vast ages of comparative
quiescence, when frost, rain and river would wear down the mountain
heights and carry great masses of silt to fill and raise the sea
bottoms and spread the seas, ever shallower and wider, over more and
more of the land.  There have been “high and deep” ages in the world’s
history and “low and level” ages.  The reader must dismiss from his
mind any idea that the surface of the earth has been growing steadily
cooler since its crust grew solid.  After that much cooling had been
achieved, the internal temperature ceased to affect surface conditions.
There are traces of periods of superabundant ice and snow, of “Glacial
Ages,” that is, even in the Azoic period.

It was only towards the close of the Age of Fishes, in a period of
extensive shallow seas and lagoons, that life spread itself out in any
effectual way from the waters on to the land.  No doubt the earlier
types of the forms that now begin to appear in great abundance had
already been developing in a rare and obscure manner for many scores of
millions of years.  But now came their opportunity.

Plants no doubt preceded animal forms in this invasion of the land, but
the animals probably followed up the plant emigration very closely. The
first problem that the plant had to solve was the problem of some
sustaining stiff support to hold up its fronds to the sunlight when the
buoyant water was withdrawn; the second was the problem of getting
water from the swampy ground below to the tissues of the plant, now
that it was no longer close at hand.  The two problems were solved by
the development of woody tissue which both sustained the plant and
acted as water carrier to the leaves.  The Record of the Rocks is
suddenly crowded by a vast variety of woody swamp plants, many of them
of great size, big tree mosses, tree ferns, gigantic horsetails and the
like.  And with these, age by age, there crawled out of the water a
great variety of animal forms. There were centipedes and millipedes;
there were the first primitive insects; there were creatures related to
the ancient king crabs and sea scorpions which became the earliest
spiders and land scorpions, and presently there were vertebrated
animals.

Some of the earlier insects were very large. There were dragon flies in
this period with wings that spread out to twenty-nine inches.

In various ways these new orders and genera had adapted themselves to
breathing air.  Hitherto all animals had breathed air dissolved in
water, and that indeed is what all animals still have to do. But now in
divers fashions the animal kingdom was acquiring the power of supplying
its own moisture where it was needed.  A man with a perfectly dry lung
would suffocate to-day; his lung surfaces must be moist in order that
air may pass through them into his blood.  The adaptation to air
breathing consists in all cases either in the development of a cover to
the old-fashioned gills to stop evaporation, or in the development of
tubes or other new breathing organs lying deep inside the body and
moistened by a watery secretion.  The old gills with which the
ancestral fish of the vertebrated line had breathed were inadaptable to
breathing upon land, and in the case of this division of the animal
kingdom it is the swimming bladder of the fish which becomes a new,
deep-seated breathing organ, the lung.  The kind of animals known as
amphibia, the frogs and newts of to-day, begin their lives in the water
and breathe by gills; and subsequently the lung, developing in the same
way as the swimming bladder of many fishes do, as a baglike outgrowth
from the throat, takes over the business of breathing, the animal comes
out on land, and the gills dwindle and the gill slits disappear.  (All
except an outgrowth of one gill slit, which becomes the passage of the
ear and ear-drum.)  The animal can now live only in the air, but it
must return at least to the edge of the water to lay its eggs and
reproduce its kind.

All the air-breathing vertebrata of this age of swamps and plants
belonged to the class amphibia.  They were nearly all of them forms
related to the newts of to-day, and some of them attained a
considerable size.  They were land animals, it is true, but they were
land animals needing to live in and near moist and swampy places, and
all the great trees of this period were equally amphibious in their
habits.  None of them had yet developed fruits and seeds of a kind that
could fall on land and develop with the help only of such moisture as
dew and rain could bring.  They all had to shed their spores in water,
it would seem, if they were to germinate.

It is one of the most beautiful interests of that beautiful science,
comparative anatomy, to trace the complex and wonderful adaptations of
living things to the necessities of existence in air.  All living
things, plants and animals alike, are primarily water things.  For
example all the higher vertebrated animals above the fishes, up to and
including man, pass through a stage in their development in the egg or
before birth in which they have gill slits which are obliterated before
the young emerge.  The bare, water-washed eye of the fish is protected
in the higher forms from drying up by eyelids and glands which secrete
moisture.  The weaker sound vibrations of air necessitate an ear-drum. 
In nearly every organ of the body similar modifications and adaptations
are to be detected, similar patchings-up to meet aerial conditions.

This Carboniferous age, this age of the amphibia, was an age of life in
the swamps and lagoons and on the low banks among these waters. Thus
far life had now extended.  The hills and high lands were still quite
barren and lifeless.  Life had learnt to breathe air indeed, but it
still had its roots in its native water; it still had to return to the
water to reproduce its kind.




VI
THE AGE OF REPTILES


The abundant life of the Carboniferous period was succeeded by a vast
cycle of dry and bitter ages.  They are represented in the Record of
the Rocks by thick deposits of sandstones and the like, in which
fossils are comparatively few. The temperature of the world fluctuated
widely, and there were long periods of glacial cold. Over great areas
the former profusion of swamp vegetation ceased, and, overlaid by these
newer deposits, it began that process of compression and mineralization
that gave the world most of the coal deposits of to-day.

But it is during periods of change that life undergoes its most rapid
modifications, and under hardship that it learns its hardest lessons. 
As conditions revert towards warmth and moisture again we find a new
series of animal and plant forms established,  We find in the record
the remains of vertebrated animals that laid eggs which, instead of
hatching out tadpoles which needed to live for a time in water, carried
on their development before hatching to a stage so nearly like the
adult form that the young could live in air from the first moment of
independent existence.  Gills had been cut out altogether, and the gill
slits only appeared as an embryonic phase.

These new creatures without a tadpole stage were the Reptiles.
Concurrently there had been a development of seed-bearing trees, which
could spread their seed, independently of swamp or lakes. There were
now palmlike cycads and many tropical conifers, though as yet there
were no flowering plants and no grasses.  There was a great number of
ferns.  And there was now also an increased variety of insects.  There
were beetles, though bees and butterflies had yet to come.  But all the
fundamental forms of a new real land fauna and flora had been laid down
during these vast ages of severity.  This new land life needed only the
opportunity of favourable conditions to flourish and prevail.

Age by age and with abundant fluctuations that mitigation came.  The
still incalculable movements of the earth’s crust, the changes in its
orbit, the increase and diminution of the mutual inclination of orbit
and pole, worked together to produce a great spell of widely diffused
warm conditions.  The period lasted altogether, it is now supposed,
upwards of two hundred million years.  It is called the Mesozoic
period, to distinguish it from the altogether vaster Palæozoic and
Azoic periods (together fourteen hundred millions) that preceded it,
and from the Cainozoic or new life period that intervened between its
close and the present time, and it is also called the Age of Reptiles
because of the astonishing predominance and variety of this form of
life.  It came to an end some eighty million  years ago.

In the world to-day the genera of Reptiles are comparatively few and
their distribution is very limited.  They are more various, it is true,
than are the few surviving members of the order of the amphibia which
once in the Carboniferous period ruled the world.  We still have the
snakes, the turtles and tortoises (the Chelonia), the alligators and
crocodiles, and the lizards.  Without exception they are creatures
requiring warmth all the year round; they cannot stand exposure to
cold, and it is probable that all the reptilian beings of the Mesozoic
suffered under the same limitation.  It was a hothouse fauna, living
amidst a hothouse flora.  It endured no frosts.  But the world had at
least attained a real dry land fauna and flora as distinguished from
the mud and swamp fauna and flora of the previous heyday of life upon
earth.

All the sorts of reptile we know now were much more abundantly
represented then, great turtles and tortoises, big crocodiles and many
lizards and snakes, but in addition there was a number of series of
wonderful creatures that have now vanished altogether from the earth. 
There was a vast variety of beings called the Dinosaurs. Vegetation was
now spreading over the lower levels of the world, reeds, brakes of fern
and the like; and browsing upon this abundance came a multitude of
herbivorous reptiles, which increased in size as the Mesozoic period
rose to its climax.  Some of these beasts exceeded in size any other
land animals that have ever lived; they were as large as whales.  The
_Diplodocus Carnegii_ for example measured eighty-four feet from snout
to tail; the Gigantosaurus was even greater; it measured a hundred
feet.  Living upon these monsters was a swarm of carnivorous Dinosaurs
of a corresponding size.  One of these, the Tyrannosaurus, is figured
and described in many books as the last word in reptilian
frightfulness.

While these great creatures pastured and pursued amidst the fronds and
evergreens of the Mesozoic jungles, another now vanished tribe of
reptiles, with a bat-like development of the fore limbs, pursued
insects and one another, first leapt and parachuted and presently flew
amidst the fronds and branches of the forest trees.  These were the
Pterodactyls. These were the first flying creatures with backbones;
they mark a new achievement in the growing powers of vertebrated life.

Moreover some of the reptiles were returning to the sea waters. Three
groups of big swimming beings had invaded the sea from which their
ancestors had come: the Mososaurs, the Plesiosaurs, and Ichthyosaurs. 
Some of these again approached the proportions of our present whales. 
The Ichthyosaurs seem to have been quite seagoing creatures, but the
Plesiosaurs were a type of animal that has no cognate form to-day.  The
body was stout and big with paddles, adapted either for swimming or
crawling through marshes, or along the bottom of shallow waters.  The
comparatively small head was poised on a vast snake of neck, altogether
outdoing the neck of the swan. Either the Plesiosaur swam and searched
for food under the water and fed as the swan will do, or it lurked
under water and snatched at passing fish or beast.

Such was the predominant land life throughout the Mesozoic age.  It was
by our human standards an advance upon anything that had preceded it. 
It had produced land animals greater in size, range, power and
activity, more “vital” as people say, than anything the world had seen
before.  In the seas there had been no such advance but a great
proliferation of new forms of life.  An enormous variety of squid-like
creatures with chambered shells, for the most part coiled, had appeared
in the shallow seas, the Ammonites.  They had had predecessors in the
Palæozoic seas, but now was their age of glory.  To-day they have left
no survivors at all; their nearest relation is the pearly Nautilus, an
inhabitant of tropical waters.  And a new and more prolific type of
fish with lighter, finer scales than the plate-like and tooth-like
coverings that had hitherto prevailed, became and has since remained
predominant in the seas and rivers.




VII
THE FIRST BIRDS AND THE FIRST MAMMALS


In a few paragraphs a picture of the lush vegetation and swarming
reptiles of that first great summer of life, the Mesozoic period, has
been sketched.  But while the Dinosaurs lorded it over the hot selvas
and marshy plains and the Pterodactyls filled the forests with their
flutterings and possibly with shrieks and croakings as they pursued the
humming insect life of the still flowerless shrubs and trees, some less
conspicuous and less abundant forms upon the margins of this abounding
life were acquiring certain powers and learning certain lessons of
endurance, that were to be of the utmost value to their race when at
last the smiling generosity of sun and earth began to fade.

A group of tribes and genera of hopping reptiles, small creatures of
the dinosaur type, seem to have been pushed by competition and the
pursuit of their enemies towards the alternatives of extinction or
adaptation to colder conditions in the higher hills or by the sea.
Among these distressed tribes there was developed a new type of
scale—scales that were elongated into quill-like forms and that
presently branched into the crude beginnings of feathers. These
quill-like scales layover one another and formed a heat-retaining
covering more efficient than any reptilian covering that had hitherto
existed.  So they permitted an invasion of colder regions that were
otherwise uninhabited.  Perhaps simultaneously with these changes there
arose in these creatures a greater solicitude for their eggs.  Most
reptiles are apparently quite careless about their eggs, which are left
for sun and season to hatch.  But some of the varieties upon this new
branch of the tree of life were acquiring a habit of guarding their
eggs and keeping them warm with the warmth of their bodies.

With these adaptations to cold other internal modifications were going
on that made these creatures, the primitive birds, warm-blooded and
independent of basking.  The very earliest birds seem to have been
seabirds living upon fish, and their fore limbs were not wings but
paddles rather after the penguin type.  That peculiarly primitive bird,
the New Zealand Ki-Wi, has feathers of a very simple sort, and neither
flies nor appears to be descended from flying ancestors.  In the
development of the birds, feathers came before wings.  But once the
feather was developed the possibility of making a light spread of
feathers led inevitably to the wing.  We know of the fossil remains of
one bird at least which had reptilian teeth in its jaw and a long
reptilian tail, but which also had a true bird’s wing and which
certainly flew and held its own among the pterodactyls of the Mesozoic
time.  Nevertheless birds were neither varied nor abundant in Mesozoic
times.  If a man could go back to typical Mesozoic country, he might
walk for days and never see or hear such a thing as a bird, though he
would see a great abundance of pterodactyls and insects among the
fronds and reeds.

And another thing he would probably never see, and that would be any
sign of a mammal.  Probably the first mammals were in existence
millions of years before the first thing one could call a bird, but
they were altogether too small and obscure and remote for attention.


HESPERORNIS IN ITS NATIVE SEAS
HESPERORNIS IN ITS NATIVE SEAS


The earliest mammals, like the earliest birds, were creatures driven by
competition and pursuit into a life of hardship and adaptation to cold.
 With them also the scale became quill-like, and was developed into a
heat-retaining covering; and they too underwent modifications, similar
in kind though different in detail, to become warm-blooded and
independent of basking.  Instead of feathers they developed hairs, and
instead of guarding and incubating their eggs they kept them warm and
safe by retaining them inside their bodies until they were almost
mature.  Most of them became altogether vivaparous and brought their
young into the world alive.  And even after their young were born they
tended to maintain a protective and nutritive association with them. 
Most but not all mammals to-day have mammæ and suckle their young.  Two
mammals still live which lay eggs and which have not proper mammæ,
though they nourish their young by a nutritive secretion of the under
skin; these are the duck-billed platypus and the echidna.  The echidna
lays leathery eggs and then puts them into a pouch under its belly, and
so carries them about warm and safe until they hatch.

But just as a visitor to the Mesozoic world might have searched for
days and weeks before finding a bird, so, unless he knew exactly where
to go and look, he might have searched in vain for any traces of a
mammal.  Both birds and mammals would have seemed very eccentric and
secondary and unimportant creatures in Mesozoic times.

The Age of Reptiles lasted, it is now guessed, eighty million years.
Had any quasi-human intelligence been watching the world through that
inconceivable length of time, how safe and eternal the sunshine and
abundance must have seemed, how assured the wallowing prosperity of the
dinosaurs and the flapping abundance of the flying lizards! And then
the mysterious rhythms and accumulating forces of the universe began to
turn against that quasi-eternal stability.  That run of luck for life
was running out.  Age by age, myriad of years after myriad of years,
with halts no doubt and retrogressions, came a change towards hardship
and extreme conditions, came great alterations of level and great
redistributions of mountain and sea.  We find one thing in the Record
of the Rocks during the decadence of the long Mesozoic age of
prosperity that is very significant of steadily sustained changes of
condition, and that is a violent fluctuation of living forms and the
appearance of new and strange species. Under the gathering threat of
extinction the older orders and genera are displaying their utmost
capacity for variation and adaptation.  The Ammonites for example in
these last pages of the Mesozoic chapter exhibit a multitude of
fantastic forms.  Under settled conditions there is no encouragement
for novelties; they do not develop, they are suppressed; what is best
adapted is already there.  Under novel conditions it is the ordinary
type that suffers, and the novelty that may have a better chance to
survive and establish itself....

There comes a break in the Record of the Rocks that may represent
several million years.  There is a veil here still, over even the
outline of the history of life.  When it lifts again, the Age of
Reptiles is at an end; the Dinosaurs, the Plesiosaurs and Ichthyosaurs,
the Pterodactyls, the innumerable genera and species of Ammonite have
all gone absolutely.  In all their stupendous variety they have died
out and left no descendants.  The cold has killed them.  All their
final variations were insufficient; they had never hit upon survival
conditions.  The world had passed through a phase of extreme conditions
beyond their powers of endurance, a slow and complete massacre of
Mesozoic life has occurred, and we find now a new scene, a new and
hardier flora, and a new and hardier fauna in possession of the world.

It is still a bleak and impoverished scene with which this new volume
of the book of life begins. The cycads and tropical conifers have given
place very largely to trees that shed their leaves to avoid destruction
by the snows of winter and to flowering plants and shrubs, and where
there was formerly a profusion of reptiles, an increasing variety of
birds and mammals is entering into their inheritance.




VIII
THE AGE OF MAMMALS


The opening of the next great period in the life of the earth, the
Cainozoic period, was a period of upheaval and extreme volcanic
activity. Now it was that the vast masses of the Alps and Himalayas and
the mountain backbone of the Rockies and Andes were thrust up, and that
the rude outlines of our present oceans and continents appeared. The
map of the world begins to display a first dim resemblance to the map
of to-day. It is estimated now that between forty and eighty million
years have elapsed from the beginnings of the Cainozoic period to the
present time.

At the outset of the Cainozoic period the climate of the world was
austere.  It grew generally warmer until a fresh phase of great
abundance was reached, after which conditions grew hard again and the
earth passed into a series of extremely cold cycles, the Glacial Ages,
from which apparently it is now slowly emerging.

But we do not know sufficient of the causes of climatic change at
present to forecast the possible fluctuations of climatic conditions
that lie before us.  We may be moving towards increasing sunshine or
lapsing towards another glacial age; volcanic activity and the upheaval
of mountain masses may be increasing or diminishing; we do not know; we
lack sufficient science.

With the opening of this period the grasses appear; for the first time
there is pasture in the world; and with the full development of the
once obscure mammalian type, appear a number of interesting grazing
animals and of carnivorous types which prey upon these.

At first these early mammals seem to differ only in a few characters
from the great herbivorous and carnivorous reptiles that ages before
had flourished and then vanished from the earth.  A careless observer
might suppose that in this second long age of warmth and plenty that
was now beginning, nature was merely repeating the first, with
herbivorous and carnivorous mammals to parallel the herbivorous and
carnivorous dinosaurs, with birds replacing pterodactyls and so on. 
But this would be an altogether superficial comparison.  The variety of
the universe is infinite and incessant; it progresses eternally;
history never repeats itself and no parallels are precisely true. The
differences between the life of the Cainozoic and Mesozoic periods are
far profounder than the resemblances.

The most fundamental of all these differences lies in the mental life
of the two periods.  It arises essentially out of the continuing
contact of parent and offspring which distinguishes mammalian and in a
lesser degree bird life, from the life of the reptile.  With very few
exceptions the reptile abandons its egg to hatch alone.  The young
reptile has no knowledge whatever of its parent; its mental life, such
as it is, begins and ends with its own experiences. It may tolerate the
existence of its fellows but it has no communication with them; it
never imitates, never learns from them, is incapable of concerted
action with them.  Its life is that of an isolated individual.  But
with the suckling and cherishing of young which was distinctive of the
new mammalian and avian strains arose the possibility of learning by
imitation, of communication, by warning cries and other concerted
action, of mutual control and instruction.  A teachable type of life
had come into the world.

The earliest mammals of the Cainozoic period are but little superior in
brain size to the more active carnivorous dinosaurs, but as we read on
through the record towards modern times we find, in every tribe and
race of the mammalian animals, a steady universal increase in brain
capacity.  For instance we find at a comparatively early stage that
rhinoceros-like beasts appear.  There is a creature, the Titanotherium,
which lived in the earliest division of this period.  It was probably
very like a modern rhinoceros in its habits and needs.  But its brain
capacity was not one tenth that of its living successor.

The earlier mammals probably parted from their offspring as soon as
suckling was over, but, once the capacity for mutual understanding has
arisen, the advantages of continuing the association are very great;
and we presently find a number of mammalian species displaying the
beginnings of a true social life and keeping together in herds, packs
and flocks, watching each other, imitating each other, taking warning
from each other’s acts and cries.  This is something that the world had
not seen before among vertebrated animals. Reptiles and fish may no
doubt be found in swarms and shoals; they have been hatched in
quantities and similar conditions have kept them together, but in the
case of the social and gregarious mammals the association arises not
simply from a community of external forces, it is sustained by an inner
impulse.  They are not merely like one another and so found in the same
places at the same times; they like one another and so they keep
together.

This difference between the reptile world and the world of our human
minds is one our sympathies seem unable to pass. We cannot conceive in
ourselves the swift uncomplicated urgency of a reptile’s instinctive
motives, its appetites, fears and hates.  We cannot understand them in
their simplicity because all our motives are complicated; our’s are
balances and resultants and not simple urgencies.  But the mammals and
birds have self-restraint and consideration for other individuals, a
social appeal, a self- control that is, at its lower level, after our
own fashion. We can in consequence establish relations with almost all
sorts of them.  When they suffer they utter cries and make movements
that rouse our feelings.  We can make understanding pets of them with a
mutual recognition.  They can be tamed to self-restraint towards us,
domesticated and taught.

That unusual growth of brain which is the central fact of Cainozoic
times marks a new communication and interdependence of individuals.  It
foreshadows the development of human societies of which we shall soon
be telling.

As the Cainozoic period unrolled, the resemblance of its flora and
fauna to the plants and animals that inhabit the world to-day
increased.  The big clumsy Uintatheres and Titanotheres, the
Entelodonts and Hyracodons, big clumsy brutes like nothing living,
disappeared.  On the other hand a series of forms led up by steady
degrees from grotesque and clumsy predecessors to the giraffes, camels,
horses, elephants, deer, dogs and lions and tigers of the existing
world.  The evolution of the horse is particularly legible upon the
geological record.  We have a fairly complete series of forms from a
small tapir-like ancestor in the early Cainozoic.  Another line of
development that has now been pieced together with some precision is
that of the llamas and camels.




IX
MONKEYS, APES AND SUB-MEN


Naturalists divide the class _Mammalia_ into a number of orders. At the
head of these is the order _Primates_, which includes the lemurs, the
monkeys, apes and man. Their classification was based originally upon
anatomical resemblances and took no account of any mental qualities.

Now the past history of the Primates is one very difficult to decipher
in the geological record.  They are for the most part animals which
live in forests like the lemurs and monkeys or in bare rocky places
like the baboons.  They are rarely drowned and covered up by sediment,
nor are most of them very numerous species, and so they do not figure
so largely among the fossils as the ancestors of the horses, camels and
so forth do.  But we know that quite early in the Cainozoic period,
that is to say some forty million years ago or so, primitive monkeys
and lemuroid creatures had appeared, poorer in brain and not so
specialized as their later successors.

The great world summer of the middle Cainozoic period drew at last to
an end.  It was to follow those other two great summers in the history
of life, the summer of the Coal Swamps and the vast summer of the Age
of Reptiles.  Once more the earth spun towards an ice age.  The world
chilled, grew milder for a time and chilled again.  In the warm past
hippopotami had wallowed through a lush sub-tropical vegetation, and a
tremendous tiger with fangs like sabres, the sabre-toothed tiger, had
hunted its prey where now the journalists of Fleet Street go to and
fro.  Now came a bleaker age and still bleaker ages.  A great weeding
and extinction of species occurred.  A woolly rhinoceros, adapted to a
cold climate, and the mammoth, a big woolly cousin of the elephants,
the Arctic musk ox and the reindeer passed across the scene.  Then
century by century the Arctic ice cap, the wintry death of the great
Ice Age, crept southward.  In England it came almost down to the
Thames, in America it reached Ohio.  There would be warmer spells of a
few thousand years and relapses towards a bitterer cold.

Geologists talk of these wintry phases as the First, Second, Third and
Fourth Glacial Ages, and of the interludes as Interglacial periods.  We
live to-day in a world that is still impoverished and scarred by that
terrible winter.  The First Glacial Age was coming on 600,000 years
ago; the Fourth Glacial Age reached its bitterest some fifty thousand
years ago.  And it was amidst the snows of this long universal winter
that the first man-like beings lived upon our planet.

A MAMMOTH
A MAMMOTH

By the middle Cainozoic period there have appeared various apes with
many quasi-human attributes of the jaws and leg bones, but it is only
as we approach these Glacial Ages that we find traces of creatures that
we can speak of as “almost human.”  These traces are not bones but
implements.  In Europe, in deposits of this period, between half a
million and a million years old, we find flints and stones that have
evidently been chipped intentionally by some handy creature desirous of
hammering, scraping or fighting with the sharpened edge.  These things
have been called “Eoliths” (dawn stones).  In Europe there are no bones
nor other remains of the creature which made these objects, simply the
objects themselves.  For all the certainty we have it may have been
some entirely un-human but intelligent monkey.  But at Trinil in Java,
in accumulations of this age, a piece of a skull and various teeth and
bones have been found of a sort of ape man, with a brain case bigger
than that of any living apes, which seems to have walked erect.  This
creature is now called _Pithecanthropus erectus_, the walking ape man,
and the little trayful of its bones is the only help our imaginations
have as yet in figuring to, ourselves the makers of the Eoliths.

FLINT IMPLEMENTS FOUND IN PILTDOWN REGION

It is not until we come to sands that are almost a quarter of a million
years old that we find any other particle of a sub- human being.  But
there are plenty of implements, and they are steadily improving in
quality as we read on through the record.  They are no longer clumsy
Eoliths; they are now shapely instruments made with considerable skill.
 _And they are much bigger than the similar implements afterwards made
by true man._  Then, in a sandpit at Heidelberg, appears a single
quasi-human jaw-bone, a clumsy jaw-bone, absolutely chinless, far
heavier than a true human jaw-bone and narrower, so that it is
improbable the creature’s tongue could have moved about for articulate
speech.  On the strength of this jaw-bone, scientific men suppose this
creature to have been a heavy, almost human monster, possibly with huge
limbs and hands, possibly with a thick felt of hair, and they call it
the Heidelberg Man.

This jaw-bone is, I think, one of the most tormenting objects in the
world to our human curiosity.  To see it is like looking through a
defective glass into the past and catching just one blurred and
tantalizing glimpse of this Thing, shambling through the bleak
wilderness, clambering to avoid the sabre- toothed tiger, watching the
woolly rhinoceros in the woods. Then before we can scrutinize the
monster, he vanishes.  Yet the soil is littered abundantly with the
indestructible implements he chipped out for his uses.

Still more fascinatingly enigmatical are the remains of a creature
found at Piltdown in Sussex in a deposit that may indicate an age
between a hundred and a hundred and fifty thousand years ago, though
some authorities would put these particular remains back in time to
before the Heidelberg jaw- bone. Here there are the remains of a thick
sub-human skull much larger than any existing ape’s, and a
chimpanzee-like jaw-bone which may or may not belong to it, and, in
addition, a bat-shaped piece of elephant bone evidently carefully
manufactured, through which a hole had apparently been bored.  There is
also the thigh-bone of a deer with cuts upon it like a tally.  That is
all.

THE PILTDOWN SKULL, AS RECONSTRUCTED FROM ORIGINAL FRAGMENT

_Nat. Hist. Mus._

What sort of beast was this creature which sat and bored holes in
bones?

Scientific men have named him Eoanthropus, the Dawn Man.  He stands
apart from his kindred; a very different being either from the
Heidelberg creature or from any living ape.  No other vestige like him
is known.  But the gravels and deposits of from one hundred thousand
years onward are increasingly rich in implements of flint and similar
stone. And these implements are no longer rude “Eoliths.” The
archæologists are presently able to distinguish scrapers, borers,
knives, darts, throwing stones and hand axes ....

We are drawing very near to man.  In our next section we shall have to
describe the strangest of all these precursors of humanity, the
Neanderthalers, the men who were almost, but not quite, true men.

But it may be well perhaps to state quite clearly here that no
scientific man supposes either of these creatures, the Heidelberg Man
or _Eoanthropus_, to be direct ancestors of the men of to-day.  These
are, at the closest, related forms.




X
THE NEANDERTHALER AND THE RHODESIAN MAN


About fifty or sixty thousand years ago, before the climax of the
Fourth Glacial Age, there lived a creature on earth so like a man that
until a few years ago its remains were considered to be altogether
human. We have skulls and bones of it and a great accumulation of the
large implements it made and used. It made fires. It sheltered in caves
from the cold. It probably dressed skins roughly and wore them. It was
right-handed as men are.

Yet now the ethnologists tell us these creatures were not true men. 
They were of a different species of the same genus.  They had heavy
protruding jaws and great brow ridges above the eyes and very low
foreheads.  Their thumbs were not opposable to the fingers as men’s
are; their necks were so poised that they could not turn back their
heads and look up to the sky.  They probably slouched along, head down
and forward.  Their chinless jaw-bones resemble the Heidelberg jaw-bone
and are markedly unlike human jaw-bones.  And there were great
differences from the human pattern in their teeth. Their cheek teeth
were more complicated in structure than ours, more complicated and not
less so; they had not the long fangs of our cheek teeth; and also these
quasi-men had not the marked canines (dog teeth) of an ordinary human
being. The capacity of their skulls was quite human, but the brain was
bigger behind and lower in front than the human brain. Their
intellectual faculties were differently arranged.  They were not
ancestral to the human line. Mentally and physically they were upon a
different line from the human line.

Skulls and bones of this extinct species of man were found at
Neanderthal among other places, and from that place these strange
proto-men have been christened Neanderthal Men, or Neanderthalers. They
must have endured in Europe for many hundreds or even thousands of
years.

THE NEANDERTHALER, ACCORDING TO PROF. RUTOT
THE NEANDERTHALER, ACCORDING TO PROF. RUTOT

At that time the climate and geography of our world was very different
from what they are at the present time. Europe for example was covered
with ice reaching as far south as the Thames and into Central Germany
and Russia; there was no Channel separating Britain from France; the
Mediterranean and the Red Sea were great valleys, with perhaps a chain
of lakes in their deeper portions, and a great inland sea spread from
the present Black Sea across South Russia and far into Central Asia. 
Spain and all of Europe not actually under ice consisted of bleak
uplands under a harder climate than that of Labrador, and it was only
when North Africa was reached that one would have found a temperate
climate.  Across the cold steppes of Southern Europe with its sparse
arctic vegetation, drifted such hardy creatures as the woolly mammoth,
and woolly rhinoceros, great oxen and reindeer, no doubt following the
vegetation northward in spring and southward in autumn.

Map: Possible Outline of Europe and Western Asia at the Maximum of the
Fourth Ice Age (about 50,000 years ago)

Such was the scene through which the Neanderthaler wandered, gathering
such subsistence as he could from small game or fruits and berries and
roots.  Possibly he was mainly a vegetarian, chewing twigs and roots. 
His level elaborate teeth suggest a largely vegetarian dietary.  But we
also find the long marrow bones of great animals in his caves, cracked
to extract the marrow.  His weapons could not have been of much avail
in open conflict with great beasts, but it is supposed that he attacked
them with spears at difficult river crossings and even constructed
pitfalls for them.  Possibly he followed the herds and preyed upon any
dead that were killed in fights, and perhaps he played the part of
jackal to the sabre-toothed tiger which still survived in his day. 
Possibly in the bitter hardships of the Glacial Ages this creature had
taken to attacking animals after long ages of vegetarian adaptation.

We cannot guess what this Neanderthal man looked like. He may have been
very hairy and very unhuman-looking indeed.  It is even doubtful if he
went erect.  He may have used his knuckles as well as his feet to hold
himself up. Probably he went about alone or in small family groups.  It
is inferred from the structure of his jaw that he was incapable of
speech as we understand it.

For thousands of years these Neanderthalers were the highest animals
that the European area had ever seen; and then some thirty or
thirty-five thousand years ago as the climate grew warmer a race of
kindred beings, more intelligent, knowing more, talking and
co-operating together, came drifting into the Neanderthaler’s world
from the south.  They ousted the Neanderthalers from their caves and
squatting places; they hunted the same food; they probably made war
upon their grisly predecessors and killed them off.  These newcomers
from the south or the east—for at present we do not know their region
of origin—who at last drove the Neanderthalers out of existence
altogether, were beings of our own blood and kin, the first True Men. 
Their brain-cases and thumbs and necks and teeth were anatomically the
same as our own.  In a cave at Cro-Magnon and in another at Grimaldi, a
number of skeletons have been found, the earliest truly human remains
that are so far known.

So it is our race comes into the Record of the Rocks, and the story of
mankind begins.

The world was growing liker our own in those days though the climate
was still austere.  The glaciers of the Ice Age were receding in
Europe; the reindeer of France and Spain presently gave way to great
herds of horses as grass increased upon the steppes, and the mammoth
became more and more rare in southern Europe and finally receded
northward altogether ....

We do not know where the True Men first originated.  But in the summer
of 1921, an extremely interesting skull was found together with pieces
of a skeleton at Broken Hill in South Africa, which seems to be a relic
of a third sort of man, intermediate in its characteristics between the
Neanderthaler and the human being.  The brain-case indicates a brain
bigger in front and smaller behind than the Neanderthaler’s, and the
skull was poised erect upon the backbone in a quite human way.  The
teeth also and the bones are quite human. But the face must have been
ape-like with enormous brow ridges and a ridge along the middle of the
skull.  The creature was indeed a true man, so to speak, with an ape-
like, Neanderthaler face.  This Rhodesian Man is evidently still closer
to real men than the Neanderthal Man.

This Rhodesian skull is probably only the second of what in the end may
prove to be a long list of finds of sub-human species which lived on
the earth in the vast interval of time between the beginnings of the
Ice Age and the appearance of their common heir, and perhaps their
common exterminator, the True Man.  The Rhodesian skull itself may not
be very ancient.  Up to the time of publishing this book there has been
no exact determination of its probable age. It may be that this
sub-human creature survived in South Africa until quite recent times.




XI
THE FIRST TRUE MEN


The earliest signs and traces at present known to science, of a
humanity which is indisputably kindred with ourselves, have been found
in western Europe and particularly in France and Spain. Bones, weapons,
scratchings upon bone and rock, carved fragments of bone, and paintings
in caves and upon rock surfaces dating. it is supposed. from 30,000
years ago or more, have been discovered in both these countries. Spain
is at present the richest country in the world in these first relics of
our real human ancestors.

Of course our present collections of these things are the merest
beginnings of the accumulations we may hope for in the future, when
there are searchers enough to make a thorough examination of all
possible sources and when other countries in the world, now
inaccessible to archæologists, have been explored in some detail.  The
greater part of Africa and Asia has never even been traversed yet by a
trained observer interested in these matters and free to explore, and
we must be very careful therefore not to conclude that the early true
men were distinctively inhabitants of western Europe or that they first
appeared in that region.

In Asia or Africa or submerged beneath the sea of to-day there may be
richer and much earlier deposits of real human remains than anything
that has yet come to light.  I write in Asia or Africa, and I do not
mention America because so far there have been no finds at all of any
of the higher Primates, either of great apes, sub-men, Neanderthalers
nor early true men.  This development of life seems to have been an
exclusively old world development, and it was only apparently at the
end of the Old Stone Age that human beings first made their way across
the land connexion that is now cut by Behring Straits, into the
American continent.

etc., painted in the soft tones of red shaded to black. They may be
fifteen or twenty thousand years old

These first real human beings we know of in Europe appear already to
have belonged to one or other of at least two very distinct races. One
of these races was of a very high type indeed; it was tall and big
brained.  One of the women’s skulls found exceeds in capacity that of
the average man of to-day.  One of the men’s skeletons is over six feet
in height.  The physical type resembled that of the North American
Indian.  From the Cro-Magnon cave in which the first skeletons were
found these people have been called Cro-Magnards.  They were savages,
but savages of a high order. The second race, the race of the Grimaldi
cave remains, was distinctly negroid in its characters.  Its nearest
living affinities are the Bushmen and Hottentots of South Africa.  It
is interesting to find at the very outset of the known human story,
that mankind was already racially divided into at least two main
varieties; and one is tempted to such unwarrantable guesses as that the
former race was probably brownish rather than black and that it came
from the East or North, and that the latter was blackish rather than
brown and came from the equatorial south.

_Brit. Mus._

And these savages of perhaps forty thousand years ago were so human
that they pierced shells to make necklaces, painted themselves, carved
images of bone and stone, scratched figures on rocks and bones, and
painted rude but often very able sketches of beasts and the like upon
the smooth walls of caves and upon inviting rock surfaces.  They made a
great variety of implements, much smaller in scale and finer than those
of the Neanderthal men.  We have now in our museums great quantities of
their implements, their statuettes, their rock drawings and the like.

The earliest of them were hunters.  Their chief pursuit was the wild
horse, the little bearded pony of that time.  They followed it as it
moved after pasture.  And also they followed the bison.  They knew the
mammoth, because they have left us strikingly effective pictures of
that creature.  To judge by one rather ambiguous drawing they trapped
and killed it.

They hunted with spears and throwing stones.  They do not seem to have
had the bow, and it is doubtful if they had yet learnt to tame any
animals.  They had no dogs.  There is one carving of a horse’s head and
one or two drawings that suggest a bridled horse, with a twisted skin
or tendon round it.  But the little horses of that age and region could
not have carried a man, and if the horse was domesticated it was used
as a led horse.  It is doubtful and improbable that they had yet learnt
the rather unnatural use of animal’s milk as food.

They do not seem to have erected any buildings though they may have had
tents of skins, and though they made clay figures they never rose to
the making of pottery.  Since they had no cooking implements their
cookery must have been rudimentary or nonexistent.  They knew nothing
of cultivation and nothing of any sort of basket work or woven cloth.
Except for their robes of skin or fur they were naked painted savages.

These earliest known men hunted the open steppes of Europe for a
hundred centuries perhaps, and then slowly drifted and changed before a
change of climate.  Europe, century by century, was growing milder and
damper. Reindeer receded northward and eastward, and bison and horse
followed.  The steppes gave way to forests, and red deer took the place
of horse and bison. There is a change in the character of the
implements with this change in their application.  River and lake
fishing becomes of great importance to men, and fine implements of bone
increased.  “The bone needles of this age,” says de Mortillet, “are
much superior to those of later, even historical times, down to the
Renaissance.  The Romans, for example, never had needles comparable to
those of this epoch.”

Almost fifteen or twelve thousand years ago a fresh people drifted into
the south of Spain, and left very remarkable drawings of themselves
upon exposed rock faces there.  These were the Azilians (named from the
Mas d’Azil cave). They had the bow; they seem to have worn feather
headdresses; they drew vividly; but also they had reduced their
drawings to a sort of symbolism—a man for instance would be represented
by a vertical dab with two or three horizontal dabs—that suggest the
dawn of the writing idea. Against hunting sketches there are often
marks like tallies. One drawing shows two men smoking out a bees’ nest.

FIGHT OF BOWMEN
Among the most recent discoveries of Palæolithic Art are these
specimens found in 1920 in Spain.  They are probably ten or twelve
thousand years old

These are the latest of the men that we call Palæolithic (Old Stone
Age) because they had only chipped implements.  By ten or twelve
thousand years a new sort of life has dawned in Europe, men have learnt
not only to chip but to polish and grind stone implements, and they
have begun cultivation.  The Neolithic Age (New Stone Age) was
beginning.

It is interesting to note that less than a century ago there still
survived in a remote part of the world, in Tasmania, a race of human
beings at a lower level of physical and intellectual development than
any of these earliest races of mankind who have left traces in Europe. 
These people had long ago been cut off by geographical changes from the
rest of the species, and from stimulation and improvement.  They seem
to have degenerated rather than developed.  They lived a base life
subsisting upon shellfish and small game.  They had no habitations but
only squatting places.  They were real men of our species, but they had
neither the manual dexterity nor the artistic powers of the first true
men.




XII
PRIMITIVE THOUGHT


And now let us indulge in a very interesting speculation; how did it
feel to be a man in those early days of the human adventure? How did
men think and what did they think in those remote days of hunting and
wandering four hundred centuries ago before seed time and harvest
began. Those were days long before the written record of any human
impressions, and we are left almost entirely to inference and guesswork
in our answers to these questions.

The sources to which scientific men have gone in their attempts to
reconstruct that primitive mentality are very various.  Recently the
science of psycho-analysis, which analyzes the way in which the
egotistic and passionate impulses of the child are restrained,
suppressed, modified or overlaid, to adapt them to the needs of social
life, seems to have thrown a considerable amount of light upon the
history of primitive society; and another fruitful source of suggestion
has been the study of the ideas and customs of such contemporary
savages as still survive.  Again there is a sort of mental
fossilization which we find in folk-lore and the deep-lying irrational
superstitions and prejudices that still survive among modern civilized
people.  And finally we have in the increasingly numerous pictures,
statues, carvings, symbols and the like, as we draw near to our own
time, clearer and clearer indications of what man found interesting and
worthy of record and representation.

Primitive man probably thought very much as a child thinks, that is to
say in a series of imaginative pictures.  He conjured up images or
images presented themselves to his mind, and he acted in accordance
with the emotions they aroused.  So a child or an uneducated person
does to-day. Systematic thinking is apparently a comparatively late
development in human experience; it has not played any great part in
human life until within the last three thousand years.  And even to-day
those who really control and order their thoughts are but a small
minority of mankind.  Most of the world still lives by imagination and
passion.

Probably the earliest human societies, in the opening stages of the
true human story, were small family groups.  Just as the flocks and
herds of the earlier mammals arose out of families which remained
together and multiplied, so probably did the earliest tribes.  But
before this could happen a certain restraint upon the primitive
egotisms of the individual had to be established.  The fear of the
father and respect for the mother had to be extended into adult life,
and the natural jealousy of the old man of the group for the younger
males as they grew up had to be mitigated.  The mother on the other
hand was the natural adviser and protector of the young.  Human social
life grew up out of the reaction between the crude instinct of the
young to go off and pair by themselves as they grew up, on the one
hand, and the dangers and disadvantages of separation on the other.  An
anthropological writer of great genius, J. J. Atkinson, in his _Primal
Law_, has shown how much of the customary law of savages, the _Tabus_,
that are so remarkable a fact in tribal life, can be ascribed to such a
mental adjustment of the needs of the primitive human animal to a
developing social life, and the later work of the psycho- analysts has
done much to confirm his interpretation of these possibilities.

Some speculative writers would have us believe that respect and fear of
the Old Man and the emotional reaction of the primitive savage to older
protective women, exaggerated in dreams and enriched by fanciful mental
play, played a large part in the beginnings of primitive religion and
in the conception of gods and goddesses.  Associated with this respect
for powerful or helpful personalities was a dread and exaltation of
such personages after their deaths, due to their reappearance in
dreams.  It was easy to believe they were not truly dead but only
fantastically transferred to a remoteness of greater power.

The dreams, imaginations and fears of a child are far more vivid and
real than those of a modern adult, and primitive man was always
something of a child. He was nearer to the animals also, and he could
suppose them to have motives and reactions like his own.  He could
imagine animal helpers, animal enemies, animal gods.  One needs to have
been an imaginative child oneself to realize again how important,
significant, portentous or friendly, strangely shaped rocks, lumps of
wood, exceptional trees or the like may have appeared to the men of the
Old Stone Age, and how dream and fancy would create stories and legends
about such things that would become credible as they told them.  Some
of these stories would be good enough to remember and tell again.  The
women would tell them to the children and so establish a tradition.  To
this day most imaginative children invent long stories in which some
favourite doll or animal or some fantastic semi-human being figures as
the hero, and primitive man probably did the same—with a much stronger
disposition to believe his hero real.

_Brit. Mus._

For the very earliest of the true men that we know of were probably
quite talkative beings.  In that way they have differed from the
Neanderthalers and had an advantage over them.  The Neanderthaler may
have been a dumb animal. Of course the primitive human speech was
probably a very scanty collection of names, and may have been eked out
with gestures and signs.

There is no sort of savage so low as not to have a kind of science of
cause and effect.  But primitive man was not very critical in his
associations of cause with effect; he very easily connected an effect
with something quite wrong as its cause. “You do so and so,” he said,
“and so and so happens.”  You give a child a poisonous berry and it
dies.  You eat the heart of a valiant enemy and you become strong. 
There we have two bits of cause and effect association, one true one
false.  We call the system of cause and effect in the mind of a savage,
Fetish; but Fetish is simply savage science.  It differs from modern
science in that it is totally unsystematic and uncritical and so more
frequently wrong.

_Brit. Mus._

In many cases it is not difficult to link cause and effect, in many
others erroneous ideas were soon corrected by experience; but there was
a large series of issues of very great importance to primitive man,
where he sought persistently for causes and found explanations that
were wrong but not sufficiently wrong nor so obviously wrong as to be
detected.  It was a matter of great importance to him that game should
be abundant or fish plentiful and easily caught, and no doubt he tried
and believed in a thousand charms, incantations and omens to determine
these desirable results.  Another great concern of his was illness and
death.  Occasionally infections crept through the land and men died of
them.  Occasionally men were stricken by illness and died or were
enfeebled without any manifest cause.  This too must have given the
hasty, emotional mind of primitive man much feverish exercise. Dreams
and fantastic guesses made him blame this, or appeal for help to that
man or beast or thing.  He had the child’s aptitude for fear and panic.

Quite early in the little human tribe, older, steadier minds sharing
the fears, sharing the imaginations, but a little more forceful than
the others, must have asserted themselves, to advise, to prescribe, to
command. This they declared unpropitious and that imperative, this an
omen of good and that an omen of evil.  The expert in Fetish, the
Medicine Man, was the first priest.  He exhorted, he interpreted
dreams, he warned, he performed the complicated hocus pocus that
brought luck or averted calamity.  Primitive religion was not so much
what we now call religion as practice and observance, and the early
priest dictated what was indeed an arbitrary primitive practical
science.




XIII
THE BEGINNINGS OF CULTIVATION


We are still very ignorant about the beginnings of cultivation and
settlement in the world although a vast amount of research and
speculation has been given to these matters in the last fifty years.
All that we can say with any confidence at present is that somewhen
about 15,000 and 12,000 B.C. while the Azilian people were in the south
of Spain and while the remnants of the earlier hunters were drifting
northward and eastward, somewhere in North Africa or Western Asia or in
that great Mediterranean valley that is now submerged under the waters
of the Mediterranean sea, there were people who, age by age, were
working out two vitally important things; they were beginning
cultivation and they were domesticating animals. They were also
beginning to make, in addition to the chipped implements of their
hunter forebears, implements of polished stone. They had discovered the
possibility of basketwork and roughly woven textiles of plant fibre,
and they were beginning to make a rudely modelled pottery.

They were entering upon a new phase in human culture, the Neolithic
phase (New Stone Age) as distinguished from the Palæolithic (Old Stone)
phase of the Cro-Magnards, the Grimaldi people, the Azilians and their
like.  [1] Slowly these Neolithic people spread over the warmer parts
of the world; and the arts they had mastered, the plants and animals
they had learnt to use, spread by imitation and acquisition even more
widely than they did.  By 10,000 B.C., most of mankind was at the
Neolithic level.

Now the ploughing of land, the sowing of seed, the reaping of harvest,
threshing and grinding, may seem the most obviously reasonable steps to
a modern mind just as to a modern mind it is a commonplace that the
world is round.  What else could you do? people will ask.  What else
can it be?  But to the primitive man of twenty thousand years ago
neither of the systems of action and reasoning that seem so sure and
manifest to us to-day were at all obvious.  He felt his way to
effectual practice through a multitude of trials and misconceptions,
with fantastic and unnecessary elaborations and false interpretations
at every turn.  Somewhere in the Mediterranean region, wheat grew wild;
and man may have learnt to pound and then grind up its seeds for food
long before he learnt to sow.  He reaped before he sowed.

And it is a very remarkable thing that throughout the world wherever
there is sowing and harvesting there is still traceable the vestiges of
a strong primitive association of the idea of sowing with the idea of a
blood sacrifice, and primarily of the sacrifice of a human being.  The
study of the original entanglement of these two things is a profoundly
attractive one to the curious mind; the interested reader will find it
very fully developed in that monumental work, Sir J. G. Frazer’s
_Golden Bough_.  It was an entanglement, we must remember, in the
childish, dreaming, myth-making primitive mind; no reasoned process
will explain it.  But in that world of 12,000 to 20,000 years ago, it
would seem that whenever seed time came round to the Neolithic peoples
there was a human sacrifice.  And it was not the sacrifice of any mean
or outcast person; it was the sacrifice usually of a chosen youth or
maiden, a youth more often who was treated with profound deference and
even worship up to the moment of his immolation.  He was a sort of
sacrificial god-king, and all the details of his killing had become a
ritual directed by the old, knowing men and sanctioned by the
accumulated usage of ages.

At first primitive men, with only a very rough idea of the seasons,
must have found great difficulty in determining when was the propitious
moment for the seed-time sacrifice and the sowing.  There is some
reason for supposing that there was an early stage in human experience
when men had no idea of a year. The first chronology was in lunar
months; it is supposed that the years of the Biblical patriarchs are
really moons, and the Babylonian calendar shows distinct traces of an
attempt to reckon seed time by taking thirteen lunar months to see it
round. This lunar influence upon the calendar reaches down to our own
days. If usage did not dull our sense of its strangeness we should
think it a very remarkable thing indeed that the Christian Church does
not commemorate the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Christ on the
proper anniversaries but on dates that vary year by year with the
phases of the moon.

It may be doubted whether the first agriculturalists made any
observation of the stars.  It is more likely that stars were first
observed by migratory herdsmen, who found them a convenient mark of
direction.  But once their use in determining seasons was realized,
their importance to agriculture became very great.  The seed-time
sacrifice was linked up with the southing or northing of some prominent
star.  A myth and worship of that star was for primitive man an almost
inevitable consequence.

It is easy to see how important the man of knowledge and experience,
the man who knew about the blood sacrifice and the stars, became in
this early Neolithic world.

The fear of uncleanness and pollution, and the methods of cleansing
that were advisable, constituted another source of power for the
knowledgeable men and women. For there have always been witches as well
as wizards, and priestesses as well as priests.  The early priest was
really not so much a religious man as a man of applied science.  His
science was generally empirical and often bad; he kept it secret from
the generality of men very jealously; but that does not alter the fact
that his primary function was knowledge and that his primary use was a
practical use.

_Brit. Mus._

Twelve or fifteen thousand years ago, in all the warm and fairly
well-watered parts of the Old World these Neolithic human communities,
with their class and tradition of priests and priestesses and their
cultivated fields and their development of villages and little walled
cities, were spreading.  Age by age a drift and exchange of ideas went
on between these communities.  Eliot Smith and Rivers have used the
term “Heliolithic culture” for the culture of these first agricultural
peoples.  “Heliolithic” (Sun and Stone) is not perhaps the best
possible word to use for this, but until scientific men give us a
better one we shall have to use it.  Originating somewhere in the
Mediterranean and western Asiatic area, it spread age by age eastward
and from island to island across the Pacific until it may even have
reached America and mingled with the more primitive ways of living of
the Mongoloid immigrants coming down from the North.

Wherever the brownish people with the Heliolithic culture went they
took with them all or most of a certain group of curious ideas and
practices.  Some of them are such queer ideas that they call for the
explanation of the mental expert.  They made pyramids and great mounds,
and set up great circles of big stones, perhaps to facilitate the
astronomical observation of the priests; they made mummies of some or
all of their dead; they tattooed and circumcized; they had the old
custom, known as the _couvade_, of sending the _father_ to bed and rest
when a child was born, and they had as a luck symbol the well-known
Swastika.

If we were to make a map of the world with dots to show how far these
group practices have left their traces, we should make a belt along the
temperate and sub-tropical coasts of the world from Stonehenge and
Spain across the world to Mexico and Peru.  But Africa below the
equator, north central Europe, and north Asia would show none of these
dottings; there lived races who were developing along practically
independent lines.

[1] The term Palæolithic we may note is also used to cover the
Neanderthaler and even the Eolithic implements.  The pre-human age is
called the “Older Palæolithic;” the age of true men using unpolished
stones in the “Newer Palæolithic.”


XIV
PRIMITIVE NEOLITHIC CIVILIZATIONS


About 10,000 B.C. the geography of the world was very similar in its
general outline to that of the world to-day. It is probable that by
that time the great barrier across the Straits of Gibraltar that had
hitherto banked back the ocean waters from the Mediterranean valley had
been eaten through, and that the Mediterranean was a sea following much
the same coastlines as it does now. The Caspian Sea was probably still
far more extensive than it is at present, and it may have been
continuous with the Black Sea to the north of the Caucasus Mountains.
About this great Central Asian sea lands that are now steppes and
deserts were fertile and habitable. Generally it was a moister and more
fertile world. European Russia was much more a land of swamp and lake
than it is now, and there may still have been a land connexion between
Asia and America at Behring Straits.

It would have been already possible at that time to have distinguished
the main racial divisions of mankind as we know them to-day.  Across
the warm temperate regions of this rather warmer and better-wooded
world, and along the coasts, stretched the brownish peoples of the
Heliolithic culture, the ancestors of the bulk of the living
inhabitants of the Mediterranean world, of the Berbers, the Egyptians
and of much of the population of South and Eastern Asia.  This great
race had of course a number of varieties.  The Iberian or Mediterranean
or “dark-white” race of the Atlantic and Mediterranean coast, the
“Hamitic” peoples which include the Berbers and Egyptians, the
Dravidians; the darker people of India, a multitude of East Indian
people, many Polynesian races and the Maoris are all divisions of
various value of this great main mass of humanity.  Its western
varieties are whiter than its eastern.

In the forests of central and northern Europe a more blonde variety of
men with blue eyes was becoming distinguishable, branching off from the
main mass of brownish people, a variety which many people now speak of
as the Nordic race.  In the more open regions of northeastern Asia was
another differentiation of this brownish humanity in the direction of a
type with more oblique eyes, high cheek-bones, a yellowish skin, and
very straight black hair, the Mongolian peoples.  In South Africa,
Australia, in many tropical islands in the south of Asia were remains
of the early negroid peoples. The central parts of Africa were already
a region of racial intermixture. Nearly all the coloured races of
Africa to-day seem to be blends of the brownish peoples of the north
with a negroid substratum.


A Diagrammatic Summary of Current Ideas of the Relationship of Human
Races

We have to remember that human races can all interbreed freely and that
they separate, mingle and reunite as clouds do.  Human races do not
branch out like trees with branches that never come together again.  It
is a thing we need to bear constantly in mind, this remingling of races
at any opportunity.  It will save us from many cruel delusions and
prejudices if we do so.  People will use such a word as race in the
loosest manner, and base the most preposterous generalizations upon it.
 They will speak of a “British” race or of a “European” race.  But
nearly all the European nations are confused mixtures of brownish,
dark-white, white and Mongolian elements.

It was at the Neolithic phase of human development that peoples of the
Mongolian breed first made their way into America.  Apparently they
came by way of Behring Straits and spread southward.  They found
caribou, the American reindeer, in the north and great herds of bison
in the south.  When they reached South America there were still living
the Glyptodon, a gigantic armadillo, and the Megatherium, a monstrous
clumsy sloth as high as an elephant.  They probably exterminated the
latter beast, which was as helpless as it was big.

The greater portion of these American tribes never rose above a hunting
nomadic Neolithic life.  They never discovered the use of iron, and
their chief metal possessions were native gold and copper.  But in
Mexico, Yucatan and Peru conditions existed favourable to settled
cultivation, and here about 1000 B.C. or so arose very interesting
civilizations of a parallel but different type from the old-world
civilization.  Like the much earlier primitive civilizations of the old
world these communities displayed a great development of human
sacrifice about the processes of seed time and harvest; but while in
the old world, as we shall see, these primary ideas were ultimately
mitigated, complicated and overlaid by others, in America they
developed and were elaborated, to a very high degree of intensity. 
These American civilized countries were essentially priest-ruled
countries; their war chiefs and rulers were under a rigorous rule of
law and omen.

These priests carried astronomical science to a high level of accuracy.
 They knew their year better than the Babylonians of whom we shall
presently tell.  In Yucatan they had a kind of writing, the Maya
writing, of the most curious and elaborate character.  So far as we
have been able to decipher it, it was used mainly for keeping the exact
and complicated calendars upon which the priests expended their
intelligence. The art of the Maya civilization came to a climax about
700 or 800 A.D.  The sculptured work of these people amazes the modern
observer by its great plastic power and its frequent beauty, and
perplexes him by a grotesqueness and by a sort of insane
conventionality and intricacy outside the circle of his ideas.  There
is nothing quite like it in the old world.  The nearest approach, and
that is a remote one, is found in archaic Indian carvings. Everywhere
there are woven feathers and serpents twine in and out.  Many Maya
inscriptions resemble a certain sort of elaborate drawing made by
lunatics in European asylums, more than any other old-world work.  It
is as if the Maya mind had developed upon a different line from the
old-world mind, had a different twist to its ideas, was not, by
old-world standards, a rational mind at all.

This linking of these aberrant American civilizations to the idea of a
general mental aberration finds support in their extraordinary
obsession by the shedding of human blood.  The Mexican civilization in
particular ran blood; it offered thousands of human victims yearly. 
The cutting open of living victims, the tearing out of the still
beating heart, was an act that dominated the minds and lives of these
strange priesthoods.  The public life, the national festivities all
turned on this fantastically horrible act.

The ordinary existence of the common people in these communities was
very like the ordinary existence of any other barbaric peasantry. 
Their pottery, weaving and dyeing was very good.  The Maya writing was
not only carven on stone but written and painted upon skins and the
like.  The European and American museums contain many enigmatical Maya
manuscripts of which at present little has been deciphered except the
dates.  In Peru there were beginnings of a similar writing but they
were superseded by a method of keeping records by knotting cords.  A
similar method of mnemonics was in use in China thousands of years ago.

In the old world before 4000 or 5000 B.C., that is to say three or four
thousand years earlier, there were primitive civilizations not unlike
these American civilizations; civilizations based upon a temple, having
a vast quantity of blood sacrifices and with an intensely astronomical
priesthood.  But in the old world the primitive civilizations reacted
upon one another and developed towards the conditions of our own world.
 In America these primitive civilizations never progressed beyond this
primitive stage.  Each of them was in a little world of its own. 
Mexico it seems knew little or nothing of Peru, until the Europeans
came to America.  The potato, which was the principal food stuff in
Peru, was unknown in Mexico.

Age by age these peoples lived and marvelled at their gods and made
their sacrifices and died.  Maya art rose to high levels of decorative
beauty.  Men made love and tribes made war.  Drought and plenty,
pestilence and health, followed one another.  The priests elaborated
their calendar and their sacrificial ritual through long centuries, but
made little progress in other directions.




XV
SUMERIA, EARLY EGYPT AND WRITING


The old world is a wider, more varied stage than the new. By 6000 or
7000 B.C. there were already quasi-civilized communities almost at the
Peruvian level, appearing in various fertile regions of Asia and in the
Nile valley. At that time north Persia and western Turkestan and south
Arabia were all more fertile than they are now, and there are traces of
very early communities in these regions. It is in lower Mesopotamia
however and in Egypt that there first appear cities, temples,
systematic irrigation, and evidences of a social organization rising
above the level of a mere barbaric village-town. In those days the
Euphrates and Tigris flowed by separate mouths into the Persian Gulf,
and it was in the country between them that the Sumerians built their
first cities. About the same time, for chronology is still vague, the
great history of Egypt was beginning.

These Sumerians appear to have been a brownish people with prominent
noses.  They employed a sort of writing that has been deciphered, and
their language is now known.  They had discovered the use of bronze and
they built great tower-like temples of sun-dried brick. The clay of
this country is very fine; they used it to write upon, and so it is
that their inscriptions have been preserved to us.  They had cattle,
sheep, goats and asses, but no horses.  They fought on foot, in close
formation, carrying spears and shields of skin. Their clothing was of
wool and they shaved their heads.

Each of the Sumerian cities seems generally to have been an independent
state with a god of its own and priests of its own.  But sometimes one
city would establish an ascendancy over others and exact tribute from
their population.  A very ancient inscription at Nippur records the
“empire,” the first recorded empire, of the Sumerian city of Erech. 
Its god and its priest-king claimed an authority from the Persian Gulf
to the Red Sea.

At first writing was merely an abbreviated method of pictorial record. 
Even before Neolithic times men were beginning to write.  The Azilian
rock pictures to which we have already referred show the beginning of
the process. Many of them record hunts and expeditions, and in most of
these the human figures are plainly drawn.  But in some the painter
would not bother with head and limbs; he just indicated men by a
vertical and one or two transverse strokes.  From this to a
conventional condensed picture writing was an easy transition.  In
Sumeria, where the writing was done on clay with a stick, the dabs of
the characters soon became unrecognizably unlike the things they stood
for, but in Egypt where men painted on walls and on strips of the
papyrus reed (the first paper) the likeness to the thing imitated
remained.  From the fact that the wooden styles used in Sumeria made
wedge-shaped marks, the Sumerian writing is called cuneiform (=
wedge-shaped).

An important step towards writing was made when pictures were used to
indicate not the thing represented but some similar thing.  In the
rebus dear to children of a suitable age, this is still done to-day. 
We draw a camp with tents and a bell, and the child is delighted to
guess that this is the Scotch name Campbell.  The Sumerian language was
a language made up of accumulated syllables rather like some
contemporary Amerindian languages, and it lent itself very readily to
this syllabic method of writing words expressing ideas that could not
be conveyed by pictures directly.  Egyptian writing underwent parallel
developments.  Later on, when foreign peoples with less distinctly
syllabled methods of speech were to learn and use these picture scripts
they were to make those further modifications and simplifications that
developed at last into alphabetical writing.  All the true alphabets of
the later world derived from a mixture of the Sumerian cuneiform and
the Egyptian hieroglyphic (priest writing).  Later in China there was
to develop a conventionalized picture writing, but in China it never
got to the alphabetical stage.

The invention of writing was of very great importance in the
development of human societies.  It put agreements, laws, commandments
on record.  It made the growth of states larger than the old city
states possible.  It made a continuous historical consciousness
possible.  The command of the priest or king and his seal could go far
beyond his sight and voice and could survive his death.  It is
interesting to note that in ancient Sumeria seals were greatly used.  A
king or a nobleman or a merchant would have his seal often very
artistically carved, and would impress it on any clay document he
wished to authorize.  So close had civilization got to printing six
thousand years ago.  Then the clay was dried hard and became permanent.
 For the reader must remember that in the land of Mesopotamia for
countless years, letters, records and accounts were all written on
comparatively indestructible tiles.  To that fact we owe a great wealth
of recovered knowledge.

Daily life in those first city lands of the old world must have been
very similar in both Egypt and Sumeria.  And except for the asses and
cattle in the streets it must have been not unlike the life in the Maya
cities of America three or four thousand years later.  Most of the
people in peace time were busy with irrigation and cultivation—except
on days of religious festivity. They had no money and no need for it. 
They managed their small occasional trades by barter.  The princes and
rulers who alone had more than a few possessions used gold and silver
bars and precious stones for any incidental act of trade.  The temple
dominated life; in Sumeria it was a great towering temple that went up
to a roof from which the stars were observed; in Egypt it was a massive
building with only a ground floor. In Sumeria the priest ruler was the
greatest, most splendid of beings.  In Egypt however there was one who
was raised above the priests; he was the living incarnation of the
chief god of the land, the Pharaoh, the god king.

There were few changes in the world in those days; men’s days were
sunny, toilsome and conventional.  Few strangers came into the land and
such as did fared uncomfortably.  The priest directed life according to
immemorial rules and watched the stars for seed time and marked the
omens of the sacrifices and interpreted the warnings of dreams.  Men
worked and loved and died, not unhappily, forgetful of the savage past
of their race and heedless of its future.  Sometimes the ruler was
benign. Such was Pepi II, who reigned in Egypt for ninety years.
Sometimes he was ambitious and took men’s sons to be soldiers and sent
them against neighbouring city states to war and plunder, or he made
them toil to build great buildings.  Such were Cheops and Chephren and
Mycerinus, who built those vast sepulchral piles, the pyramids at
Gizeh. The largest of these is 450 feet high and the weight of stone in
it is 4,883,000 tons.  All this was brought down the Nile in boats and
lugged into place chiefly by human muscle.  Its erection must have
exhausted Egypt more than a great war would have done.




XVI
PRIMITIVE NOMADIC PEOPLES


It was not only in Mesopotamia and the Nile Valley that men were
settling down to agriculture and the formation of city states in the
centuries between 6000 and 8000 B.C. Wherever there were possibilities
of irrigation and a steady all-the-year-round food supply men were
exchanging the uncertainties and hardships of hunting and wandering for
the routines of settlement. On the upper Tigris a people called the
Assyrians were founding cities; in the valleys of Asia Minor and on the
Mediterranean shores and islands, there were small communities growing
up to civilization. Possibly parallel developments of human life were
already going on in favourable regions of India, and China. In many
parts of Europe where there were lakes well stocked with fish, little
communities of men had long settled in dwellings built on piles over
the water, and were eking out agriculture by fishing and hunting. But
over much larger areas of the old world no such settlement was
possible. The land was too harsh, too thickly wooded or too arid, or
the seasons too uncertain for mankind, with only the implements and
science of that age to take root.

For settlement under the conditions of the primitive civilizations men
needed a constant water supply and warmth and sunshine.  Where these
needs were not satisfied, man could live as a transient, as a hunter
following his game, as a herdsman following the seasonal grass, but he
could not settle.  The transition from the hunting to the herding life
may have been very gradual.  From following herds of wild cattle or (in
Asia) wild horses, men may have come to an idea of property in them,
have learnt to pen them into valleys, have fought for them against
wolves, wild dogs and other predatory beasts.

So while the primitive civilizations of the cultivators were growing up
chiefly in the great river valleys, a different way of living, the
nomadic life, a life in constant movement to and fro from winter
pasture to summer pasture, was also growing up.  The nomadic peoples
were on the whole hardier than the agriculturalists; they were less
prolific and numerous, they had no permanent temples and no highly
organized priesthood; they had less gear; but the reader must not
suppose that theirs was necessarily a less highly developed way of
living on that account.  In many ways this free life was a fuller life
than that of the tillers of the soil.  The individual was more
self-reliant; less of a unit in a crowd.  The leader was more
important; the medicine man perhaps less so.

Moving over large stretches of country the nomad took a wider view of
life.  He touched on the confines of this settled land and that.  He
was used to the sight of strange faces.  He had to scheme and treat for
pasture with competing tribes.  He knew more of minerals than the folk
upon the plough lands because he went over mountain passes and into
rocky places.  He may have been a better metallurgist.  Possibly bronze
and much more probably iron smelting were nomadic discoveries.  Some of
the earliest implements of iron reduced from its ores have been found
in Central Europe far away from the early civilizations.

On the other hand the settled folk had their textiles and their pottery
and made many desirable things.  It was inevitable that as the two
sorts of life, the agricultural and the nomadic differentiated, a
certain amount of looting and trading should develop between the two. 
In Sumeria particularly which had deserts and seasonal country on
either hand it must have been usual to have the nomads camping close to
the cultivated fields, trading and stealing and perhaps tinkering, as
gipsies do to this day.  (But hens they would not steal, because the
domestic fowl—an Indian jungle fowl originally was not domesticated by
man until about 1000 B.C.)  They would bring precious stones and things
of metal and leather.  If they were hunters they would bring skins. 
They would get in exchange pottery and beads and glass, garments and
suchlike manufactured things.

From an ancient and curiously painted model in the British Museum


Three main regions and three main kinds of wandering and imperfectly
settled people there were in those remote days of the first
civilizations in Sumeria and early Egypt.  Away in the forests of
Europe were the blonde Nordic peoples, hunters and herdsmen, a lowly
race.  The primitive civilizations saw very little of this race before
1500 B.C.  Away on the steppes of eastern Asia various Mongolian
tribes, the Hunnish peoples, were domesticating the horse and
developing a very wide sweeping habit of seasonal movement between
their summer and winter camping places. Possibly the Nordic and Hunnish
peoples were still separated from one another by the swamps of Russia
and the greater Caspian Sea of that time.  For very much of Russia
there was swamp and lake.  In the deserts, which were growing more arid
now, of Syria and Arabia, tribes of a dark white or brownish people,
the Semitic tribes, were driving flocks of sheep and goats and asses
from pasture to pasture.  It was these Semitic shepherds and certain
more negroid people from southern Persia, the Elamites, who were the
first nomads to come into close contact with the early civilizations. 
They came as traders and as raiders.  Finally there arose leaders among
them with bolder imaginations, and they became conquerors.

This monarch, son of Sargon I, was a great architecht as well as a
famous conqueror.  Discovered in 1898 among the ruins of Susa, Persia


About 2750 B.C. a great Semitic leader, Sargon, had conquered the whole
Sumerian land and was master of all the world from the Persian Gulf to
the Mediterranean Sea.  He was an illiterate barbarian and his people,
the Akkadians, learnt the Sumerian writing and adopted the Sumerian
language as the speech of the officials and the learned.  The empire he
founded decayed after two centuries, and after one inundation of
Elamites a fresh Semitic people, the Amorites, by degrees established
their rule over Sumeria.  They made their capital in what had hitherto
been a small up-river town, Babylon, and their empire is called the
first Babylonian Empire.  It was consolidated by a great king called
Hammurabi (circa 2100 B.C.) who made the earliest code of laws yet
known to history.

The narrow valley of the Nile lies less open to nomadic invasion than
Mesopotamia, but about the time of Hammurabi occurred a successful
Semitic invasion of Egypt and a line of Pharaohs was set up, the Hyksos
or “shepherd kings,” which lasted for several centuries.  These Semitic
conquerors never assimilated themselves with the Egyptians; they were
always regarded with hostility as foreigners and barbarians; and they
were at last expelled by a popular uprising about 1600 B.C.

But the Semites had come into Sumeria for good and all, the two races
assimilated and the Babylonian Empire became Semitic in its language
and character.




XVII
THE FIRST SEAGOING PEOPLES


The earliest boats and ships must have come into use some twenty-five
or thirty thousand years ago. Man was probably paddling about on the
water with a log of wood or an inflated skin to assist him, at latest
in the beginnings of the Neolithic period. A basketwork boat covered
with skin and caulked was used in Egypt and Sumeria from the beginnings
of our knowledge. Such boats are still used there. They are used to
this day in Ireland and Wales and in Alaska; sealskin boats still make
the crossing of Behring Straits. The hollow log followed as tools
improved. The building of boats and then ships came in a natural
succession.

Perhaps the legend of Noah’s Ark preserves the memory of some early
exploit in shipbuilding, just as the story of the Flood, so widely
distributed among the peoples of the world, may be the tradition of the
flooding of the Mediterranean basin.

There were ships upon the Red Sea long before the pyramids were built,
and there were ships on the Mediterranean and Persian Gulf by 7000 B.C.
 Mostly these were the ships of fishermen, but some were already
trading and pirate ships—for knowing what we do of mankind we may guess
pretty safely that the first sailors plundered where they could and
traded where they had to do so.

The seas on which these first ships adventured were inland seas on
which the wind blew fitfully and which were often at a dead calm for
days together, so that sailing did not develop beyond an accessory use.
 It is only in the last four hundred years that the well-rigged,
ocean-going, sailing ship has developed.  The ships of the ancient
world were essentially rowing ships which hugged the shore and went
into harbour at the first sign of rough weather.  As ships grew into
big galleys they caused a demand for war captives as galley slaves.

We have already noted the appearance of the Semitic people as wanderers
and nomads in the region of Syria and Arabia, and how they conquered
Sumeria and set up first the Akkadian and then the first Babylonian
Empire.  In the west these same Semitic peoples were taking to the sea.
 They set up a string of harbour towns along the Eastern coast of the
Mediterranean, of which Tyre and Sidon were the chief; and by the time
of Hammurabi in Babylon, they had spread as traders, wanderers and
colonizers over the whole Mediterranean basin. These sea Semites were
called the Phœnicians, They settled largely in Spain, pushing back the
old Iberian Basque population and sending coasting expeditions through
the straits of Gibraltar; and they set up colonies upon the north coast
of Africa.  Of Carthage, one of these Phœnician cities, we shall have
much more to tell later.

But the Phœnicians were not the first people to have galleys in the
Mediterranean waters.  There was already a series of towns and cities
among the islands and coasts of that sea belonging to a race or races
apparently connected by blood and language with the Basques to the west
and the Berbers and Egyptians to the south, the Ægean peoples. These
peoples must not be confused with the Greeks, who come much later into
our story; they were pre-Greek, but they had cities in Greece and Asia
Minor; Mycenæ and Troy for example, and they had a great and prosperous
establishment at Cnossos in Crete.

It is only in the last half century that the industry of excavating
archæologists has brought the extent and civilization of the Ægean
peoples to our knowledge. Cnossos has been most thoroughly explored; it
was happily not succeeded by any city big enough to destroy its ruins,
and so it is our chief source of information about this once almost
forgotten civilization.

The history of Cnossos goes back as far as the history of Egypt; the
two countries were trading actively across the sea by 4000 B.C.  By
2500 B.C., that is between the time of Sargon I and Hammurabi, Cretan
civilization was at its zenith.

Cnossos was not so much a town as a great palace for the Cretan monarch
and his people.  It was not even fortified. It was only fortified later
as the Phœnicians grew strong, and as a new and more terrible breed of
pirates, the Greeks, came upon the sea from the north.

The monarch was called Minos, as the Egyptian monarch was called
Pharaoh; and he kept his state in a palace fitted with running water,
with bathrooms and the like conveniences such as we know of in no other
ancient remains.  There he held great festivals and shows.  There was
bull-fighting, singularly like the bull-fighting that still survives in
Spain; there was resemblance even in the costumes of the bull-fighters;
and there were gymnastic displays.  The women’s clothes were remarkably
modern in spirit; they wore corsets and flounced dresses.  The pottery,
the textile manufactures, the sculpture, painting, jewellery, ivory,
metal and inlay work of these Cretans was often astonishingly
beautiful.  And they had a system of writing, but that still remains to
be deciphered.

This happy and sunny and civilized life lasted for some score of
centuries.  About 2000 B.C. Cnossos and Babylon abounded in comfortable
and cultivated people who probably led very pleasant lives.  They had
shows and they had religious festivals, they had domestic slaves to
look after them and industrial slaves to make a profit for them.  Life
must have seemed very secure in Cnossos for such people, sunlit and
girdled by the blue sea.  Egypt of course must have appeared rather a
declining country in those days under the rule of her half-barbaric
shepherd kings, and if one took an interest in politics one must have
noticed how the Semitic people seemed to be getting everywhere, ruling
Egypt, ruling distant Babylon, building Nineveh on the upper Tigris,
sailing west to the Pillars of Hercules (the straits of Gibraltar) and
setting up their colonies on those distant coasts.

There were some active arid curious minds in Cnossos, because later on
the Greeks told legends of a certain skilful Cretan artificer, Dædalus,
who attempted to make some sort of flying machine, perhaps a glider,
which collapsed and fell into the sea.

It is interesting to note some of the differences as well as the
resemblances between the life of Cnossos and our own.  To a Cretan
gentleman of 2500 B.C. iron was a rare metal which fell out of the sky
and was curious rather than useful—for as yet only meteoric iron was
known, iron had not been obtained from its ores.  Compare that with our
modern state of affairs pervaded by iron everywhere.  The horse again
would be a quite legendary creature to our Cretan, a sort of super-ass
which lived in the bleak northern lands far away beyond the Black Sea.
Civilization for him dwelt chiefly in Ægean Greece and Asia Minor,
where Lydians and Carians and Trojans lived a life and probably spoke
languages like his own.  There were Phœnicians and Ægeans settled in
Spain and North Africa, but those were very remote regions to his
imagination.  Italy was still a desolate land covered with dense
forests; the brown-skinned Etruscans had not yet gone there from Asia
Minor.  And one day perhaps this Cretan gentleman went down to the
harbour and saw a captive who attracted his attention because he was
very fair-complexioned and had blue eyes.  Perhaps our Cretan tried to
talk to him and was answered in an unintelligible gibberish.  This
creature came from somewhere beyond the Black Sea and seemed to be an
altogether benighted savage.  But indeed he was an Aryan tribesman, of
a race and culture of which we shall soon have much to tell, and the
strange gibberish he spoke was to differentiate some day into Sanskrit,
Persian, Greek, Latin, German, English and most of the chief languages
of the world.

Such was Cnossos at its zenith, intelligent, enterprising, bright and
happy.  But about 1400 B.C. disaster came perhaps very suddenly upon
its prosperity.  The palace of Minos was destroyed, and its ruins have
never been rebuilt or inhabited from that day to this. We do not know
how this disaster occurred.  The excavators note what appears to be
scattered plunder and the marks of the fire.  But the traces of a very
destructive earthquake have also been found.  Nature alone may have
destroyed Cnossos, or the Greeks may have finished what the earthquake
began.




XVIII
EGYPT, BABYLON AND ASSYRIA


The Egyptians had never submitted very willingly to the rule of their
Semitic shepherd kings and about 1600 A.D. a vigorous patriotic
movement expelled these foreigners. Followed a new phase or revival for
Egypt, a period known to Egyptologists as the New Empire. Egypt, which
had not been closely consolidated before the Hyksos invasion, was now a
united country; and the phase of subjugation and insurrection left her
full of military spirit. The Pharaohs became aggressive conquerors.
They had now acquired the war horse and the war chariot, which the
Hyksos had brought to them. Under Thothmes III and Amenophis III Egypt
had extended her rule into Asia as far as the Euphrates.

We are entering now upon a thousand years of warfare between the once
quite separated civilizations of Mesopotamia and the Nile.  At first
Egypt was ascendant.  The great dynasties, the Seventeenth Dynasty,
which included Thothmes III and Amenophis III and IV and a great queen
Hatasu, and the Nineteenth, when Rameses II, supposed by some to have
been the Pharaoh of Moses, reigned for sixty-seven years, raised Egypt
to high levels of prosperity.  In between there were phases of
depression for Egypt, conquest by the Syrians and later conquest by the
Ethiopians from the South.  In Mesopotamia Babylon ruled, then the
Hittites and the Syrians of Damascus rose to a transitory predominance;
at one time the Syrians conquered Egypt; the fortunes of the Assyrians
of Nineveh ebbed and flowed; sometimes the city was a conquered city;
sometimes the Assyrians ruled in Babylon and assailed Egypt.  Our space
is too limited here to tell of the comings and goings of the armies of
the Egyptians and of the various Semitic powers of Asia Minor, Syria
and Mesopotamia.  They were armies now provided with vast droves of war
chariots, for the horse—still used only for war and glory—had spread by
this time into the old civilizations from Central Asia.

Great conquerors appear in the dim light of that distant time and pass,
Tushratta, King of Mitanni, who captured Nineveh, Tiglath Pileser I of
Assyria who conquered Babylon.  At last the Assyrians became the
greatest military power of the time. Tiglath Pileser III conquered
Babylon in 745 B.C. and founded what historians call the New Assyrian
Empire.  Iron had also come now into civilization out of the north; the
Hittites, the precursors of the Armenians, had it first and
communicated its use to the Assyrians, and an Assyrian usurper, Sargon
II, armed his troops with it.  Assyria became the first power to
expound the doctrine of blood and iron.  Sargon’s son Sennacherib led
an army to the borders of Egypt, and was defeated not by military
strength but by the plague. Sennacherib’s grandson Assurbanipal (who is
also known in history by his Greek name of Sardanapalus) did actually
conquer Egypt in 670 B.C.  But Egypt was already a conquered country
then under an Ethiopian dynasty.  Sardanapalus simply replaced one
conqueror by another.

If one had a series of political maps of this long period of history,
this interval of ten centuries, we should have Egypt expanding and
contracting like an amœba under a microscope, and we should see these
various Semitic states of the Babylonians, the Assyrians, the Hittites
and the Syrians coming and going, eating each other up and disgorging
each other again.  To the west of Asia Minor there would be little
Ægean states like Lydia, whose capital was Sardis, and Caria.  But
after about 1200 B.C. and perhaps earlier, a new set of names would
come into the map of the ancient world from the north-east and from the
north- west.  These would be the names of certain barbaric tribes,
armed with iron weapons and using horse-chariots, who were becoming a
great affliction to the Ægean and Semitic civilizations on the northern
borders.  They all spoke variants of what once must have been the same
language, Aryan.

Round the north-east of the Black and Caspian Seas were coming the
Medes and Persians.  Confused with these in the records of the time
were Scythians and Samatians.  From north-east or north-west came the
Armenians, from the north- west of the sea-barrier through the Balkan
peninsula came Cimmerians, Phrygians and the Hellenic tribes whom now
we call the Greeks.  They were raiders and robbers and plunderers of
cities, these Ayrans, east and west alike. They were all kindred and
similar peoples, hardy herdsmen who had taken to plunder.  In the east
they were still only borderers and raiders, but in the west they were
taking cities and driving out the civilized Ægean populations. The
Ægean peoples were so pressed that they were seeking new homes in lands
beyond the Aryan range.  Some were seeking a settlement in the delta of
the Nile and being repulsed by the Egyptians; some, the Etruscans, seem
to have sailed from Asia Minor to found a state in the forest
wildernesses of middle Italy; some built themselves cities upon the
south- east coasts of the Mediterranean and became later that people
known in history as the Philistines.

Of these Aryans who came thus rudely upon the scene of the ancient
civilizations we will tell more fully in a later section.  Here we note
simply all this stir and emigration amidst the area of the ancient
civilizations, that was set up by the swirl of the gradual and
continuous advance of these Aryan barbarians out of the northern
forests and wildernesses between 1600 and 600 B.C.

And in a section to follow we must tell also of a little Semitic
people, the Hebrews, in the hills behind the Phœnician and Philistine
coasts, who began to be of significance in the world towards the end of
this period. They produced a literature of very great importance in
subsequent history, a collection of books, histories, poems, books of
wisdom and prophetic works, the Hebrew Bible.

In Mesopotamia and Egypt the coming of the Aryans did not cause
fundamental changes until after 600 B.C.  The flight of the Ægeans
before the Greeks and even the destruction of Cnossos must have seemed
a very remote disturbance to both the citizens of Egypt and of Babylon.
 Dynasties came and went in these cradle states of civilization, but
the main tenor of human life went on, with a slow increase in
refinement and complexity age by age.  In Egypt the accumulated
monuments of more ancient times—the pyramids were already in their
third thousand of years and a show for visitors just as they are to-
day—were supplemented by fresh and splendid buildings, more
particularly in the time of the seventeenth and nineteenth dynasties. 
The great temples at Karnak and Luxor date from this time.  All the
chief monuments of Nineveh, the great temples, the winged bulls with
human heads, the reliefs of kings and chariots and lion hunts, were
done in these centuries between 1600 and 600 B.C., and this period also
covers most of the splendours of Babylon.

Both from Mesopotamia and Egypt we now have abundant public records,
business accounts, stories, poetry and private correspondence.  We know
that life, for prosperous and influential people in such cities as
Babylon and the Egyptian Thebes, was already almost as refined and as
luxurious as that of comfortable and prosperous people to-day.  Such
people lived an orderly and ceremonious life in beautiful and
beautifully furnished and decorated houses, wore richly decorated
clothing and lovely jewels; they had feasts and festivals, entertained
one another with music and dancing, were waited upon by highly trained
servants, were cared for by doctors and dentists.  They did not travel
very much or very far, but boating excursions were a common summer
pleasure both on the Nile and on the Euphrates.  The beast of burthen
was the ass; the horse was still used only in chariots for war and upon
occasions of state.  The mule was still novel and the camel, though it
was known in Mesopotamia, had not been brought into Egypt.  And there
were few utensils of iron; copper and bronze remained the prevailing
metals.  Fine linen and cotton fabrics were known as well as wool.  But
there was no silk yet.  Glass was known and beautifully coloured, but
glass things were usually small.  There was no clear glass and no
optical use of glass. People had gold stoppings in their teeth but no
spectacles on their noses.

One odd contrast between the life of old Thebes or Babylon and modern
life was the absence of coined money.  Most trade was still done by
barter.  Babylon was financially far ahead of Egypt.  Gold and silver
were used for exchange and kept in ingots; and there were bankers,
before coinage, who stamped their names and the weight on these lumps
of precious metal. A merchant or traveller would carry precious stones
to sell to pay for his necessities.  Most servants and workers were
slaves who were paid not money but in kind.  As money came in slavery
declined.

A modern visitor to these crowning cities of the ancient world would
have missed two very important articles of diet; there were no hens and
no eggs.  A French cook would have found small joy in Babylon.  These
things came from the East somewhere about the time of the last Assyrian
empire.

Religion like everything else had undergone great refinement. Human
sacrifice for instance had long since disappeared; animals or bread
dummies had been substituted for the victim. (But the Phœnicians and
especially the citizens of Carthage, their greatest settlement in
Africa, were accused, later of immolating human beings.)  When a great
chief had died in the ancient days it had been customary to sacrifice
his wives and slaves and break spear and bow at his tomb so that he
should not go unattended and unarmed in the spirit world.  In Egypt
there survived of this dark tradition the pleasant custom of burying
small models of house and shop and servants and cattle with the dead,
models that give us to-day the liveliest realization of the safe and
cultivated life of these ancient people, three thousand years and more
ago.

Such was the ancient world before the coming of the Aryans out of the
northern forests and plains.  In India and China there were parallel
developments.  In the great valleys of both these regions agricultural
city states of brownish peoples were growing up, but in India they do
not seem to have advanced or coalesced so rapidly as the city states of
Mesopotamia or Egypt.  They were nearer the level of the ancient
Sumerians or of the Maya civilization of America.  Chinese history has
still to be modernized by Chinese scholars and cleared of much
legendary matter.  Probably China at this time was in advance of India.
 Contemporary with the seventeenth dynasty in Egypt, there was a
dynasty of emperors in China, the Shang dynasty, priest emperors over a
loose-knit empire of subordinate kings.  The chief duty of these early
emperors was to perform the seasonal sacrifices.  Beautiful bronze
vessels from the time of the Shang dynasty still exist, and their
beauty and workmanship compel us to recognize that many centuries of
civilization must have preceded their manufacture.




XIX
THE PRIMITIVE ARYANS


Four thousand years ago, that is to say about 2000 B.C., central and
south-eastern Europe and central Asia were probably warmer, moister and
better wooded than they are now. In these regions of the earth wandered
a group of tribes mainly of the fair and blue-eyed Nordic race,
sufficiently in touch with one another to speak merely variations of
one common language from the Rhine to the Caspian Sea. At that time
they may not have been a very numerous people, and their existence was
unsuspected by the Babylonians to whom Hammurabi was giving laws, or by
the already ancient and cultivated land of Egypt which was tasting in
those days for the first time the bitterness of foreign conquest.

These Nordic people were destined to play a very important part indeed
in the world’s history.  They were a people of the parklands and the
forest clearings; they had no horses at first but they had cattle; when
they wandered they put their tents and other gear on rough ox waggons;
when they settled for a time they may have made huts of wattle and mud.
They burnt their important dead; they did not bury them ceremoniously
as the brunette peoples did.  They put the ashes of their greater
leaders in urns and then made a great circular mound about them.  These
mounds are the “round barrows” that occur all over north Europe.  The
brunette people, their predecessors, did not burn their dead but buried
them in a sitting position in elongated mounds; the “long barrows.”

The Aryans raised crops of wheat, ploughing with oxen, but they did not
settle down by their crops; they would reap and move on.  They had
bronze, and somewhen about 1500 B.C. they acquired iron.  They may have
been the discoverers of iron smelting.  And somewhen vaguely about that
time they also got the horse—which to begin with they used only for
draught purposes.  Their social life did not centre upon a temple like
that of the more settled people round the Mediterranean, and their
chief men were leaders rather than priests.  They had an aristocratic
social order rather than a divine and regal order; from a very early
stage they distinguished certain families as leaderly and noble.

They were a very vocal people.  They enlivened their wanderings by
feasts, at which there was much drunkenness and at which a special sort
of man, the bards, would sing and recite.  They had no writing until
they had come into contact with civilization, and the memories of these
bards were their living literature.  This use of recited language as an
entertainment did much to make it a fine and beautiful instrument of
expression, and to that no doubt the subsequent predominance of the
languages derived from Aryan is, in part, to be ascribed.  Every Aryan
people had its legendary history crystallized in bardic recitations,
epics, sagas and vedas, as they were variously called.

The social life of these people centred about the households of their
leading men.  The hall of the chief where they settled for a time was
often a very capacious timber building.  There were no doubt huts for
herds and outlying farm buildings; but with most of the Aryan peoples
this hall was the general centre, everyone went there to feast and hear
the bards and take part in games and discussions.  Cowsheds and
stabling surrounded it.  The chief and his wife and so forth would
sleep on a dais or in an upper gallery; the commoner sort slept about
anywhere, as people still do in Indian households.  Except for weapons,
ornaments, tools and suchlike personal possessions there was a sort of
patriarchal communism in the tribe.  The chief owned the cattle and
grazing lands in the common interest; forest and rivers were the wild.

This was the fashion of the people who were increasing and multiplying
over the great spaces of central Europe and west central Asia during
the growth of the great civilization of Mesopotamia and the Nile, and
whom we find pressing upon the heliolithic peoples everywhere in the
second millennium before Christ.  They were coming into France and
Britain and into Spain.  They pushed westward in two waves.  The first
of these people who reached Britain and Ireland were armed with bronze
weapons.  They exterminated or subjugated the people who had made the
great stone monuments of Carnac in Brittany and Stonehenge and Avebury
in England.  They reached Ireland. They are called the Goidelic Celts.
The second wave of a closely kindred people, perhaps intermixed with
other racial elements, brought iron with it into Great Britain, and is
known as the wave of Brythonic Celts.  From them the Welsh derive their
language.

Kindred Celtic peoples were pressing southward into Spain and coming
into contact not only with the heliolithic Basque people who still
occupied the country but with the Semitic Phœnician colonies of the sea
coast.  A closely allied series of tribes, the Italians, were making
their way down the still wild and wooded Italian peninsula.  They did
not always conquer.  In the eighth century B.C.  Rome appears in
history, a trading town on the Tiber, inhabited by Aryan Latins but
under the rule of Etruscan nobles and kings.

At the other extremity of the Aryan range there was a similar progress
southward of similar tribes.  Aryan peoples, speaking Sanskrit, had
come down through the western passes into North India long before 1000
B.C.  There they came into contact with a primordial brunette
civilization, the Dravidian civilization, and learnt much from it. 
Other Aryan tribes seem to have spread over the mountain masses of
Central Asia far to the east of the present range of such peoples.  In
Eastern Turkestan there are still fair, blue-eyed Nordic tribes, but
now they speak Mongolian tongues.

Between the Black and Caspian Seas the ancient Hittites had been
submerged and “Aryanized” by the Armenians before 1000 B.C., and the
Assyrians and Babylonians were already aware of a new and formidable
fighting barbarism on the north-eastern frontiers, a group of tribes
amidst which the Scythians, the Medes and the Persians remain as
outstanding names.

But it was through the Balkan peninsula that Aryan tribes made their
first heavy thrust into the heart of the old-world civilization.  They
were already coming southward and crossing into Asia Minor many
centuries before 1000 B.C.  First came a group of tribes of whom the
Phrygians were the most conspicuous, and then in succession the Æolic,
the Ionic and the Dorian Greeks. By 1000 B.C. they had wiped out the
ancient Ægean civilization both in the mainland of Greece and in most
of the Greek islands; the cities of Mycenæ and Tiryns were obliterated
and Cnossos was nearly forgotten.  The Greeks had taken to the sea
before 1000 A.D., they had settled in Crete and Rhodes, and they were
founding colonies in Sicily and the south of Italy after the fashion of
the Phœnician trading cities that were dotted along the Mediterranean
coasts.

So it was, while Tiglath Pileser III and Sargon II and Sardanapalus
were ruling in Assyria and fighting with Babylonia and Syria and Egypt,
the Aryan peoples were learning the methods of civilization and making
it over for their own purposes in Italy and Greece and north Persia. 
The theme of history from the ninth century B.C. A.D. onward for six
centuries is the story of how these Aryan peoples grew to power and
enterprise and how at last they subjugated the whole Ancient World,
Semitic, Ægean and Egyptian alike.  In form the Aryan peoples were
altogether victorious; but the struggle of Aryan, Semitic and Egyptian
ideas and methods was continued long after the sceptre was in Aryan
hands.  It is indeed a struggle that goes on through all the rest of
history and still in a manner continues to this day.




XX
THE LAST BABYLONIAN EMPIRE AND THE EMPIRE OF DARIUS I


We have already mentioned how Assyria became a great military power
under Tiglath Pileser III and under the usurper Sargon II. Sargon was
not this man’s original name; he adopted it to flatter the conquered
Babylonians by reminding them of that ancient founder of the Akkadian
Empire, Sargon I, two thousand years before his time. Babylon, for all
that it was a conquered city, was of greater population and importance
than Nineveh, and its great god Bel Marduk and its traders and priests
had to be treated politely. In Mesopotamia in the eighth century B.C.
A.D. we are already far beyond the barbaric days when the capture of a
town meant loot and massacre. Conquerors sought to propitiate and win
the conquered. For a century and a half after Sargon the new Assyrian
empire endured and, as we have noted, Assurbanipal (Sardanapalus) held
at least lower Egypt.

But the power and solidarity of Assyria waned rapidly.  Egypt by an
effort threw off the foreigner under a Pharoah Psammetichus I, and
under Necho II attempted a war of conquest in Syria.  By that time
Assyria was grappling with foes nearer at hand, and could make but a
poor resistance.  A Semitic people from south-east Mesopotamia, the
Chaldeans, combined with Aryan Medes and Persians from the north-east
against Nineveh, and in 606 B.C.—for now we are coming down to exact
chronology—took that city.

There was a division of the spoils of Assyria.  A Median Empire was set
up in the north under Cyaxares.   It included Nineveh, and its capital
was Ecbatana.  Eastward it reached to the borders of India.  To the
south of this in a great crescent was a new Chaldean Empire, the Second
Babylonian Empire, which rose to a very great degree of wealth and
power under the rule of Nebuchadnezzar the Great (the Nebuchadnezzar of
the Bible). The last great days, the greatest days of all, for Babylon
began.  For a time the two Empires remained at peace, and the daughter
of Nebuchadnezzar was married to Cyaxares.

Meanwhile Necho II was pursuing his easy conquests in Syria. He had
defeated and slain King Josiah of Judah, a small country of which there
is more to tell presently, at the battle of Megiddo in 608 B.C., and he
pushed on to the Euphrates to encounter not a decadent Assyria but a
renascent Babylonia.  The Chaldeans dealt very vigorously with the
Egyptians.  Necho was routed and driven back to Egypt, and the
Babylonian frontier pushed down to the ancient Egyptian boundaries.

Empires in the reign of Nebuchadnezzar the Great

From 606 until 589 B.C. the Second Babylonian Empire flourished
insecurely.  It flourished so long as it kept the peace with the
stronger, hardier Median Empire to the north.  And during these
sixty-seven years not only life but learning flourished in the ancient
city.

extent

Even under the Assyrian monarchs and especially under Sardanapalus,
Babylon had been a scene of great intellectual activity.  Sardanapalus,
though an Assyrian, had been quite Babylon-ized.  He made a library, a
library not of paper but of the clay tablets that were used for writing
in Mesopotamia since early Sumerian days.  His collection has been
unearthed and is perhaps the most precious store of historical material
in the world.  The last of the Chaldean line of Babylonian monarchs,
Nabonidus, had even keener literary tastes.  He patronized antiquarian
researches, and when a date was worked out by his investigators for the
accession of Sargon I he commemorated the fact by inscriptions.  But
there were many signs of disunion in his empire, and he sought to
centralize it by bringing a number of the various local gods to Babylon
and setting up temples to them there.  This device was to be practised
quite successfully by the Romans in later times, but in Babylon it
roused the jealousy of the powerful priesthood of Bel Marduk, the
dominant god of the Babylonians.  They cast about for a possible
alternative to Nabonidus and found it in Cyrus the Persian, the ruler
of the adjacent Median Empire.  Cyrus had already distinguished himself
by conquering Croesus, the rich king of Lydia in Eastern Asia Minor. 
He came up against Babylon, there was a battle outside the walls, and
the gates of the city were opened to him (538 B.C.).  His soldiers
entered the city without fighting.  The crown prince Belshazzar, the
son of Nabonidus, was feasting, the Bible relates, when a hand appeared
and wrote in letters of fire upon the wall these mystical words: 
_“Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin,”_ which was interpreted by the prophet
Daniel, whom he summoned to read the riddle, as “God has numbered thy
kingdom and finished it; thou art weighed in the balance and found
wanting and thy kingdom is given to the Medes and Persians.”  Possibly
the priests of Bel Marduk knew something about that writing on the
wall. Belshazzar was killed that night, says the Bible.  Nabonidus was
taken prisoner, and the occupation of the city was so peaceful that the
services of Bel Marduk continued without intermission.

Thus it was the Babylonian and Median empires were united. Cambyses,
the son of Cyrus, subjugated Egypt.  Cambyses went mad and was
accidentally killed, and was presently succeeded by Darius the Mede,
Darius I, the son of Hystaspes, one of the chief councillors of Cyrus.

The Persian Empire of Darius I, the first of the new Aryan empires in
the seat of the old civilizations, was the greatest empire the world
had hitherto seen.  It included all Asia Minor and Syria, all the old
Assyrian and Babylonian empires, Egypt, the Caucasus and Caspian
regions, Media, Persia, and it extended into India as far as the Indus.
 Such an empire was possible because the horse and rider and the
chariot and the made-road had now been brought into the world. 
Hitherto the ass and ox and the camel for desert use had afforded the
swiftest method of transport.  Great arterial roads were made by the
Persian rulers to hold their new empire, and post horses were always in
waiting for the imperial messenger or the traveller with an official
permit.  Moreover the world was now beginning to use coined money,
which greatly facilitated trade and intercourse.  But the capital of
this vast empire was no longer Babylon.  In the long run the priesthood
of Bel Marduk gained nothing by their treason. Babylon though still
important was now a declining city, and the great cities of the new
empire were Persepolis and Susa and Ecbatana.  The capital was Susa. 
Nineveh was already abandoned and sinking into ruins.




XXI
THE EARLY HISTORY OF THE JEWS


And now we can tell of the Hebrews, a Semitic people, not so important
in their own time as in their influence upon the later history of the
world. They were settled in Judea long before 1000 B.C., and their
capital city after that time was Jerusalem. Their story is interwoven
with that of the great empires on either side of them, Egypt to the
south and the changing empires of Syria, Assyria and Babylon to the
north. Their country was an inevitable high road between these latter
powers and Egypt.

Their importance in the world is due to the fact that they produced a
written literature, a world history, a collection of laws, chronicles,
psalms, books of wisdom, poetry and fiction and political utterances
which became at last what Christians know as the Old Testament, the
Hebrew Bible.  This literature appears in history in the fourth or
fifth century B.C.

Probably this literature was first put together in Babylon. We have
already told how the Pharaoh, Necho II, invaded the Assyrian Empire
while Assyria was fighting for life against Medes, Persians and
Chaldeans.  Josiah King of Judah opposed him, and was defeated and
slain at Megiddo (608 B.C.).  Judah became a tributary to Egypt, and
when Nebuchadnezzar the Great, the new Chaldean king in Babylon, rolled
back Necho into Egypt, he attempted to manage Judah by setting up
puppet kings in Jerusalem.  The experiment failed, the people massacred
his Babylonian officials, and he then determined to break up this
little state altogether, which had long been playing off Egypt against
the northern empire.  Jerusalem was sacked and burnt, and the remnant
of the people was carried off captive to Babylon.

There they remained until Cyrus took Babylon (538 B.C.).  He then
collected them together and sent them back to resettle their country
and rebuild the walls and temple of Jerusalem.

Before that time the Jews do not seem to have been a very civilized or
united people.  Probably only a very few of them could read or write. 
In their own history one never hears of the early books of the Bible
being read; the first mention of a book is in the time of Josiah.  The
Babylonian captivity civilized them and consolidated them.  They
returned aware of their own literature, an acutely self-conscious and
political people.

Their Bible at that time seems to have consisted only of the
Pentateuch, that is to say the first five books of the Old Testament as
we know it.  In addition, as separate books they already had many of
the other books that have since been incorporated with the Pentateuch
into the present Hebrew Bible, Chronicles, the Psalms and Proverbs for
example.

The accounts of the Creation of the World, of Adam and Eve and of the
Flood, with which the Bible begins, run closely parallel with similar
Babylonian legends; they seem to have been part of the common beliefs
of all the Semitic peoples. So too the stories of Moses and of Samson
have Sumerian and Babylonian parallels.  But with the story of Abraham
and onward begins something more special to the Jewish race.

Abraham may have lived as early as the days of Hammurabi in Babylon. 
He was a patriarchal Semitic nomad.  To the book of Genesis the reader
must go for the story of his wanderings and for the stories of his sons
and grandchildren and how they became captive in the Land of Egypt.  He
travelled through Canaan, and the God of Abraham, says the Bible story,
promised this smiling land of prosperous cities to him and to his
children.

And after a long sojourn in Egypt and after fifty years of wandering in
the wilderness under the leadership of Moses, the children of Abraham,
grown now to a host of twelve tribes, invaded the land of Canaan from
the Arabian deserts to the East.  They may have done this somewhen
between 1600 B.C. and 1300 B.C.; there are no Egyptian records of Moses
nor of Canaan at this time to help out the story.  But at any rate they
did not succeed in conquering any more than the hilly backgrounds of
the promised land.  The coast was now in the hands, not of the
Canaanites but of newcomers, those Ægean peoples, the Philistines; and
their cities, Gaza, Gath, Ashdod, Ascalon and Joppa successfully
withstood the Hebrew attack.  For many generations the children of
Abraham remained an obscure people of the hilly back country engaged in
incessant bickerings with the Philistines and with the kindred tribes
about them, the Moabites, the Midianites and so forth.  The reader will
find in the book of Judges a record of their struggles and disasters
during this period. For very largely it is a record of disasters and
failures frankly told.


Map: The Land of the Hebrews

For most of this period the Hebrews were ruled, so far as there was any
rule among them, by priestly judges selected by the elders of the
people, but at last somewhen towards 1000 B.C. they chose themselves a
king, Saul, to lead them in battle.  But Saul’s leading was no great
improvement upon the leading of the Judges; he perished under the hail
of Philistine arrows at the battle of Mount Gilboa, his armour went
into the temple of the Philistine Venus, and his body was nailed to the
walls of Beth-shan.

His successor David was more successful and more politic. With David
dawned the only period of prosperity the Hebrew peoples were ever to
know.  It was based on a close alliance with the Phœnician city of
Tyre, whose King Hiram seems to have been a man of very great
intelligence and enterprise. He wished to secure a trade route to the
Red Sea through the Hebrew hill country.  Normally Phœnician trade went
to the Red Sea by Egypt, but Egypt was in a state of profound disorder
at this time; there may have been other obstructions to Phœnician trade
along this line, and at any rate Hiram established the very closest
relations both with David and with his son and successor Solomon. 
Under Hiram’s auspices the walls, palace and temple of Jerusalem arose,
and in return Hiram built and launched his ships on the Red Sea.  A
very considerable trade passed northward and southward through
Jerusalem.  And Solomon achieved a prosperity and magnificence
unprecedented in the experience of his people.  He was even given a
daughter of Pharaoh in marriage.

But it is well to keep the proportion of things in mind.  At the climax
of his glories Solomon was only a little subordinate king in a little
city.  His power was so transitory that within a few years of his
death, Shishak the first Pharaoh of the twenty-second dynasty, had
taken Jerusalem and looted most of its splendours.  The account of
Solomon’s magnificence given in the books of Kings and Chronicles is
questioned by many critics.  They say that it was added to and
exaggerated by the patriotic pride of later writers.  But the Bible
account read carefully is not so overwhelming as it appears at the
first reading. Solomon’s temple, if one works out the measurements,
would go inside a small suburban church, and his fourteen hundred
chariots cease to impress us when we learn from an Assyrian monument
that his successor Ahab sent a contingent of two thousand to the
Assyrian army.  It is also plainly manifest from the Bible narrative
that Solomon spent himself in display and overtaxed and overworked his
people.  At his death the northern part of his kingdom broke off from
Jerusalem and became the independent kingdom of Israel. Jerusalem
remained the capital city of Judah.

The prosperity of the Hebrew people was short-lived.  Hiram died, and
the help of Tyre ceased to strengthen Jerusalem. Egypt grew strong
again.  The history of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah
becomes a history of two little states ground between, first, Syria,
then Assyria and then Babylon to the north and Egypt to the south.  It
is a tale of disasters and of deliverances that only delayed disaster. 
It is a tale of barbaric kings ruling a barbaric people. In 721 B.C.
the kingdom of Israel was swept away into captivity by the Assyrians
and its people utterly lost to history.  Judah struggled on until in
604 B.C., as we have told, it shared the fate of Israel.  There may be
details open to criticism in the Bible story of Hebrew history from the
days of the Judges onward, but on the whole it is evidently a true
story which squares with all that has been learnt in the excavation of
Egypt and Assyria and Babylon during the past century.

It was in Babylon that the Hebrew people got their history together and
evolved their tradition.  The people who came back to Jerusalem at the
command of Cyrus were a very different people in spirit and knowledge
from those who had gone into captivity.  They had learnt civilization. 
In the development of their peculiar character a very great part was
played by certain men, a new sort of men, the Prophets, to whom we must
now direct our attention.  These Prophets mark the appearance of new
and remarkable forces in the steady development of human society.




XXII
PRIESTS AND PROPHETS IN JUDEA


The fall of Assyria and Babylon were only the first of a series of
disasters that were to happen to the Semitic peoples. In the seventh
century B.C. it would have seemed as though the whole civilized world
was to be dominated by Semitic rulers. They ruled the great Assyrian
empire and they had conquered Egypt; Assyria, Babylon, Syria were all
Semitic, speaking languages that were mutually intelligible. The trade
of the world was in Semitic hands. Tyre, Sidon, the great mother cities
of the Phœnician coast, had thrown out colonies that grew at last to
even greater proportion in Spain, Sicily and Africa. Carthage, founded
before 800 B.C., had risen to a population of more than a million. It
was for a time the greatest city on earth. Its ships went to Britain
and out into the Atlantic. They may have reached Madeira. We have
already noted how Hiram co-operated with Solomon to build ships on the
Red Sea for the Arabian and perhaps for the Indian trade. In the time
of the Pharaoh Necho, a Phœnician expedition sailed completely round
Africa.

At that time the Aryan peoples were still barbarians.  Only the Greeks
were reconstructing a new civilization of the ruins of the one they had
destroyed, and the Medes were becoming “formidable,” as an Assyrian
inscription calls them, in central Asia.  In 800 B.C. no one could have
prophesied that before the third century B.C. every trace of Semitic
dominion would be wiped out by Aryan-speaking conquerors, and that
everywhere the Semitic peoples would be subjects or tributaries or
scattered altogether.  Everywhere except in the northern deserts of
Arabia, where the Bedouin adhered steadily to the nomadic way of life,
the ancient way of life of the Semites before Sargon I and his
Akkadians went down to conquer Sumeria.  But the Arab Bedouin were
never conquered by Aryan masters.

Now of all these civilized Semites who were beaten and overrun in these
five eventful centuries one people only held together and clung to its
ancient traditions and that was this little people, the Jews, who were
sent back to build their city of Jerusalem by Cyrus the Persian.  And
they were able to do this, because they had got together this
literature of theirs, their Bible, in Babylon.  It is not so much the
Jews who made the Bible as the Bible which made the Jews.  Running
through this Bible were certain ideas, different from the ideas of the
people about them, very stimulating and sustaining ideas, to which they
were destined to cling through five and twenty centuries of hardship,
adventure and oppression.

Foremost of these Jewish ideas was this, that their God was invisible
and remote, an invisible God in a temple not made with hands, a Lord of
Righteousness throughout the earth. All other peoples had national gods
embodied in images that lived in temples.  If the image was smashed and
the temple razed, presently that god died out.  But this was a new
idea, this God of the Jews, in the heavens, high above priests and
sacrifices.  And this God of Abraham, the Jews believed, had chosen
them to be his peculiar people, to restore Jerusalem and make it the
capital of Righteousness in the World.  They were a people exalted by
their sense of a common destiny. This belief saturated them all when
they returned to Jerusalem after the captivity in Babylon.

Is it any miracle that in their days of overthrow and subjugation many
Babylonians and Syrians and so forth and later on many Phœnicians,
speaking practically the same language and having endless customs,
habits, tastes and traditions in common, should be attracted by this
inspiring cult and should seek to share in its fellowship and its
promise?  After the fall of Tyre, Sidon, Carthage and the Spanish
Phœnician cities, the Phœnicians suddenly vanish from history; and as
suddenly we find, not simply in Jerusalem but in Spain, Africa, Egypt,
Arabia, the East, wherever the Phœnicians had set their feet,
communities of Jews.  And they were all held together by the Bible and
by the reading of the Bible.  Jerusalem was from the first only their
nominal capital; their real city was this book of books.  This is a new
sort of thing in history.  It is something of which the seeds were sown
long before, when the Sumerians and Egyptians began to turn their
hieroglyphics into writing.  The Jews were a new thing, a people
without a king and presently without a temple (for as we shall tell
Jerusalem itself was broken up in 70 A.D.), held together and
consolidated out of heterogeneous elements by nothing but the power of
the written word.

And this mental welding of the Jews was neither planned nor foreseen
nor done by either priests or statesmen.  Not only a new kind of
community but a new kind of man comes into history with the development
of the Jews.  In the days of Solomon the Hebrews looked like becoming a
little people just like any other little people of that time clustering
around court and temple, ruled by the wisdom of the priest and led by
the ambition of the king.  But already, the reader may learn from the
Bible, this new sort of man of which we speak, the Prophet, was in
evidence.

As troubles thicken round the divided Hebrews the importance of these
Prophets increases.

What were these Prophets?  They were men of the most diverse origins. 
The Prophet Ezekiel was of the priestly caste and the Prophet Amos wore
the goatskin mantle of a shepherd, but all had this in common, that
they gave allegiance to no one but to the God of Righteousness and that
they spoke directly to the people.  They came without licence or
consecration.  “Now the word of the Lord came unto me;” that was the
formula.  They were intensely political.  They exhorted the people
against Egypt, “that broken reed,” or against Assyria or Babylon; they
denounced the indolence of the priestly order or the flagrant sins of
the King.  Some of them turned their attention to what we should now
call “social reform.”  The rich were “grinding the faces of the poor,”
the luxurious were consuming the children’s bread; wealthy people made
friends with and imitated the splendours and vices of foreigners; and
this was hateful to Jehovah, the God of Abraham, who would certainly
punish this land.

These fulminations were written down and preserved and studied.  They
went wherever the Jews went, and wherever they went they spread a new
religious spirit.  They carried the common man past priest and temple,
past court and king and brought him face to face with the Rule of
Righteousness. That is their supreme importance in the history of
mankind. In the great utterances of Isaiah the prophetic voice rises to
a pitch of splendid anticipation and foreshadows the whole earth united
and at peace under one God.  Therein the Jewish prophecies culminate.

All the Prophets did not speak in this fashion, and the intelligent
reader of the prophetic books will find much hate in them, much
prejudice, and much that will remind him of the propaganda pamphlets of
the present time.  Nevertheless it is the Hebrew Prophets of the period
round and about the Babylonian captivity who mark the appearance of a
new power in the world, the power of individual moral appeal, of an
appeal to the free conscience of mankind against the fetish sacrifices
and slavish loyalties that had hitherto bridled and harnessed our race.




XXIII
THE GREEKS


Now while after Solomon (whose reign was probably about 960 B.C.) the
divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah were suffering destruction and
deportation, and while the Jewish people were developing their
tradition in captivity in Babylon, another great power over the human
mind, the Greek tradition, was also arising. While the Hebrew prophets
were working out a new sense of direct moral responsibility between the
people and an eternal and universal God of Right, the Greek
philosophers were training the human mind in a new method and spirit of
intellectual adventure.

The Greek tribes as we have told were a branch of the Aryan- speaking
stem. They had come down among the Ægean cities and islands some
centuries before 1000 B.C.  They were probably already in southward
movement before the Pharaoh Thothmes hunted his first elephants beyond
the conquered Euphrates.  For in those days there were elephants in
Mesopotamia and lions in Greece.

It is possible that it was a Greek raid that burnt Cnossos, but there
are no Greek legends of such a victory though there are stories of
Minos and his palace (the Labyrinth) and of the skill of the Cretan
artificers.

Like most of the Aryans these Greeks had singers and reciters whose
performances were an important social link, and these handed down from
the barbaric beginnings of their people two great epics, the _Iliad_,
telling how a league of Greek tribes besieged and took and sacked the
town of Troy in Asia Minor, and the _Odyssey_, being a long adventure
story of the return of the sage captain, Odysseus, from Troy to his own
island.  These epics were written down somewhen in the eighth or
seventh century B.C., when the Greeks had acquired the use of an
alphabet from their more civilized neighbours, but they are supposed to
have been in existence very much earlier.  Formerly they were ascribed
to a particular blind bard, Homer, who was supposed to have sat down
and composed them as Milton composed Paradise Lost. Whether there
really was such a poet, whether he composed or only wrote down and
polished these epics and so forth, is a favourite quarrelling ground
for the erudite.  We need not concern ourselves with such bickerings
here.  The thing that matters from our point of view is that the Greeks
were in possession of their epics in the eighth century B.C., and that
they were a common possession and a link between their various tribes,
giving them a sense of fellowship as against the outer barbarians. 
They were a group of kindred peoples linked by the spoken and
afterwards by the written word, and sharing common ideals of courage
and behaviour.

The epics showed the Greeks a barbaric people without iron, without
writing, and still not living in cities.  They seem to have lived at
first in open villages of huts around the halls of their chiefs outside
the ruins of the Ægean cities they had destroyed.  Then they began to
wall their cities and to adopt the idea of temples from the people they
had conquered.  It has been said that the cities of the primitive
civilizations grew up about the altar of some tribal god, and that the
wall was added; in the cities of the Greeks the wall preceded the
temple.  They began to trade and send out colonies.  By the seventh
century B.C. a new series of cities had grown up in the valleys and
islands of Greece, forgetful of the Ægean cities and civilization that
had preceded them; Athens, Sparta, Corinth, Thebes, Samos, Miletus
among the chief. There were already Greek settlements along the coast
of the Black Sea and in Italy and Sicily.  The heel and toe of Italy
was called Magna Græcia.  Marseilles was a Greek town established on
the site of an earlier Phœnician colony.

Now countries which are great plains or which have as a chief means of
transport some great river like the Euphrates or Nile tend to become
united under some common rule.  The cities of Egypt and the cities of
Sumeria, for example, ran together under one system of government. But
the Greek peoples were cut up among islands and mountain valleys; both
Greece and Magna Græcia are very mountainous; and the tendency was all
the other way.  When the Greeks come into history they are divided up
into a number of little states which showed no signs of coalescence. 
They are different even in race.  Some consist chiefly of citizens of
this or that Greek tribe, Ionic, Æolian or Doric; some have a mingled
population of Greeks and descendants of the pre-Greek “Mediterranean”
folk; some have an unmixed free citizenship of Greeks lording it over
an enslaved conquered population like the “Helots” in Sparta.  In some
the old leaderly Aryan families have become a close aristocracy; in
some there is a democracy of all the Aryan citizens; in some there are
elected or even hereditary kings, in some usurpers or tyrants.

And the same geographical conditions that kept the Greek states divided
and various, kept them small.  The largest states were smaller than
many English counties, and it is doubtful if the population of any of
their cities ever exceeded a third of a million.  Few came up even to
50,000. There were unions of interest and sympathy but no coalescences.
 Cities made leagues and alliances as trade increased, and small cities
put themselves under the protection of great ones.  Yet all Greece was
held together in a certain community of feeling by two things, by the
epics and by the custom of taking part every fourth year in the
athletic contests at Olympia.  This did not prevent wars and feuds, but
it mitigated something of the savagery of war between them, and a truce
protected all travellers to and from the games.  As time went on the
sentiment of a common heritage grew and the number of states
participating in the Olympic games increased until at last not only
Greeks but competitors from the closely kindred countries of Epirus and
Macedonia to the north were admitted.

The Greek cities grew in trade and importance, and the quality of their
civilization rose steadily in the seventh and sixth centuries B.C. 
Their social life differed in many interesting points from the social
life of the Ægean and river valley civilizations. They had splendid
temples but the priesthood was not the great traditional body it was in
the cities of the older world, the-repository of all knowledge, the
storehouse of ideas.  They had leaders and noble families, but no
quasi- divine monarch surrounded by an elaborately organized court.
Rather their organization was aristocratic, with leading families which
kept each other in order.  Even their so- called “democracies” were
aristocratic; every citizen had a share in public affairs and came to
the assembly in a democracy, _but everybody was not a citizen_.  The
Greek democracies were not like our modern “democracies” in which
everyone has a vote.  Many of the Greek democracies had a few hundred
or a few thousand citizens and then many thousands of slaves, freedmen
and so forth, with no share in public affairs.  Generally in Greece
affairs were in the hands of a community of substantial men. Their
kings and their tyrants alike were just men set in front of other men
or usurping a leadership; they were not quasi-divine overmen like
Pharaoh or Minos or the monarchs of Mesopotamia.  Both thought and
government therefore had a freedom under Greek conditions such as they
had known in none of the older civilizations.  The Greeks had brought
down into cities the individualism, the personal initiative of the
wandering life of the northern parklands.  They were the first
republicans of importance in history.

And we find that as they emerge from a condition of barbaric warfare a
new thing becomes apparent in their intellectual life.  We find men who
are not priests seeking and recording knowledge and enquiring into the
mysteries of life and being, in a way that has hitherto been the
sublime privilege of priesthood or the presumptuous amusement of kings.
 We find already in the sixth century B.C.—perhaps while Isaiah was
still prophesying in Babylon—such men as Thales and Anaximander of
Miletus and Heraclitus of Ephesus, who were what we should now call
independent gentlemen, giving their minds to shrewd questionings of the
world in which we live, asking what its real nature was, whence it came
and what its destiny might be, and refusing all ready-made or evasive
answers.  Of these questionings of the universe by the Greek mind, we
shall have more to say a little later in this history.  These Greek
enquirers who begin to be remarkable in the sixth century B.C. are the
first philosophers, the first “wisdom-lovers,” in the world.

And it may be noted here how important a century this sixth century
B.C. was in the history of humanity.  For not only were these Greek
philosophers beginning the research for clear ideas about this universe
and man’s place in it and Isaiah carrying Jewish prophecy to its
sublimest levels, but as we shall tell later Gautama Buddha was then
teaching in India and Confucius and Lao Tse in China. From Athens to
the Pacific the human mind was astir.




XXIV
THE WARS OF THE GREEKS AND PERSIANS


While the Greeks in the cities in Greece, South Italy and Asia Minor
were embarking upon free intellectual enquiry and while in Babylon and
Jerusalem the last of the Hebrew prophets were creating a free
conscience for mankind, two adventurous Aryan peoples, the Medes and
the Persians, were in possession of the civilization of the ancient
world and were making a great empire, the Persian empire, which was far
larger in extent than any empire the world had seen hitherto. Under
Cyrus, Babylon and the rich and ancient civilization of Lydia had been
added to the Persian rule; the Phœnician cities of the Levant and all
the Greek cities in Asia Minor had been made tributary, Cambyses had
subjected Egypt, and Darius I, the Mede, the third of the Persian
rulers (521 B.C.), found himself monarch as it seemed of all the world.
His couriers rode with his decrees from the Dardanelles to the Indus
and from Upper Egypt to Central Asia.

The Greeks in Europe, it is true, Italy, Carthage, Sicily and the
Spanish Phœnician settlements, were not under the Persian Peace; but
they treated it with respect and the only people who gave any serious
trouble were the old parent hordes of Nordic people in South Russia and
Central Asia, the Scythians, who raided the northern and north-eastern
borders.

Of course the population of this great Persian empire was not a
population of Persians, The Persians were only the small conquering
minority of this enormous realm.  The rest of the population was what
it had been before the Persians came from time immemorial, only that
Persian was the administrative language.  Trade and finance were still
largely Semitic, Tyre and Sidon as of old were the great Mediterranean
ports and Semitic shipping plied upon the seas.  But many of these
Semitic merchants and business people as they went from place to place
already found a sympathetic and convenient common history in the Hebrew
tradition and the Hebrew scriptures.  A new element which was
increasing rapidly in this empire was the Greek element.  The Greeks
were becoming serious rivals to the Semites upon the sea, and their
detached and vigorous intelligence made them useful and, unprejudiced
officials.

It was on account of the Scythians that Darius I invaded Europe.  He
wanted to reach South Russia, the homeland of the Scythian horsemen. 
He crossed the Bosphorus with a great army and marched through Bulgaria
to the Danube, crossed this by a bridge of boats and pushed far
northward.  His army suffered terribly.  It was largely an infantry
force and the mounted Scythians rode all round it, cut off its
supplies, destroyed any stragglers and never came to a pitched battle.
Darius was forced into an inglorious retreat.

He returned himself to Susa but he left an army in Thrace and
Macedonia, and Macedonia submitted to Darius.  Insurrections of the
Greek cities in Asia followed this failure, and the European Greeks
were drawn into the contest.  Darius resolved upon the subjugation of
the Greeks in Europe.  With the Phœnician fleet at his disposal he was
able to subdue one island after another, and finally in 490 B.C. he
made his main attack upon Athens.  A considerable Armada sailed from
the ports of Asia Minor and the eastern Mediterranean, and the
expedition landed its troops at Marathon to the north of Athens.  There
they were met and signally defeated by the Athenians.

An extraordinary thing happened at this time.  The bitterest rival of
Athens in Greece was Sparta, but now Athens appealed to Sparta, sending
a herald, a swift runner, imploring the Spartans not to let Greeks
become slaves to barbarians.  This runner (the prototype of all
“Marathon” runners) did over a hundred miles of broken country in less
than two days.  The Spartans responded promptly and generously; but
when, in three days, the Spartan force reached Athens, there was
nothing for it to do but to view the battlefield and the bodies of the
defeated Persian soldiers.  The Persian fleet had returned to Asia.  So
ended the first Persian attack on Greece.

The next was much more impressive.  Darius died soon after the news of
his defeat at Marathon reached him, and for four years his son and
successor, Xerxes, prepared a host to crush the Greeks.  For a time
terror united all the Greeks.  The army of Xerxes was certainly the
greatest that had hitherto been assembled in the world.  It was a huge
assembly of discordant elements.  It crossed the Dardanelles, 480 B.C.,
by a bridge of boats; and along the coast as it advanced moved an
equally miscellaneous fleet carrying supplies.  At the narrow pass of
Thermopylæ a small force of 1400 men under the Spartan Leonidas
resisted this multitude, and after a fight of unsurpassed heroism was
completely destroyed.  Every man was killed.  But the losses they
inflicted upon the Persians were enormous, and the army of Xerxes
pushed on to Thebes and Athens in a chastened mood. Thebes surrendered
and made terms.  The Athenians abandoned their city and it was burnt.

Greece seemed in the hands of the conqueror, but again came victory
against the odds and all expectations.  The Greek fleet, though not a
third the size of the Persian, assailed it in the bay of Salamis and
destroyed it.  Xerxes found himself and his immense army cut off from
supplies and his heart failed him.  He retreated to Asia with one half
of his army, leaving the rest to be defeated at Platea (479 B.C.) what
time the remnants of the Persian fleet were hunted down by the Greeks
and destroyed at Mycalæ in Asia Minor.

The Persian danger was at an end.  Most of the Greek cities in Asia
became free.  All this is told in great detail and with much
picturesqueness in the first of written histories, the _History_ of
Herodotus.  This Herodotus was born about 484 B.C. in the Ionian city
of Halicarnassus in Asia Minor, and he visited Babylon and Egypt in his
search for exact particulars.  From Mycalæ onward Persia sank into a
confusion of dynastic troubles.  Xerxes was murdered in 465 B.C. and
rebellions in Egypt, Syria and Media broke up the brief order of that
mighty realm.  The history of Herodotus lays stress on the weakness of
Persia.  This history is indeed what we should now call
propaganda—propaganda for Greece to unite and conquer Persia. 
Herodotus makes one character, Aristagoras, go to the Spartans with a
map of the known world and say to them: “These Barbarians are not
valiant in fight.  You on the other hand have now attained the utmost
skill in war .... No other nations in the world have what they possess:
gold, silver, bronze, embroidered garments, beasts and slaves. _All
this you might have for yourselves, if you so desired_.”

XXV
THE SPLENDOUR OF GREECE


The century and a half that followed the defeat of Persia was one of
very great splendour for the Greek civilization. True that Greece was
torn by a desperate struggle for ascendancy between Athens, Sparta and
other states (the Peloponnesian War 431 to 404 B.C.) and that in 338
B.C. the Macedonians became virtually masters of Greece; nevertheless
during this period the thought and the creative and artistic impulse of
the Greeks rose to levels that made their achievement a lamp to mankind
for all the rest of history.

The head and centre of this mental activity was Athens.  For over
thirty years (466 to 428 B.C.) Athens was dominated by a man of great
vigour and liberality of mind, Pericles, who set himself to rebuild the
city from the ashes to which the Persians had reduced it. The beautiful
ruins that still glorify Athens to-day are chiefly the remains of this
great effort.  And he did not simply rebuild a material Athens.  He
rebuilt Athens intellectually.  He gathered about him not only
architects and sculptors but poets, dramatists, philosophers and
teachers.  Herodotus came to Athens to recite his history (438 B.C.).
Anaxagoras came with the beginnings of a scientific description of the
sun and stars.  Æschylus, Sophocles and Euripides one after the other
carried the Greek drama to its highest levels or beauty and nobility.

The impetus Pericles gave to the intellectual life of Athens lived on
after his death, and in spite of the fact that the peace of Greece was
now broken by the Peloponnesian War and a long and wasteful struggle
for “ascendancy” was beginning.  Indeed the darkling of the political
horizon seems for a time to have quickened rather than discouraged
men’s minds.

Already long before the time of Pericles the peculiar freedom of Greek
institutions had given great importance to skill in discussion. 
Decision rested neither with king nor with priest but in the assemblies
of the people or of leading men.  Eloquence and able argument became
very desirable accomplishments therefore, and a class of teachers
arose, the Sophists, who undertook to strengthen young men in these
arts.  But one cannot reason without matter, and knowledge followed in
the wake of speech.  The activities and rivalries of these Sophists led
very naturally to an acute examination of style, of methods of thought
and of the validity of arguments.  When Pericles died a certain
Socrates was becoming prominent as an able and destructive critic of
bad argument—and much of the teaching of the Sophists was bad argument.
 A group of brilliant young men gathered about Socrates.  In the end
Socrates was executed for disturbing people’s minds (399 B.C.), he was
condemned after the dignified fashion of the Athens of those days to
drink in his own house and among his own friends a poisonous draught
made from hemlock, but the disturbance of people’s minds went on in
spite of his condemnation. His young men carried on his teaching.

Chief among these young men was Plato (427 to 347 B.C.) who presently
began to teach philosophy in the grove of the Academy.  His teaching
fell into two main divisions, an examination of the foundations and
methods of human thinking and an examination of political institutions.
He was the first man to write a Utopia, that is to say the plan of a
community different from and better than any existing community.  This
shows an altogether unprecedented boldness in the human mind which had
hitherto accepted social traditions and usages with scarcely a
question.  Plato said plainly to mankind: “Most of the social and
political ills from which you suffer are under your control, given only
the will and courage to change them.  You can live in another and a
wiser fashion if you choose to think it out and work it out.  You are
not awake to your own power.”  That is a high adventurous teaching that
has still to soak in to the common intelligence of our race.  One of
his earliest works was the Republic, a dream of a communist
aristocracy; his last unfinished work was the Laws, a scheme of
regulation for another such Utopian state.

The criticism of methods of thinking and methods of government was
carried on after Plato’s death by Aristotle, who had been his pupil and
who taught in the Lyceum.  Aristotle came from the city of Stagira in
Macedonia, and his father was court physician to the Macedonian king. 
For a time Aristotle was tutor to Alexander, the king’s son, who was
destined to achieve very great things of which we shall soon be
telling.  Aristotle’s work upon methods of thinking carried the science
of Logic to a level at which it remained for fifteen hundred years or
more, until the mediæval schoolmen took up the ancient questions again.
 He made no Utopias.  Before man could really control his destiny as
Plato taught, Aristotle perceived that he needed far more knowledge and
far more accurate knowledge than he possessed. And so Aristotle began
that systematic collection of knowledge which nowadays we call Science.
 He sent out explorers to collect _facts_.  He was the father of
natural history.  He was the founder of political science. His students
at the Lyceum examined and compared the constitutions of 158 different
states ....

Here in the fourth century B.C. we find men who are practically “modern
thinkers.” The child-like, dream-like methods of primitive thought had
given way to a disciplined and critical attack upon the problems of
life.  The weird and monstrous symbolism and imagery of the gods and
god monsters, and all the taboos and awes and restraints that have
hitherto encumbered thinking are here completely set aside.  Free,
exact and systematic thinking has begun.  The fresh and unencumbered
mind of these newcomers out of the northern forests has thrust itself
into the mysteries of the temple and let the daylight in.




XXVI
THE EMPIRE OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT


From 431 to 404 B.C. the Peloponnesian War wasted Greece. Meanwhile to
the north of Greece, the kindred country of Macedonia was rising slowly
to power and civilization. The Macedonians spoke a language closely
akin to Greek, and on several occasions Macedonian competitors had
taken part in the Olympic games. In 359 B.C. a man of very great
abilities and ambition became king of this little country—Philip.
Philip had previously been a hostage in Greece; he had had a thoroughly
Greek education and he was probably aware of the ideas of
Herodotus—which had also been developed by the philosopher Isocrates—of
a possible conquest of Asia by a consolidated Greece.

He set himself first to extend and organize his own realm and to
remodel his army.  For a thousand years now the charging horse-chariot
had been the decisive factor in battles, that and the close-fighting
infantry.  Mounted horsemen had also fought, but as a cloud of
skirmishers, individually and without discipline.  Philip made his
infantry fight in a closely packed mass, the Macedonian phalanx, and he
trained his mounted gentlemen, the knights or companions, to fight in
formation and so invented cavalry.  The master move in most of his
battles and in the battles of his son Alexander was a cavalry charge. 
The phalanx _held_ the enemy infantry in front while the cavalry swept
away the enemy horse on his wings and poured in on the flank and rear
of his infantry. Chariots were disabled by bowmen, who shot the horses.

With this new army Philip extended his frontiers through Thessaly to
Greece; and the battle of Chæronia (338 B.C.), fought against Athens
and her allies, put all Greece at his feet.  At last the dream of
Herodotus was bearing fruit.  A congress of all the Greek states
appointed Philip captain-general of the Græco- Macedonian confederacy
against Persia, and in 336 B.C. his advanced guard crossed into Asia
upon this long premeditated adventure.  But he never followed it.  He
was assassinated; it is believed at the instigation of his queen
Olympias, Alexander’s mother.  She was jealous because Philip had
married a second wife.

But Philip had taken unusual pains with his son’s education.  He had
not only secured Aristotle, the greatest philosopher in the world, as
this boy’s tutor, but he had shared his ideas with him and thrust
military experience upon him.  At Chæronia Alexander, who was then only
eighteen years old, had been in command of the cavalry.  And so it was
possible for this young man, who was still only twenty years old at the
time of his accession, to take up his father’s task at once and to
proceed successfully with the Persian adventure.

In 334 B.C.—for two years were needed to establish and confirm his
position in Macedonia and Greece—he crossed into Asia, defeated a not
very much bigger Persian army at the battle of the Granicus and
captured a number of cities in Asia Minor.  He kept along the
sea-coast.  It was necessary for him to reduce and garrison all the
coast towns as he advanced because the Persians had control of the
fleets of Tyre and Sidon and so had command of the sea.  Had he left a
hostile port in his rear the Persians might have landed forces to raid
his communications and cut him off. At  Issus (333 B.C.) he met and
smashed a vast conglomerate host under Darius III.  Like the host of
Xerxes that had crossed the Dardanelles a century and a half before, it
was an incoherent accumulation of contingents and it was encumbered
with a multitude of court officials, the harem of Darius and many camp
followers.  Sidon surrendered to Alexander but Tyre resisted
obstinately.  Finally that great city was stormed and plundered and
destroyed.  Gaza also was stormed, and towards the end of 332 B.C. the
conqueror entered Egypt and took over its rule from the Persians.

At Alexandretta and at Alexandria in Egypt he built great cities,
accessible from the land and so incapable of revolt. To these the trade
of the Phœnician cities was diverted. The Phœnicians of the western
Mediterranean suddenly disappear from history—and as immediately the
Jews of Alexandria and the other new trading cities created by
Alexander appear.

In 331 B.C. Alexander marched out of Egypt upon Babylon as Thothmes and
Rameses and Necho had done before him.  But he marched by way of Tyre. 
At Arbela near the ruins of Nineveh, which was already a forgotten
city, he met Darius and fought the decisive battle of the war.  The
Persian chariot charge failed, a Macedonian cavalry charge broke up the
great composite host and the phalanx completed the victory.  Darius led
the retreat.  He made no further attempt to resist the invader but fled
northward into the country of the Medes.  Alexander marched on to
Babylon, still prosperous and important, and then to Susa and
Persepolis.  There after a drunken festival he burnt down the palace of
Darius, the king of kings.


THE APOLLO BELVEDERE

Thence Alexander presently made a military parade of central Asia,
going to the utmost bounds of the Persian empire.  At first he turned
northward.  Darius was pursued; and he was overtaken at dawn dying in
his chariot, having been murdered by his own people.  He was still
living when the foremost Greeks reached him.  Alexander came up to find
him dead. Alexander skirted the Caspian Sea, he went up into the
mountains of western Turkestan, he came down by Herat (which he
founded) and Cabul and the Khyber Pass into India.  He fought a great
battle on the Indus with an Indian king, Porus, and here the Macedonian
troops met elephants for the first time and defeated them.  Finally he
built himself ships, sailed down to the mouth of the Indus, and marched
back by the coast of Beluchistan, reaching Susa again in 324 B.C. after
an absence of six years. He then prepared to consolidate and organize
this vast empire he had won.  He sought to win over his new subjects. 
He assumed the robes and tiara of a Persian monarch, and this roused
the jealousy of his Macedonian commanders.  He had much trouble with
them.  He arranged a number of marriages between these Macedonian
officers and Persian and Babylonian women: the “Marriage of the East
and West.”  He never lived to effect the consolidation he had planned. 
A fever seized him after a drinking bout in Babylon and he died in 323
B.C.

Immediately this vast dominion fell to pieces.  One of his generals,
Seleucus, retained most of the old Persian empire from the Indus to
Ephesus; another, Ptolemy, seized Egypt, and Antigonus secured
Macedonia.  The rest of the empire remained unstable, passing under the
control of a succession of local adventurers.  Barbarian raids began
from the north and grew in scope and intensity.  Until at last, as we
shall tell, a new power, the power of the Roman republic, came out of
the west to subjugate one fragment after another and weld them together
into a new and more enduring empire.




XXVII
THE MUSEUM AND LIBRARY AT ALEXANDRIA


Before the time of Alexander Greeks had already been spreading as
merchants, artists, officials, mercenary soldiers, over most of the
Persian dominions. In the dynastic disputes that followed the death of
Xerxes, a band of ten thousand Greek mercenaries played a part under
the leadership of Xenophon. Their return to Asiatic Greece from Babylon
is described in his _Retreat of the Ten Thousand_, one of the first war
stories that was ever written by a general in command. But the
conquests of Alexander and the division of his brief empire among his
subordinate generals, greatly stimulated this permeation of the ancient
world by the Greeks and their language and fashions and culture. Traces
of this Greek dissemination are to be found far away in central Asia
and in north-west India. Their influence upon the development of Indian
art was profound.

For many centuries Athens retained her prestige as a centre of art and
culture; her schools went on indeed to 529 A.D., that is to say for
nearly a thousand years; but the leadership in the intellectual
activity of the world passed presently across the Mediterranean to
Alexandria, the new trading city that Alexander had founded. Here the
Macedonian general Ptolemy had become Pharaoh, with a court that spoke
Greek.  He had become an intimate of Alexander before he became king,
and he was deeply saturated with the ideas of Aristotle.  He set
himself, with great energy and capacity, to organize knowledge and
investigation. He also wrote a history of Alexander’s campaigns which,
unhappily, is lost to the world.

Alexander had already devoted considerable sums to finance the
enquiries of Aristotle, but Ptolemy I was the first person to make a
permanent endowment of science.  He set up a foundation in Alexandria
which was formerly dedicated to the Muses, the Museum of Alexandria. 
For two or three generations the scientific work done at Alexandria was
extraordinarily good.  Euclid, Eratosthenes who measured the size of
the earth and came within fifty miles of its true diameter, Apollonius
who wrote on conic sections, Hipparchus who made the first star map and
catalogue, and Hero who devised the first steam engine are among the
greater stars of an extraordinary constellation of scientific pioneers.
Archimedes came from Syracuse to Alexandria to study, and was a
frequent correspondent of the Museum.  Herophilus was one of the
greatest of Greek anatomists, and is said to have practised
vivisection.

For a generation or so during the reigns of Ptolemy I and Ptolemy II
there was such a blaze of knowledge and discovery at Alexandria as the
world was not to see again until the sixteenth century A.D.  But it did
not continue.  There may have been several causes of this decline. 
Chief among them, the late Professor Mahaffy suggested, was the fact
that the Museum was a “royal” college and all its professors and
fellows were appointed and paid by Pharaoh.  This was all very well
when Pharaoh was Ptolemy I, the pupil and friend of Aristotle.  But as
the dynasty of the Ptolemies went on they became Egyptianized, they
fell under the sway of Egyptian priests and Egyptian religious
developments, they ceased to follow the work that was done, and their
control stifled the spirit of enquiry altogether.  The Museum produced
little good work after its first century of activity.

Ptolemy I not only sought in the most modern spirit to organize the
finding of fresh knowledge.  He tried also to set up an encyclopædic
storehouse of wisdom in the Library of Alexandria.  It was not simply a
storehouse, it was also a book-copying and book-selling organization. 
A great army of copyists was set to work perpetually multiplying copies
of books.

Here then we have the definite first opening up of the intellectual
process in which we live to-day; here we have the systematic gathering
and distribution of knowledge.  The foundation of this Museum and
Library marks one of the great epochs in the history of mankind.  It is
the true beginning of Modern History.

Both the work of research and the work of dissemination went on under
serious handicaps.  One of these was the great social gap that
separated the philosopher, who was a gentleman, from the trader and the
artisan.  There were glass workers and metal workers in abundance in
those days, but they were not in mental contact with the thinkers.  The
glass worker was making the most beautifully coloured beads and phials
and so forth, but he never made a Florentine flask or a lens.  Clear
glass does not seem to have interested him. The metal worker made
weapons and jewellery but he never made a chemical balance.  The
philosopher speculated loftily about atoms and the nature of things,
but he had no practical experience of enamels and pigments and philters
and so forth. He was not interested in substances.  So Alexandria in
its brief day of opportunity produced no microscopes and no chemistry. 
And though Hero invented a steam engine it was never set either to pump
or drive a boat or do any useful thing.  There were few practical
applications of science except in the realm of medicine, and the
progress of science was not stimulated and sustained by the interest
and excitement of practical applications.  There was nothing to keep
the work going therefore when the intellectual curiosity of Ptolemy I
and Ptolemy II was withdrawn.  The discoveries of the Museum went on
record in obscure manuscripts and never, until the revival of
scientific curiosity at the Renascence, reached out to the mass of
mankind.

Nor did the Library produce any improvements in book making. That
ancient world had no paper made in definite sizes from rag pulp.  Paper
was a Chinese invention and it did not reach the western world until
the ninth century A.D.  The only book materials were parchment and
strips of the papyrus reed joined edge to edge.  These strips were kept
on rolls which were very unwieldy to wind to and fro and read, and very
inconvenient for reference.  It was these things that prevented the
development of paged and printed books.  Printing itself was known in
the world it would seem as early as the Old Stone Age; there were seals
in ancient Sumeria; but without abundant paper there was little
advantage in printing books, an improvement that may further have been
resisted by trades unionism on the part of the copyists employed. 
Alexandria produced abundant books but not cheap books, and it never
spread knowledge into the population of the ancient world below the
level of a wealthy and influential class.

So it was that this blaze of intellectual enterprise never reached
beyond a small circle of people in touch with the group of philosophers
collected by the first two Ptolemies. It was like the light in a dark
lantern which is shut off from the world at large.  Within the blaze
may be blindingly bright, but nevertheless it is unseen.  The rest of
the world went on its old ways unaware that the seed of scientific
knowledge that was one day to revolutionize it altogether had been
sown.  Presently a darkness of bigotry fell even upon Alexandria.
Thereafter for a thousand years of darkness the seed that Aristotle had
sown lay hidden.  Then it stirred and began to germinate.  In a few
centuries it had become that widespread growth of knowledge and clear
ideas that is now changing the whole of human life.

Alexandria was not the only centre of Greek intellectual activity in
the third century B.C. There were many other cities that displayed a
brilliant intellectual life amidst the disintegrating fragments of the
brief empire of Alexander.  There was, for example, the Greek city of
Syracuse in Sicily, where thought and science flourished for two
centuries; there was Pergamum in Asia Minor, which also had a great
library.  But this brilliant Hellenic world was now stricken by
invasion from the north. New Nordic barbarians, the Gauls, were
striking down along the tracks that had once been followed by the
ancestors of the Greeks and Phrygians and Macedonians.  They raided,
shattered and destroyed.  And in the wake of the Gauls came a new
conquering people out of Italy, the Romans, who gradually subjugated
all the western half of the vast realm of Darius and Alexander.  They
were an able but unimaginative people, preferring law and profit to
either science or art.  New invaders were also coming down out of
central Asia to shatter and subdue the Seleucid empire and to cut off
the western world again from India.  These were the Parthians, hosts of
mounted bowmen, who treated the Græco-Persian empire of Persepolis and
Susa in the third century B.C. in much the same fashion that the Medes
and Persians had treated it in the seventh and sixth.  And there were
now other nomadic peoples also coming out of the northeast, peoples who
were not fair and Nordic and Aryan- speaking but yellow-skinned and
black-haired and with a Mongolian speech.  But of these latter people
we shall tell more in a subsequent chapter.




XXVIII
THE LIFE OF GAUTAMA BUDDHA


But now we must go back three centuries in our story to tell of a great
teacher who came near to revolutionizing the religious thought and
feeling of all Asia. This was Gautama Buddha, who taught his disciples
at Benares in India about the same time that Isaiah was prophesying
among the Jews in Babylon and Heraclitus was carrying on his
speculative enquiries into the nature of things at Ephesus. All these
men were in the world at the same time, in the sixth century
B.C.—unaware of one another.

This sixth century B.C. was indeed one of the most remarkable in all
history. Everywhere—for as we shall tell it was also the case in
China—men’s minds were displaying a new boldness. Everywhere they were
waking up out of the traditions of kingships and priests and blood
sacrifices and asking the most penetrating questions.  It is as if the
race had reached a stage of adolescence—after a childhood of twenty
thousand years.

The early history of India is still very obscure.  Somewhen perhaps
about 2000 B.C., an Aryan- speaking people came down from the
north-west into India either in one invasion or in a series of
invasions; and was able to spread its language and traditions over most
of north India.  Its peculiar variety of Aryan speech was the Sanskrit.
 They found a brunette people with a more elaborate civilization and
less vigour of will, in possession of the country of the Indus and
Ganges.  But they do not seem to have mingled with their predecessors
as freely as did the Greeks and Persians.  They remained aloof.  When
the past of India becomes dimly visible to the historian, Indian
society is already stratified into several layers, with a variable
number of sub-divisions, which do not eat together nor intermarry nor
associate freely.  And throughout history this stratification into
castes continues.  This makes the Indian population something different
from the simple, freely inter-breeding European or Mongolian
communities.  It is really a community of communities.

Siddhattha Gautama was the son of an aristocratic family which ruled a
small district on the Himalayan slopes.  He was married at nineteen to
a beautiful cousin.  He hunted and played and went about in his sunny
world of gardens and groves and irrigated rice-fields.  And it was
amidst this life that a great discontent fell upon him.  It was the
unhappiness of a fine brain that seeks employment.  He felt that the
existence he was leading was not the reality of life, but a holiday—a
holiday that had gone on too long.

The sense of disease and mortality, the insecurity and the
un-satisfactoriness of all happiness, descended upon the mind of
Gautama.  While he was in this mood he met one of those wandering
ascetics who already existed in great numbers in India.  These men
lived under severe rules, spending much time in meditation and in
religious discussion.  They were supposed to be seeking some deeper
reality in life, and a passionate desire to do likewise took possession
of Gautama.

He was meditating upon this project, says the story, when the news was
brought to him that his wife had been delivered of his first-born son.
“This is another tie to break,” said Gautama.

He returned to the village amidst the rejoicings of his fellow
clansmen.  There was a great feast and a Nautch dance to celebrate the
birth of this new tie, and in the night Gautama awoke in a great agony
of spirit, “like a man who is told that his house is on fire.”  He
resolved to leave his happy aimless life forthwith.  He went softly to
the threshold of his wife’s chamber, and saw her by the light of a
little oil lamp, sleeping sweetly, surrounded by flowers, with his
infant son in her arms.  He felt a great craving to take up the child
in one first and last embrace before he departed, but the fear of
waking his wife prevented him, and at last he turned away and went out
into the bright Indian moonshine and mounted his horse and rode off
into the world.

Very far he rode that night, and in the morning he stopped outside the
lands of his clan, and dismounted beside a sandy river.  There he cut
off his flowing locks with his sword, removed all his ornaments and
sent them and his horse and sword back to his house.  Going on he
presently met a ragged man and exchanged clothes with him, and so
having divested himself of all worldly entanglements he was free to
pursue his search after wisdom. He made his way southward to a resort
of hermits and teachers in a hilly spur of the Vindhya Mountains. 
There lived a number of wise men in a warren of caves, going into the
town for their simple supplies and imparting their knowledge by word of
mouth to such as cared to come to them.  Gautama became versed in all
the metaphysics of his age.  But his acute intelligence was
dissatisfied with the solutions offered him.

The Indian mind has always been disposed to believe that power and
knowledge may be obtained by extreme asceticism, by fasting,
sleeplessness, and self-torment, and these ideas Gautama now put to the
test.  He betook himself with five disciple companions to the jungle
and there he gave himself up to fasting and terrible penances.  His
fame spread, “like the sound of a great bell hung in the canopy of the
skies.”  But it brought him no sense of truth achieved. One day he was
walking up and down, trying to think in spite of his enfeebled state. 
Suddenly he fell unconscious.  When he recovered, the preposterousness
of these semi-magical ways to wisdom was plain to him.

_(From a Painting in the India Museum)_


He horrified his companions by demanding ordinary food and refusing to
continue his mortifications.  He had realized that whatever truth a man
may reach is reached best by a nourished brain in a healthy body.  Such
a conception was absolutely foreign to the ideas of the land and age. 
His disciples deserted him, and went off in a melancholy state to
Benares.  Gautama wandered alone.

When the mind grapples with a great and intricate problem, it makes its
advances step by step, with but little realization of the gains it has
made, until suddenly, with an effect of abrupt illumination, it
realizes its victory.  So it happened to Gautama.  He had seated
himself under a great tree by the side of a river to eat, when this
sense of clear vision came to him.  It seemed to him that he saw life
plain.  He is said to have sat all day and all night in profound
thought, and then he rose up to impart his vision to the world.

He went on to Benares and there he sought out and won back his lost
disciples to his new teaching.  In the King’s Deer Park at Benares they
built themselves huts and set up a sort of school to which came many
who were seeking after wisdom.

The starting point of his teaching was his own question as a fortunate
young man, “Why am I not completely happy?”  It was an introspective
question. It was a question very different in quality from the frank
and self-forgetful _externalized_ curiosity with which Thales and
Heraclitus were attacking the problems of the universe, or the equally
self-forgetful burthen of moral obligation that the culminating
prophets were imposing upon the Hebrew mind.  The Indian teacher did
not forget self, he concentrated upon self and sought to destroy it. 
All suffering, he taught, was due to the greedy desires of the
individual.  Until man has conquered his personal cravings his life is
trouble and his end sorrow.  There were three principal forms that the
craving for life took and they were all evil.  The first was the desire
of the appetites, greed and all forms of sensuousness, the second was
the desire for a personal and egotistic immortality, the third was the
craving for personal success, worldliness, avarice and the like.  All
these forms of desire had to be overcome to escape from the distresses
and chagrins of life.  When they were overcome, when self had vanished
altogether, then serenity of soul, Nirvana, the highest good was
attained.

This was the gist of his teaching, a very subtle and metaphysical
teaching indeed, not nearly so easy to understand as the Greek
injunction to see and know fearlessly and rightly and the Hebrew
command to fear God and accomplish righteousness.  It was a teaching
much beyond the understanding of even Gautama’s immediate disciples,
and it is no wonder that so soon as his personal influence was
withdrawn it became corrupted and coarsened.  There was a widespread
belief in India at that time that at long intervals Wisdom came to
earth and was incarnate in some chosen person who was known as the
Buddha.  Gautama’s disciples declared that he was a Buddha, the latest
of the Buddhas, though there is no evidence that he himself ever
accepted the title.  Before he was well dead, a cycle of fantastic
legends began to be woven about him.  The human heart has always
preferred a wonder story to a moral effort, and Gautama Buddha became
very wonderful.

Yet there remained a substantial gain in the world.  If Nirvana was too
high and subtle for most men’s imaginations, if the myth-making impulse
in the race was too strong for the simple facts of Gautama’s life, they
could at least grasp something of the intention of what Gautama called
the Eight-fold way, the Aryan or Noble Path in life.  In this there was
an insistence upon mental uprightness, upon right aims and speech,
right conduct and honest livelihood.  There was a quickening of the
conscience and an appeal to generous and self-forgetful ends.




XXIX
KING ASOKA


For some generations after the death of Gautama, these high and noble
Buddhist teachings, this first plain teaching that the highest good for
man is the subjugation of self, made comparatively little headway in
the world. Then they conquered the imagination of one of the greatest
monarchs the world has ever seen.

We have already mentioned how Alexander the Great came down into India
and fought with Porus upon the Indus.  It is related by the Greek
historians that a certain Chandragupta Maurya came into Alexander’s
camp and tried to persuade him to go on to the Ganges and conquer all
India. Alexander could not do this because of the refusal of his
Macedonians to go further into what was for them an unknown world, and
later on (303 B.C.) Chandragupta was able to secure the help or various
hill tribes and realize his dream without Greek help. He built up an
empire in North India and was presently (303 B.C.) able to attack
Seleucus I in the Punjab and drive the last vestige of Greek power out
of India. His son extended this new empire. His grandson, Asoka, the
monarch of whom we now have to tell, found himself in 264 B.C. ruling
from Afghanistan to Madras.

Asoka was at first disposed to follow the example of his father and
grandfather and complete the conquest of the Indian peninsula.  He
invaded Kalinga (255 B.C.), a country on the east coast of Madras, he
was successful in his military operations and—alone among conquerors—he
was so disgusted by the cruelty and horror of war that he renounced it.
 He would have no more of it.  He adopted the peaceful doctrines of
Buddhism and declared that henceforth his conquests should be the
conquests of religion.

His reign for eight-and-twenty years was one of the brightest
interludes in the troubled history of mankind.  He organized a great
digging of wells in India and the planting of trees for shade.  He
founded hospitals and public gardens and gardens for the growing of
medicinal herbs.  He created a ministry for the care of the aborigines
and subject races of India. He made provision for the education of
women.  He made vast benefactions to the Buddhist teaching orders, and
tried to stimulate them to a better and more energetic criticism of
their own accumulated literature.  For corruptions and superstitious
accretions had accumulated very speedily upon the pure and simple
teaching of the great Indian master. Missionaries went from Asoka to
Kashmir, to Persia, to Ceylon and Alexandria.

Such was Asoka, greatest of kings.  He was far in advance of his age. 
He left no prince and no organization of men to carry on his work, and
within a century of his death the great days of his reign had become a
glorious memory in a shattered and decaying India.  The priestly caste
of the Brahmins, the highest and most privileged caste in the Indian
social body, has always been opposed to the frank and open teaching of
Buddha.  Gradually they undermined the Buddhist influence in the land. 
The old monstrous gods, the innumerable cults of Hinduism, resumed
their sway.  Caste became more rigorous and complicated. For long
centuries Buddhism and Brahminism flourished side by side, and then
slowly Buddhism decayed and Brahminism in a multitude of forms replaced
it.  But beyond the confines of India and the realms of caste Buddhism
spread—until it had won China and Siam and Burma and Japan, countries
in which it is predominant to this day.

XXX
CONFUCIUS AND LAO TSE


We have still to tell of two other great men, Confucius and Lao Tse,
who lived in that wonderful century which began the adolescence of
mankind, the sixth century B.C. In this history thus far we have told
very little of the early story of China. At present that early history
is still very obscure, and we look to Chinese explorers and
archæolologists in the new China that is now arising to work out their
past as thoroughly as the European past has been worked out during the
last century. Very long ago the first primitive Chinese civilizations
arose in the great river valleys out of the primordial heliolithic
culture. They had, like Egypt and Sumeria, the general characteristics
of that culture, and they centred upon temples in which priests and
priest kings offered the seasonal blood sacrifices. The life in those
cities must have been very like the Egyptian and Sumerian life of six
or seven thousand years ago and very like the Maya life of Central
America a thousand years ago.

If there were human sacrifices they had long given way to animal
sacrifices before the dawn of history.  And a form of picture writing
was growing up long before a thousand years B.C.

And just as the primitive civilizations of Europe and western Asia were
in conflict with the nomads of the desert and the nomads of the north,
so the primitive Chinese civilizations had a great cloud of nomadic
peoples on their northern borders.  There was a number of tribes akin
in language and ways of living, who are spoken of in history in
succession as the Huns, the Mongols, the Turks and Tartars.  They
changed and divided and combined and re-combined, just as the Nordic
peoples in north Europe and central Asia changed and varied in name
rather than in nature.  These Mongolian nomads had horses earlier than
the Nordic peoples, and it may be that in the region of the Altai
Mountains they made an independent discovery of iron somewhen after
1000 B.C. And just as in the western case so ever and again these
eastern nomads would achieve a sort of political unity, and become the
conquerors and masters and revivers of this or that settled and
civilized region.

It is quite possible that the earliest civilization of China was not
Mongolian at all any more than the earliest civilization of Europe and
western Asia was Nordic or Semitic.  It is quite possible that the
earliest civilization of China was a brunette civilization and of a
piece with the earliest Egyptian, Sumerian and Dravidian civilizations,
and that when the first recorded history of China began there had
already been conquests and intermixture.  At any rate we find that by
1750 B.C. China was already a vast system of little kingdoms and city
states, all acknowledging a loose allegiance and paying more or less
regularly, more or less definite feudal dues to one great priest
emperor, the “Son of Heaven.”  The “Shang” dynasty came to an end in
1125 B.C.  A “Chow” dynasty succeeded “Shang,” and maintained China in
a relaxing unity until the days of Asoka in India and of the Ptolemies
in Egypt.  Gradually China went to pieces during that long “Chow”
period.  Hunnish peoples came down and set up principalities; local
rulers discontinued their tribute and became independent.  There was in
the sixth century B.C., says one Chinese authority, five or six
thousand practically independent states in China.  It was what the
Chinese call in their records an “Age of Confusion.”

But this Age of Confusion was compatible with much intellectual
activity and with the existence of many local centres of art and
civilized living.  When we know more of Chinese history we shall find
that China also had her Miletus and her Athens, her Pergamum and her
Macedonia.  At present we must be vague and brief about this period of
Chinese division simply because our knowledge is not sufficient for us
to frame a coherent and consecutive story.


CONFUCIUS
CONFUCIUS

(Chavannes))_


And just as in divided Greece there were philosophers and in shattered
and captive Jewry prophets, so in disordered China there were
philosophers and teachers at this time.  In all these cases insecurity
and uncertainty seemed to have quickened the better sort of mind. 
Confucius was a man of aristocratic origin and some official importance
in a small state called Lu.  Here in a very parallel mood to the Greek
impulse he set up a sort of Academy for discovering and teaching
Wisdom.  The lawlessness and disorder of China distressed him
profoundly.  He conceived an ideal of a better government and a better
life, and travelled from state to state seeking a prince who would
carry out his legislative and educational ideas.  He never found his
prince; he found a prince, but court intrigues undermined the influence
of the teacher and finally defeated his reforming proposals.  It is
interesting to note that a century and a half later the Greek
philosopher Plato also sought a prince, and was for a time adviser to
the tyrant Dionysius who ruled Syracuse in Sicily.

Confucius died a disappointed man.  “No intelligent ruler arises to
take me as his master,” he said, “and my time has come to die.”  But
his teaching had more vitality than he imagined in his declining and
hopeless years, and it became a great formative influence with the
Chinese people.  It became one of what the Chinese call the Three
Teachings, the other two being those of Buddha and of Lao Tse.

The gist of the teaching of Confucius was the way of the noble or
aristocratic man.  He was concerned with personal conduct as much as
Gautama was concerned with the peace of self-forgetfulness and the
Greek with external knowledge and the Jew with righteousness.  He was
the most public-minded of all great teachers.  He was supremely
concerned by the confusion and miseries of the world, and he wanted to
make men noble in order to bring about a noble world.  He sought to
regulate conduct to an extraordinary extent; to provide sound rules for
every occasion in life.  A polite, public- spirited gentleman, rather
sternly self-disciplined, was the ideal he found already developing in
the northern Chinese world and one to which he gave a permanent form.

The teaching of Lao Tse, who was for a long time in charge of the
imperial library of the Chow dynasty, was much more mystical and vague
and elusive than that of Confucius.  He seems to have preached a
stoical indifference to the pleasures and powers of the world and a
return to an imaginary simple life of the past.  He left writings very
contracted in style and very obscure.  He wrote in riddles.  After his
death his teachings, like the teachings of Gautama Buddha, were
corrupted and overlaid by legends and had the most complex and
extraordinary observances and superstitious ideas grafted upon them. 
In China just as in India primordial ideas of magic and monstrous
legends out of the childish past of our race struggled against the new
thinking in the world and succeeded in plastering it over with
grotesque, irrational and antiquated observances.  Both Buddhism and
Taoism (which ascribes itself largely to Lao Tse) as one finds them in
China now, are religions of monk, temple, priest and offering of a type
as ancient in form, if not in thought, as the sacrificial religions of
ancient Sumeria and Egypt.  But the teaching of Confucius was not so
overlaid because it was limited and plain and straightforward and lent
itself to no such distortions.

North China, the China of the Hwang-ho River, became Confucian in
thought and spirit; south China, Yang-tse-Kiang China, became Taoist. 
Since those days a conflict has always been traceable in Chinese
affairs between these two spirits, the spirit of the north and the
spirit of the south, between (in latter times) Pekin and Nankin,
between the official- minded, upright and conservative north, and the
sceptical, artistic, lax and experimental south.

The divisions of China of the Age of Confusion reached their worst
stage in the sixth century B.C. The Chow dynasty was so enfeebled and
so discredited that Lao Tse left the unhappy court and retired into
private life.

Three nominally subordinate powers dominated the situation in those
days, Ts’i and Ts’in, both northern powers, and Ch’u, which was an
aggressive military power in the Yangtse valley.  At last Ts’i and
Ts’in formed an alliance, subdued Ch’u and imposed a general treaty of
disarmament and peace in China.  The power of Ts’in became predominant.
 Finally about the time of Asoka in India the Ts’in monarch seized upon
the sacrificial vessels of the Chow emperor and took over his
sacrificial duties. His son, Shi-Hwang-ti (king in 246 B.C., emperor in
220 B.C.), is called in the Chinese Chronicles “the First Universal
Emperor.”

More fortunate than Alexander, Shi-Hwang-ti reigned for thirty-six
years as king and emperor.  His energetic reign marks the beginning of
a new era of unity and prosperity for the Chinese people.  He fought
vigorously against the Hunnish invaders from the northern deserts, and
he began that immense work, the Great Wall of China, to set a limit to
their incursions.




XXXI
ROME COMES INTO HISTORY


The reader will note a general similarity in the history of all these
civilizations in spite of the effectual separation caused by the great
barriers of the Indian north-west frontier and of the mountain masses
of Central Asia and further India. First for thousands of years the
heliolithic culture spread over all the warm and fertile river valleys
of the old world and developed a temple system and priest rulers about
its sacrificial traditions. Apparently its first makers were always
those brunette peoples we have spoken of as the central race of
mankind. Then the nomads came in from the regions of seasonal grass and
seasonal migrations and superposed their own characteristics and often
their own language on the primitive civilization. They subjugated and
stimulated it, and were stimulated to fresh developments and made it
here one thing and here another. In Mesopotamia it was the Elamite and
then the Semite, and at last the Nordic Medes and Persians and the
Greeks who supplied the ferment; over the region of the Ægean peoples
it was the Greeks; in India it was the Aryan-speakers; in Egypt there
was a thinner infusion of conquerors into a more intensely saturated
priestly civilization; in China, the Hun conquered and was absorbed and
was followed by fresh Huns. China was Mongolized just as Greece and
North India were Aryanized and Mesopotamia Semitized and Aryanized.
Everywhere the nomads destroyed much, but everywhere they brought in a
new spirit of free enquiry and moral innovation. They questioned the
beliefs of immemorial ages. They let daylight into the temples. They
set up kings who were neither priests nor gods but mere leaders among
their captains and companions.

In the centuries following the sixth century B.C. we find everywhere a
great breaking down of ancient traditions and a new spirit of moral and
intellectual enquiry awake, a spirit never more to be altogether
stilled in the great progressive movement of mankind.  We find reading
and writing becoming common and accessible accomplishments among the
ruling and prosperous minority; they were no longer the jealously
guarded secret of the priests.  Travel is increasing and transport
growing easier by reason of horses and roads.  A new and easy device to
facilitate trade has been found in coined money.

Let us now transfer our attention back from China in the extreme east
of the old world to the western half of the Mediterranean.  Here we
have to note the appearance of a city which was destined to play at
last a very great part indeed in human affairs, Rome.

Hitherto we have told very little about Italy in our story. It was
before 1000 B.C. a land of mountain and forest and thinly populated. 
Aryan-speaking tribes had pressed down this peninsula and formed little
towns and cities, and the southern extremity was studded with Greek
settlements.  The noble ruins of Pæstum preserve for us to this day
something of the dignity and splendour of these early Greek
establishments.  A non-Aryan people, probably akin to the Ægean
peoples, the Etruscans, had established themselves in the central part
of the peninsula. They had reversed the usual process by subjugating
various Aryan tribes.  Rome, when it comes into the light of history,
is a little trading city at a ford on the Tiber, with a Latin-speaking
population ruled over by Etruscan kings.  The old chronologies gave 753
B.C. as the date of the founding of Rome, half a century later than the
founding of the great Phœnician city of Carthage and twenty-three years
after the first Olympiad.  Etruscan tombs of a much earlier date than
753 B.C. have, however, been excavated in the Roman Forum.

In that red-letter century, the sixth century B.C., the Etruscan kings
were expelled (510 B.C.) and Rome became an aristocratic republic with
a lordly class of “patrician” families dominating a commonalty of
“plebeians.” Except that it spoke Latin it was not unlike many
aristocratic Greek republics.

For some centuries the internal history of Rome was the story of a long
and obstinate struggle for freedom and a share in the government on the
part of the plebeians.  It would not be difficult to find Greek
parallels to this conflict, which the Greeks would have called a
conflict of aristocracy with democracy.  In the end the plebeians broke
down most of the exclusive barriers of the old families and established
a working equality with them.  They destroyed the old exclusiveness,
and made it possible and acceptable for Rome to extend her citizenship
by the inclusion of more and more “outsiders.”  For while she still
struggled at home, she was extending her power abroad.


REMAINS OF THE ANCIENT ROMAN CISTERNS AT CARTHAGE
REMAINS OF THE ANCIENT ROMAN CISTERNS AT CARTHAGE

The extension of Roman power began in the fifth century B.C.  Until
that time they had waged war, and generally unsuccessful war, with the
Etruscans.  There was an Etruscan fort, Veii, only a few miles from
Rome which the Romans had never been able to capture.  In 474 B.C.,
however, a great misfortune came to the Etruscans.  Their fleet was
destroyed by the Greeks of Syracuse in Sicily.  At the same time a wave
of Nordic invaders came down upon them from the north, the Gauls.
Caught between Roman and Gaul, the Etruscans fell—and disappear from
history.  Veii was captured by the Romans, The Gauls came through to
Rome and sacked the city (390 B.C.A.D.) but could not capture the
Capitol. An attempted night surprise was betrayed by the cackling of
some geese, and finally the invaders were bought off and retired to the
north of Italy again.

The Gaulish raid seems to have invigorated rather than weakened Rome. 
The Romans conquered and assimilated the Etruscans, and extended their
power over all central Italy from the Arno to Naples.  To this they had
reached within a few years of 300 B.C.  Their conquests in Italy were
going on simultaneously with the growth of Philip’s power in Macedonia
and Greece, and the tremendous raid of Alexander to Egypt and the
Indus.  The Romans had become notable people in the civilized world to
the east of them by the break-up of Alexander’s empire.

To the north of the Roman power were the Gauls; to the south of them
were the Greek settlements of Magna Græcia, that is to say of Sicily
and of the toe and heel of Italy.  The Gauls were a hardy, warlike
people and the Romans held that boundary by a line of forts and
fortified settlements.  The Greek cities in the south headed by
Tarentum (now Taranto) and by Syracuse in Sicily, did not so much
threaten as fear the Romans.  They looked about for some help against
these new conquerors.

We have already told how the empire of Alexander fell to pieces and was
divided among his generals and companions. Among these adventurers was
a kinsman of Alexander’s named Pyrrhus, who established himself in
Epirus, which is across the Adriatic Sea over against the heel of
Italy.  It was his ambition to play the part of Philip of Macedonia to
Magna Græcia, and to become protector and master-general of Tarentum,
Syracuse and the rest of that part of the world. He had what was then
it very efficient modern army; he had an infantry phalanx, cavalry from
Thessaly—which was now quite as good as the original Macedonian
cavalry—and twenty fighting elephants; he invaded Italy and routed the
Romans in two considerable battles, Heraclea (280 B.C.) and Ausculum
(279 B.C.), and having driven them north, he turned his attention to
the subjugation of Sicily.

But this brought against him a more formidable enemy than were the
Romans at that time, the Phœnician trading city of Carthage, which was
probably then the greatest city in the world.  Sicily was too near
Carthage for a new Alexander to be welcome there, and Carthage was
mindful of the fate that had befallen her mother city Tyre half a
century before.  So she sent a fleet to encourage or compel Rome to
continue the struggle, and she cut the overseas communications of
Pyrrhus. Pyrrhus found himself freshly assailed by the Romans, and
suffered a disastrous repulse in an attack he had made upon their camp
at Beneventum between Naples and Rome.

And suddenly came news that recalled him to Epirus.  The Gauls were
raiding south.  But this time they were not raiding down into Italy;
the Roman frontier, fortified and guarded, had become too formidable
for them.  They were raiding down through Illyria (which is now Serbia
and Albania) to Macedonia and Epirus.  Repulsed by the Romans,
endangered at sea by the Carthaginians, and threatened at home by the
Gauls, Pyrrhus abandoned his dream of conquest and went home (275
B.C.), and the power of Rome was extended to the Straits of Messina.

On the Sicilian side of the Straits was the Greek city of Messina, and
this presently fell into the hands of a gang of pirates.  The
Carthaginians, who were already practically overlords of Sicily and
allies of Syracuse, suppressed these pirates (270 B.C.) and put in a
Carthaginian garrison there.  The pirates appealed to Rome and Rome
listened to their complaint.  And so across the Straits of Messina the
great trading power of Carthage and this new conquering people, the
Romans, found themselves in antagonism, face to face.




XXXII
ROME AND CARTHAGE


It was in 264 B.C. that the great struggle between Rome and Carthage,
the Punic Wars, began. In that year Asoka was beginning his reign in
Behar and Shi- Hwang-ti was a little child, the Museum in Alexandria
was still doing good scientific work, and the barbaric Gauls were now
in Asia Minor and exacting a tribute from Pergamum. The different
regions of the world were still separated by insurmountable distances,
and probably the rest of mankind heard only vague and remote rumours of
the mortal fight that went on for a century and a half in Spain, Italy,
North Africa and the western Mediterranean, between the last stronghold
of Semitic power and Rome, this newcomer among Aryan-speaking peoples.

That war has left its traces upon issues that still stir the world. 
Rome triumphed over Carthage, but the rivalry of Aryan and Semite was
to merge itself later on in the conflict of Gentile and Jew.  Our
history now is coming to events whose consequences and distorted
traditions still maintain a lingering and expiring vitality in, and
exercise a complicating and confusing influence upon, the conflicts and
controversies of to-day.

The First Punic War began in 264 B.C. about the pirates of Messina.  It
developed into a struggle for the possession of all Sicily except the
dominions of the Greek king of Syracuse.  The advantage of the sea was
at first with the Carthaginians.  They had great fighting ships of what
was hitherto an unheard-of size, quinqueremes, galleys with five banks
of oars and a huge ram.  At the battle of Salamis, two centuries
before, the leading battleships had only been triremes with three
banks.  But the Romans, with extraordinary energy and in spite of the
fact that they had little naval experience, set themselves to outbuild
the Carthaginians.  They manned the new navy they created chiefly with
Greek seamen, and they invented grappling and boarding to make up for
the superior seamanship of the enemy. When the Carthaginian came up to
ram or shear the oars of the Roman, huge grappling irons seized him and
the Roman soldiers swarmed aboard him.  At Mylæ (260 B.C.) and at
Ecnomus (256 B.C.) the Carthaginians were disastrously beaten. They
repulsed a Roman landing near Carthage but were badly beaten at
Palermo, losing one hundred and four elephants there—to grace such a
triumphal procession through the Forum as Rome had never seen before. 
But after that came two Roman defeats and then a Roman recovery.  The
last naval forces of Carthage were defeated by it last Roman effort at
the battle of the Ægatian Isles (241 B.C.) and Carthage sued for peace.
 All Sicily except the dominions of Hiero, king of Syracuse, was ceded
to the Romans.


HANNIBAL

For twenty-two years Rome and Carthage kept the peace.  Both had
trouble enough at home.  In Italy the Gauls came south again,
threatened Rome—_which in a state of panic offered human sacrifices to
the Gods!_—and were routed at Telamon.  Rome pushed forward to the
Alps, and even extended her dominions down the Adriatic coast to
Illyria. Carthage suffered from domestic insurrections and from revolts
in Corsica and Sardinia, and displayed far less recuperative power. 
Finally, an act of intolerable aggression, Rome seized and annexed the
two revolting islands.

Spain at that time was Carthaginian as far north as the river Ebro.  To
that boundary the Romans restricted them.  Any crossing of the Ebro by
the Carthaginians was to be considered an act of war against the
Romans.  At last in 218 B.C. the Carthaginians, provoked by new Roman
aggressions, did cross this river under a young general named Hannibal,
one of the most brilliant commanders in the whole of history.  He
marched his army from Spain over the Alps into Italy, raised the Gauls
against the Romans, and carried on the Second Punic War in Italy itself
for fifteen years.  He inflicted tremendous defeats upon the Romans at
Lake Trasimere and at Cannæ, and throughout all his Italian campaigns
no Roman army stood against him and escaped disaster.  But a Roman army
had landed at Marseilles and cut his communications with Spain; he had
no siege train, and he could never capture Rome.  Finally the
Carthaginians, threatened by the revolt of the Numidians at home, were
forced back upon the defence of their own city in Africa, a Roman army
crossed into Africa, and Hannibal experienced his first defeat under
its walls at the battle of Zama (202 B.C. at the hands of Scipio
Africanus the Elder.  The battle of Zama ended this Second Punic War.
Carthage capitulated; she surrendered Spain and her war fleet; she paid
an enormous indemnity and agreed to give up Hannibal to the vengeance
of the Romans.  But Hannibal escaped and fled to Asia where later,
being in danger of falling into the hands of his relentless enemies, he
took poison and died.

For fifty-six years Rome and the shorn city of Carthage were at peace. 
And meanwhile Rome spread her empire over confused and divided Greece,
invaded Asia Minor, and defeated Antiochus III, the Seleucid monarch,
at Magnesia in Lydia. She made Egypt, still under the Ptolemies, and
Pergamum and most of the small states of Asia Minor into “Allies,” or,
as we should call them now, “protected states.”

Meanwhile Carthage, subjugated and enfeebled, had been slowly regaining
something of her former prosperity.  Her recovery revived the hate and
suspicion of the Romans.  She was attacked upon the most shallow and
artificial of quarrels (149 B.C.), she made an obstinate and bitter
resistance, stood a long siege and was stormed (146 B.C.). The street
fighting, or massacre, lasted six days; it was extraordinarily bloody,
and when the citadel capitulated only about fifty thousand of the
Carthaginian population remained alive out of a quarter of a million. 
They were sold into slavery, and the city was burnt and elaborately
destroyed.  The blackened ruins were ploughed and sown as a sort of
ceremonial effacement.

So ended the Third Punic War.  Of all the Semitic states and cities
that had flourished in the world five centuries before only one little
country remained free under native rulers. This was Judea, which had
liberated itself from the Seleucids and was under the rule of the
native Maccabean princes. By this time it had its Bible almost
complete, and was developing the distinctive traditions of the Jewish
world as we know it now.  It was natural that the Carthaginians,
Phoenicians and kindred peoples dispersed about the world should find a
common link in their practically identical language and in this
literature of hope and courage.  To a large extent they were still the
traders and bankers of the world.  The Semitic world had been submerged
rather than replaced.

Jerusalem, which has always been rather the symbol than the centre of
Judaism, was taken by the Romans in 65 B.C.; and after various
vicissitudes of quasi- independence and revolt was besieged by them in
70 A.D. and captured after a stubborn struggle. The Temple was
destroyed.  A later rebellion in 132 A.D. completed its destruction,
and the Jerusalem we know to-day was rebuilt later under Roman
auspices.  A temple to the Roman god, Jupiter Capitolinus, stood in the
place of the Temple, and Jews were forbidden to inhabit the city.




XXXIII
THE GROWTH OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE


Now this new Roman power which arose to dominate the western world in
the second and first centuries B.C. was in several respects a different
thing from any of the great empires that had hitherto prevailed in the
civilized world. It was not at first a monarchy, and it was not the
creation of any one great conqueror. It was not indeed the first of
republican empires; Athens had dominated a group of Allies and
dependents in the time of Pericles, and Carthage when she entered upon
her fatal struggle with Rome was mistress of Sardinia and Corsica,
Morocco, Algiers, Tunis, and most of Spain and Sicily. But it was the
first republican empire that escaped extinction and went on to fresh
developments.

The centre of this new system lay far to the west of the more ancient
centres of empire, which had hitherto been the river valleys of
Mesopotamia and Egypt.  This westward position enabled Rome to bring in
to civilization quite fresh regions and peoples. The Roman power
extended to Morocco and Spain, and was presently able to thrust
north-westward over what is now France and Belgium to Britain and
north-eastward into Hungary and South Russia.  But on the other hand it
was never able to maintain itself in Central Asia or Persia because
they were too far from its administrative centres.  It included
therefore great masses of fresh Nordic Aryan- speaking peoples, it
presently incorporated nearly all the Greek people in the world, and
its population was less strongly Hamitic and Semitic than that of any
preceding empire.

For some centuries this Roman Empire did not fall into the grooves of
precedent that had so speedily swallowed up Persian and Greek, and all
that time it developed.  The rulers of the Medes and Persians became
entirely Babylonized in a generation or so; they took over the tiara of
the king of kings and the temples and priesthoods of his gods;
Alexander and his successors followed in the same easy path of
assimilation; the Seleucid monarchs had much the same court and
administrative methods as Nebuchadnezzar; the Ptolemies became Pharaohs
and altogether Egyptian.  They were assimilated just as before them the
Semitic conquerors of the Sumerians had been assimilated.  But the
Romans ruled in their own city, and for some centuries kept to the laws
of their own nature.  The only people who exercised any great mental
influence upon them before the second or third century A.D. were the
kindred and similar Greeks.  So that the Roman Empire was essentially a
first attempt to rule a great dominion upon mainly Aryan lines.  It was
so far a new pattern in history, it was an expanded Aryan republic. 
The old pattern of a personal conqueror ruling over a capital city that
had grown up round the temple of a harvest god did not apply to it. 
The Romans had gods and temples, but like the gods of the Greeks their
gods were quasi-human immortals, divine patricians.  The Romans also
had blood sacrifices and even made human ones in times of stress,
things they may have learnt to do from their dusky Etruscan teachers;
but until Rome was long past its zenith neither priest nor temple
played a large part in Roman history.

The Roman Empire was a growth, an unplanned novel growth; the Roman
people found themselves engaged almost unawares in a vast
administrative experiment.  It cannot be called a successful
experiment.  In the end their empire collapsed altogether.  And it
changed enormously in form and method from century to century.  It
changed more in a hundred years than Bengal or Mesopotamia or Egypt
changed in a thousand. It was always changing.  It never attained to
any fixity.

In a sense the experiment failed.  In a sense the experiment remains
unfinished, and Europe and America to-day are still working out the
riddles of world-wide statescraft first confronted by the Roman people.

It is well for the student of history to bear in mind the very great
changes not only in political but in social and moral matters that went
on throughout the period of Roman dominion.  There is much too strong a
tendency in people’s minds to think of the Roman rule as something
finished and stable, firm, rounded, noble and decisive.  Macaulay’s
_Lays of Ancient Rome_, S.P.Q.R. the elder Cato, the Scipios, Julius
Cæsar, Diocletian, Constantine the Great, triumphs, orations,
gladiatorial combats and Christian martyrs are all mixed up together in
a picture of something high and cruel and dignified.  The items of that
picture have to be disentangled.  They are collected at different
points from a process of change profounder than that which separates
the London of William the Conqueror from the London of to-day.

We may very conveniently divide the expansion of Rome into four stages.
 The first stage began after the sack of Rome by the Goths in 390 B.C.
and went on until the end of the First Punic War (240 B.C,).  We may
call this stage the stage of the Assimilative Republic.  It was perhaps
the finest, most characteristic stage in Roman history.  The age-long
dissensions of patrician and plebeian were drawing to it close, the
Etruscan threat had come to an end, no one was very rich yet nor very
poor, and most men were public-spirited.  It was a republic like the
republic of the South African Boers before 1900 or like the northern
states of the American union between 1800 and 1850; a free- farmers
republic.  At the outset of this stage Rome was a little state scarcely
twenty miles square.  She fought the sturdy but kindred states about
her, and sought not their destruction but coalescence.  Her centuries
of civil dissension had trained her people in compromise and
concessions.  Some of the defeated cities became altogether Roman with
a voting share in the government, some became self-governing with the
right to trade and marry in Rome; garrisons full of citizens were set
up at strategic points and colonies of varied privileges founded among
the freshly conquered people.  Great roads were made.  The rapid
Latinization of all Italy was the inevitable consequence of such a
policy.  In 89 B.C. all the free inhabitants of Italy became citizens
of the city of Rome.  Formally the whole Roman Empire became at last an
extended city.  In 212 A.D. every free man in the entire extent of the
empire was given citizenship; the right, if he could get there, to vote
in the town meeting in Rome.

This extension of citizenship to tractable cities and to whole
countries was the distinctive device of Roman expansion.  It reversed
the old process of conquest and assimilation altogether.  By the Roman
method the conquerors assimilated the conquered.


THE FORUM AT ROME AS IT IS TO-DAY
THE FORUM AT ROME AS IT IS TO-DAY


But after the First Punic War and the annexation of Sicily, though the
old process of assimilation still went on, another process arose by its
side.  Sicily for instance was treated as a conquered prey.  It was
declared an “estate” of the Roman people.  Its rich soil and
industrious population was exploited to make Rome rich.  The patricians
and the more influential among the plebeians secured the major share of
that wealth.  And the war also brought in a large supply of slaves. 
Before the First Punic War the population of the republic had been
largely a population of citizen farmers.  Military service was their
privilege and liability.  While they were on active service their farms
fell into debt and a new large-scale slave agriculture grew up; when
they returned they found their produce in competition with slave-grown
produce from Sicily and from the new estates at home.  Times had
changed.  The republic had altered its character.  Not only was Sicily
in the hands of Rome, the common man was in the hands of the rich
creditor and the rich competitor.  Rome had entered upon its second
stage, the Republic of Adventurous Rich Men.

For two hundred years the Roman soldier farmers had struggled for
freedom and a share in the government of their state; for a hundred
years they had enjoyed their privileges.  The First Punic War wasted
them and robbed them of all they had won.

The value of their electoral privileges had also evaporated. The
governing bodies of the Roman republic were two in number.  The first
and more important was the Senate.  This was a body originally of
patricians and then of prominent men of all sorts, who were summoned to
it first by certain powerful officials, the consuls and censors.  Like
the British House of Lords it became a gathering of great landowners,
prominent politicians, big business men and the like. It was much more
like the British House of Lords than it was like the American Senate. 
For three centuries, from the Punic Wars onward, it was the centre of
Roman political thought and purpose.  The second body was the Popular
Assembly.  This was supposed to be an assembly of _all_ the citizens of
Rome.  When Rome was a little state twenty miles square this was a
possible gathering.  When the citizenship of Rome had spread beyond the
confines in Italy, it was an altogether impossible one.  Its meetings,
proclaimed by horn-blowing from the Capitol and the city walls, became
more and more a gathering of political hacks and city riff-raff.  In
the fourth century B.C. the Popular Assembly was a considerable check
upon the Senate, a competent representation of the claims and rights of
the common man.  By the end of the Punic Wars it was an impotent relic
of a vanquished popular control.  No effectual legal check remained
upon the big men.

Nothing of the nature of representative government was ever introduced
into the Roman republic.  No one thought of electing delegates to
represent the will of the citizens. This is a very important point for
the student to grasp.  The Popular Assembly never became the equivalent
of the American House of Representatives or the British House of
Commons.  In theory it was all the citizens; in practice it ceased to
be anything at all worth consideration.

The common citizen of the Roman Empire was therefore in a very poor
case after the Second Punic War; he was impoverished, he had often lost
his farm, he was ousted from profitable production by slaves, and he
had no political power left to him to remedy these things.  The only
methods of popular expression left to a people without any form of
political expression are the strike and the revolt.  The story of the
second and first centuries B.C., so far as internal politics go, is a
story of futile revolutionary upheaval.  The scale of this history will
not permit us to tell of the intricate struggles of that time, of the
attempts to break up estates and restore the land to the free farmer,
of proposals to abolish debts in whole or in part.  There was revolt
and civil war.  In 73 B.C., the distresses of Italy were enhanced by a
great insurrection, of the slaves under Spartacus.  The slaves of Italy
revolted with some effect, for among them were the trained fighters of
the gladiatorial shows.  For two years Spartacus held out in the crater
of Vesuvius, which seemed at that time to be an extinct volcano. This
insurrection was defeated at last and suppressed with frantic cruelty. 
Six thousand captured Spartacists were crucified along the Appian Way,
the great highway that runs southward out of Rome (71 B.C.).

The common man never made head against the forces that were subjugating
and degrading him.  But the big rich men who were overcoming him were
even in his defeat preparing a new power in the Roman world over
themselves and him, the power of the army.

Before the Second Punic War the army of Rome was a levy of free
farmers, who, according to their quality, rode or marched afoot to
battle.  This was a very good force for wars close at hand, but not the
sort of army that will go abroad and bear long campaigns with patience.
 And moreover as the slaves multiplied and the estates grew, the supply
of free- spirited fighting farmers declined.  It was a popular leader
named Marius who introduced a new factor.  North Africa after the
overthrow of the Carthaginian civilization had become a semi-barbaric
kingdom, the kingdom of Numidia.  The Roman power fell into conflict
with Jugurtha, king of this state, and experienced enormous
difficulties in subduing him. Marius was made consul, in a phase of
public indignation, to end this discreditable war.  This he did by
raising _paid troops_ and drilling them hard.  Jugurtha was brought in
chains to Rome (106 B.C.) and Marius, when his time of office had
expired, held on to his consulship illegally with his newly created
legions.  There was no power in Rome to restrain him.

With Marius began the third phase in the development of the Roman
power, the Republic of the Military Commanders.  For now began a period
in which the leaders of the paid legions fought for the mastery of the
Roman world.  Against Marius was pitted the aristocratic Sulla who had
served under him in Africa.  Each in turn made a great massacre of his
political opponents.  Men were proscribed and executed by the thousand,
and their estates were sold.  After the bloody rivalry of these two and
the horror of the revolt of Spartacus, came a phase in which Lucullus
and Pompey the Great and Crassus and Julius Cæsar were the masters of
armies and dominated affairs.  It was Crassus who defeated Spartacus. 
Lucullus conquered Asia Minor and penetrated to Armenia, and retired
with great wealth into private life.  Crassus thrusting further invaded
Persia and was defeated and slain by the Parthians.  After a long
rivalry Pompey was defeated by Julius Cæsar (48 B.C.) and murdered in
Egypt, leaving Julius Cæsar sole master of the Roman world.

The figure of Julius Cæsar is one that has stirred the human
imagination out of all proportion to its merit or true importance.  He
has become a legend and a symbol.  For us he is chiefly important as
marking the transition from the phase of military adventurers to the
beginning of the fourth stage in Roman expansion, the Early Empire. 
For in spite of the profoundest economic and political convulsions, in
spite of civil war and social degeneration, throughout all this time
the boundaries of the Roman state crept outward and continued to creep
outward to their maximum about 100 A.D.  There had been something like
an ebb during the doubtful phases of the Second Punic War, and again a
manifest loss of vigour before the reconstruction of the army by
Marius. The revolt of Spartacus marked a third phase.  Julius Cæsar
made his reputation as a military leader in Gaul, which is now France
and Belgium.  (The chief tribes inhabiting this country belonged to the
same Celtic people as the Gauls who had occupied north Italy for a
time, and who had afterwards raided into Asia Minor and settled down as
the Galatians.)  Cæsar drove back a German invasion of Gaul and added
all that country to the empire, and he twice crossed the Straits of
Dover into Britain (55 and 54 B.C.), where however he made no permanent
conquest.  Meanwhile Pompey the Great was consolidating Roman conquests
that reached in the east to the Caspian Sea.

At this time, the middle of the first century B.C., the Roman Senate
was still the nominal centre of the Roman government, appointing
consuls and other officials, granting powers and the like; and a number
of politicians, among whom Cicero was an outstanding figure, were
struggling to preserve the great traditions of republican Rome and to
maintain respect for its laws.  But the spirit of citizenship had gone
from Italy with the wasting away of the free farmers; it was a land now
of slaves and impoverished men with neither the understanding nor the
desire for freedom.  There was nothing whatever behind these republican
leaders in the Senate, while behind the great adventurers they feared
and desired to control were the legions.  Over the heads of the Senate
Crassus and Pompey and Cæsar divided the rule of the Empire between
them (The First Triumvirate).  When presently Crassus was killed at
distant Carrhæ by the Parthians, Pompey and Cæsar fell out. Pompey took
up the republican side, and laws were passed to bring Cæsar to trial
for his breaches of law and his disobedience to the decrees of the
Senate.

It was illegal for a general to bring his troops out of the boundary of
his command, and the boundary between Cæsar’s command and Italy was the
Rubicon.  In 49 B.C. he crossed the Rubicon, saying “The die is cast”
and marched upon Pompey and Rome.

It had been the custom in Rome in the past, in periods of military
extremity, to elect a “dictator” with practically unlimited powers to
rule through the crisis. After his overthrow of Pompey, Cæsar was made
dictator first for ten years and then (in 45 B.C.) for life.  In effect
he was made monarch of the empire for life.  There was talk of a king,
a word abhorrent to Rome since the expulsion of the Etruscans five
centuries before.  Cæsar refused to be king, but adopted throne and
sceptre.  After his defeat of Pompey, Cæsar had gone on into Egypt and
had made love to Cleopatra, the last of the Ptolemies, the goddess
queen of Egypt.  She seems to have turned his head very completely.  He
had brought back to Rome the Egyptian idea of a god-king.  His statue
was set up in a temple with an inscription “To the Unconquerable God.” 
The expiring republicanism of Rome flared up in a last protest, and
Cæsar was stabbed to death in the Senate at the foot of the statue of
his murdered rival, Pompey the Great.

Thirteen years more of this conflict of ambitious personalities
followed.  There was a second Triumvirate of Lepidus, Mark Antony and
Octavian Cæsar, the latter the nephew of Julius Cæsar.  Octavian like
his uncle took the poorer, hardier western provinces where the best
legions were recruited.  In 31 B.C., he defeated Mark Antony, his only
serious rival, at the naval battle of Actium, and made himself sole
master of the Roman world.  But Octavian was a man of different quality
altogether from Julius Cæsar.  He had no foolish craving to be God or
King.  He had no queen-lover that he wished to dazzle.  He restored
freedom to the Senate and people of Rome.  He declined to be dictator. 
The grateful Senate in return gave him the reality instead of the forms
of power. He was to be called not King indeed, but “Princeps” and
“Augustus.”  He became Augustus Cæsar, the first of the Roman emperors
(27 B.C. to 14 A.D.).

He was followed by Tiberius Cæsar (14 to 37 A.D.) and he by others,
Caligula, Claudius, Nero and so on up to Trajan (98 A.D.), Hadrian (117
A.D.), Antonius Pius (138 A.D.) and Marcus Aurelius (161- 180 A.D.). 
All these emperors were emperors of the legions.  The soldiers made
them, and some the soldiers destroyed.  Gradually the Senate fades out
of Roman-history, and the emperor and his administrative officials
replace it.  The boundaries of the empire crept forward now to their
utmost limits.  Most of Britain was added to the empire, Transylvania
was brought in as a new province, Dacia; Trajan crossed the Euphrates. 
Hadrian had an idea that reminds us at once of what had happened at the
other end of the old world.  Like Shi-Hwang-ti he built walls against
the northern barbarians; one across Britain and a palisade between the
Rhine and the Danube.  He abandoned some of the acquisitions of Trajan.

The expansion of the Roman Empire was at an end.




XXXIV
BETWEEN ROME AND CHINA


The second and first centuries B.C. mark a new phase in the history of
mankind. Mesopotamia and the eastern Mediterranean are no longer the
centre of interest. Both Mesopotamia and Egypt were still fertile,
populous and fairly prosperous, but they were no longer the dominant
regions of the world. Power had drifted to the west and to the east.
Two great empires now dominated the world, this new Roman Empire and
the renascent Empire of China. Rome extended its power to the
Euphrates, but it was never able to get beyond that boundary. It was
too remote. Beyond the Euphrates the former Persian and Indian
dominions of the Seleucids fell under a number of new masters. China,
now under the Han dynasty, which had replaced the Ts’in dynasty at the
death of Shi-Hwang-ti, had extended its power across Tibet and over the
high mountain passes of the Pamirs into western Turkestan. But there,
too, it reached its extremes. Beyond was too far.

China at this time was the greatest, best organized and most civilized
political system in the world.  It was superior in area and population
to the Roman Empire at its zenith.  It was possible then for these two
vast systems to flourish in the same world at the same time in almost
complete ignorance of each other.  The means of communication both by
sea and land was not yet sufficiently developed and organized for them
to come to a direct clash.

Yet they reacted upon each other in a very remarkable way, and their
influence upon the fate of the regions that lay between them, upon
central Asia and India, was profound.  A certain amount of trade
trickled through, by camel caravans across Persia, for example, and by
coasting ships by way of India and the Red Sea.  In 66 B.C. Roman
troops under Pompey followed in the footsteps of Alexander the Great,
and marched up the eastern shores of the Caspian Sea.  In 102 A.D. a
Chinese expeditionary force under Pan Chau reached the Caspian, and
sent emissaries to report upon the power of Rome.  But many centuries
were still to pass before definite knowledge and direct intercourse
were to link the great parallel worlds of Europe and Eastern Asia.

To the north of both these great empires were barbaric wildernesses. 
What is now Germany was largely forest lands; the forests extended far
into Russia and made a home for the gigantic aurochs, a bull of almost
elephantine size.  Then to the north of the great mountain masses of
Asia stretched a band of deserts, steppes and then forests and frozen
lands. In the eastward lap of the elevated part of Asia was the great
triangle of Manchuria.  Large parts of these regions, stretching
between South Russia and Turkestan into Manchuria, were and are regions
of exceptional climatic insecurity. Their rainfall has varied greatly
in the course of a few centuries  They are lands treacherous to man. 
For years they will carry pasture and sustain cultivation, and then
will come an age of decline in humidity and a cycle of killing
droughts.

The western part of this barbaric north from the German forests to
South Russia and Turkestan and from Gothland to the Alps was the region
of origin of the Nordic peoples and of the Aryan speech.  The eastern
steppes and deserts of Mongolia was the region of origin of the Hunnish
or Mongolian or Tartar or Turkish peoples—for all these several peoples
were akin in language, race, and way of life.  And as the Nordic
peoples seem to have been continually overflowing their own borders and
pressing south upon the developing civilizations of Mesopotamia and the
Mediterranean coast, so the Hunnish tribes sent their surplus as
wanderers, raiders and conquerors into the settled regions of China. 
Periods of plenty in the north would mean an increase in population
there; a shortage of grass, a spell of cattle disease, would drive the
hungry warlike tribesmen south.

For a time there were simultaneously two fairly effective Empires in
the world capable of holding back the barbarians and even forcing
forward the frontiers of the imperial peace. The thrust of the Han
empire from north China into Mongolia was strong and continuous.  The
Chinese population welled up over the barrier of the Great Wall. 
Behind the imperial frontier guards came the Chinese farmer with horse
and plough, ploughing up the grass lands and enclosing the winter
pasture.  The Hunnish peoples raided and murdered the settlers, but the
Chinese punitive expeditions were too much for them.  The nomads were
faced with the choice of settling down to the plough and becoming
Chinese tax-payers or shifting in search of fresh summer pastures. 
Some took the former course and were absorbed.  Some drifted
north-eastward and eastward over the mountain passes down into western
Turkestan.

This westward drive of the Mongolian horsemen was going on from 200
B.C. onward.  It was producing a westward pressure upon the Aryan
tribes, and these again were pressing upon the Roman frontiers ready to
break through directly there was any weakness apparent.  The Parthians,
who were apparently a Scythian people with some Mongolian admixture,
came down to the Euphrates by the first century B.C.  They fought
against Pompey the Great in his eastern raid.  They defeated and killed
Crassus.  They replaced the Seleucid monarchy in Persia by a dynasty of
Parthian kings, the Arsacid dynasty.

But for a time the line of least resistance for hungry nomads lay
neither to the west nor the east but through central Asia and then
south-eastward through the Khyber Pass into India. It was India which
received the Mongolian drive in these centuries of Roman and Chinese
strength.  A series of raiding conquerors poured down through the
Punjab into the great plains to loot and destroy.  The empire of Asoka
was broken up, and for a time the history of India passes into
darkness. A certain Kushan dynasty founded by the “Indo- Scythians”—one
of the raiding peoples—ruled for a time over North India and maintained
a certain order. These invasions went on for several centuries.  For a
large part of the fifth century A.D. India was afflicted by the
Ephthalites or White Huns, who levied tribute on the small Indian
princes and held India in terror. Every summer these Ephthalites
pastured in western Turkestan, every autumn they came down through the
passes to terrorize India.

In the second century A.D. a great misfortune came upon the Roman and
Chinese empires that probably weakened the resistance of both to
barbarian pressure.  This was a pestilence of unexampled virulence.  It
raged for eleven years in China and disorganized the social framework
profoundly.  The Han dynasty fell, and a new age of division and
confusion began from which China did not fairly recover until the
seventh century A.D. with the coming of the great Tang dynasty.

The infection spread through Asia to Europe.  It raged throughout the
Roman Empire from 164 to 180 A.D.  It evidently weakened the Roman
imperial fabric very seriously.  We begin to hear of depopulation in
the Roman provinces after this, and there was a marked deterioration in
the vigour and efficiency of government.  At any rate we presently find
the frontier no longer invulnerable, but giving way first in this place
and then in that.  A new Nordic people, the Goths, coming originally
from Gothland in Sweden, had migrated across Russia to the Volga region
and the shores of the Black Sea and taken to the sea and piracy.  By
the end of the second century they may have begun to feel the westward
thrust of the Huns.  In 247 they crossed the Danube in a great land
raid, and defeated and killed the Emperor Decius in a battle in what is
now Serbia. In 236 another Germanic people, the Franks, had broken
bounds upon the lower Rhine, and the Alemanni had poured into Alsace. 
The legions in Gaul beat back their invaders, but the Goths in the
Balkan peninsula raided again and again. The province of Dacia vanished
from Roman history.

A chill had come to the pride and confidence of Rome.  In 270-275 Rome,
which had been an open and secure city for three centuries, was
fortified by the Emperor Aurelian.




XXXV
THE COMMON MAN’S LIFE UNDER THE EARLY ROMAN EMPIRE


Before we tell of how this Roman empire which was built up in the two
centuries B.C., and which flourished in peace and security from the
days of Augustus Cæsar onward for two centuries, fell into disorder and
was broken up, it may be as well to devote some attention to the life
of the ordinary people throughout this great realm. Our history has
come down now to within 2000 years of our own time; and the life of the
civilized people, both under the Peace of Rome and the Peace of the Han
dynasty, was beginning to resemble more and more clearly the life of
their civilized successors to-day.

In the western world coined money was now in common use; outside the
priestly world there were many people of independent means who were
neither officials of the government nor priests; people travelled about
more freely than they had ever done before, and there were high roads
and inns for them. Compared with the past, with the time before 500
B.C., life had become much more loose. Before that date civilized men
had been bound to a district or country, had been bound to a tradition
and lived within a very limited horizon; only the nomads traded and
travelled.

But neither the Roman Peace nor the Peace of the Han dynasty meant a
uniform civilization over the large areas they controlled.  There were
very great local differences and great contrasts and inequalities of
culture between one district and another, just as there are to-day
under the British Peace in India.  The Roman garrisons and colonies
were dotted here and there over this great space, worshipping Roman
gods and speaking the Latin language; but where there had been towns
and cities before the coming of the Romans, they went on, subordinated
indeed but managing their own affairs, and, for a time at least,
worshipping their own gods in their own fashion.  Over Greece, Asia
Minor, Egypt and the Hellenized East generally, the Latin language
never prevailed.  Greek ruled there invincibly.  Saul of Tarsus, who
became the apostle Paul, was a Jew and a Roman citizen; but he spoke
and wrote Greek and not Hebrew.  Even at the court of the Parthian
dynasty, which had overthrown the Greek Seleucids in Persia, and was
quite outside the Roman imperial boundaries, Greek was the fashionable
language.  In some parts of Spain and in North Africa, the Carthaginian
language also held on for a long time in spite of the destruction of
Carthage.  Such a town as Seville, which had been a prosperous city
long before the Roman name had been heard of, kept its Semitic goddess
and preserved its Semitic speech for generations, in spite of a colony
of Roman veterans at Italica a few miles away.  Septimius Severus, who
was emperor from 193 to 211 A.D., spoke Carthaginian as his mother
speech.  He learnt Latin later as a foreign tongue; and it is recorded
that his sister never learnt Latin and conducted her Roman household in
the Punic language.


A Gladiator (contemporary representation)

In such countries as Gaul and Britain and in provinces like Dacia (now
roughly Roumania) and Pannonia (Hungary south of the Danube), where
there were no pre-existing great cities and temples and cultures, the
Roman empire did however “Latinize.”  It civilized these countries for
the first time.  It created cities and towns where Latin was from the
first the dominant speech, and where Roman gods were served and Roman
customs and fashions followed.  The Roumanian, Italian, French and
Spanish languages, all variations and modifications of Latin, remain to
remind us of this extension of Latin speech and customs.  North-west
Africa also became at last largely Latin-speaking.  Egypt, Greece and
the rest of the empire to the east were never Latinized.  They remained
Egyptian and Greek in culture and spirit.  And even in Rome, among
educated men, Greek was learnt as the language of a gentleman and Greek
literature and learning were very, properly preferred to Latin.

In this miscellaneous empire the ways of doing work and business were
naturally also very miscellaneous.  The chief industry of the settled
world was still largely agriculture. We have told how in Italy the
sturdy free farmers who were the backbone of the early Roman republic
were replaced by estates worked by slave labour after the Punic wars. 
The Greek world had had very various methods of cultivation, from the
Arcadian plan, wherein every free citizen toiled with his own hands, to
Sparta, wherein it was a dishonour to work and where agricultural work
was done by a special slave class, the Helots.  But that was ancient
history now, and over most of the Hellenized world the estate system
and slave-gangs had spread.  The agricultural slaves were captives who
spoke many different languages so that they could not understand each
other, or they were born slaves; they had no solidarity to resist
oppression, no tradition of rights, no knowledge, for they could not
read nor write.  Although they came to form a majority of the country
population they never made a successful insurrection.  The insurrection
of Spartacus in the first century B.C. was an insurrection of the
special slaves who were trained for the gladiatorial combats. The
agricultural workers in Italy in the latter days of the Republic and
the early Empire suffered frightful indignities; they would be chained
at night to prevent escape or have half the head shaved to make it
difficult.  They had no wives of their own; they could be outraged,
mutilated and killed by their masters.  A master could sell his slave
to fight beasts in the arena.  If a slave slew his master, all the
slaves in his household and not merely the murderer were crucified.  In
some parts of Greece, in Athens notably, the lot of the slave was never
quite so frightful as this, but it was still detestable.  To such a
population the barbarian invaders who presently broke through the
defensive line of the legions, came not as enemies but as liberators.

The slave system had spread to most industries and to every sort of
work that could be done by gangs.  Mines and metallurgical operations,
the rowing of galleys, road-making and big building operations were all
largely slave occupations.  And almost all domestic service was
performed by slaves.  There were poor free-men and there were freed-men
in the cities and upon the country side, working for themselves or even
working for wages.  They were artizans, supervisors and so forth,
workers of a new money- paid class working in competition with slave
workers; but we do not know what proportion they made of the general
population.  It probably varied widely in different places and at
different periods.  And there were also many modifications of slavery,
from the slavery that was chained at night and driven with whips to the
farm or quarry, to the slave whose master found it advantageous to
leave him to cultivate his patch or work his craft and own his wife
like a free-man, provided he paid in a satisfactory quittance to his
owner.

There were armed slaves.  At the opening of the period of the Punic
wars, in 264 B.C., the Etruscan sport of setting slaves to fight for
their lives was revived in Rome.  It grew rapidly fashionable; and soon
every great Roman rich man kept a retinue of gladiators, who sometimes
fought in the arena but whose real business it was to act as his
bodyguard of bullies.  And also there were learned slaves.  The
conquests of the later Republic were among the highly civilized cities
of Greece, North Africa and Asia Minor; and they brought in many highly
educated captives. The tutor of a young Roman of good family was
usually a slave.  A rich man would have a Greek slave as librarian, and
slave secretaries and learned men.  He would keep his poet as he would
keep a performing dog.  In this atmosphere of slavery the traditions of
modern literary criticism were evolved.  The slaves still boast and
quarrel in our reviews. There were enterprising people who bought
intelligent boy slaves and had them educated for sale.  Slaves were
trained as book copyists, as jewellers, and for endless skilled
callings.

But there were very considerable changes in the position of a slave
during the four hundred years between the opening days of conquest
under the republic of rich men and the days of disintegration that
followed the great pestilence.  In the second century B.C. war-captives
were abundant, manners gross and brutal; the slave had no rights and
there was scarcely an outrage the reader can imagine that was not
practised upon slaves in those days.  But already in the first century
A.D. there was a perceptible improvement in the attitude of the Roman
civilization towards slavery.  Captives were not so abundant for one
thing, and slaves were dearer.  And slave- owners began to realize that
the profit and comfort they got from their slaves increased with the
self-respect of these unfortunates.  But also the moral tone of the
community was rising, and a sense of justice was becoming effective. 
The higher mentality of Greece was qualifying the old Roman harshness. 
Restrictions upon cruelty were made, a master might no longer sell his
slave to fight beasts, a slave was given property rights in what was
called his _peculium_, slaves were paid wages as an encouragement and
stimulus, a form of slave marriage was recognized.  Very many forms of
agriculture do not lend themselves to gang working, or require gang
workers only at certain seasons.  In regions where such conditions
prevailed the slave presently became a serf, paying his owner part of
his produce or working for him at certain seasons.

When we begin to realize how essentially this great Latin and
Greek-speaking Roman Empire of the first two centuries A.D. was a slave
state and how small was the minority who had any pride or freedom in
their lives, we lay our hands on the clues to its decay and collapse. 
There was little of what we should call family life, few homes of
temperate living and active thought and study; schools and colleges
were few and far between.  The free will and the free mind were nowhere
to be found.  The great roads, the ruins of splendid buildings, the
tradition of law and power it left for the astonishment of succeeding
generations must not conceal from us that all its outer splendour was
built upon thwarted wills, stifled intelligence, and crippled and
perverted desires.  And even the minority who lorded it over that wide
realm of subjugation and of restraint and forced labour were uneasy and
unhappy in their souls; art and literature, science and philosophy,
which are the fruits of free and happy minds, waned in that atmosphere.
 There was much copying and imitation, an abundance of artistic
artificers, much slavish pedantry among the servile men of learning,
but the whole Roman empire in four centuries produced nothing to set
beside the bold and noble intellectual activities of the comparatively
little city of Athens during its one century of greatness.  Athens
decayed under the Roman sceptre.  The science of Alexandria decayed.
The spirit of man, it seemed, was decaying in those days.




XXXVI
RELIGIOUS DEVELOPMENTS UNDER THE ROMAN EMPIRE


The soul of man under that Latin and Greek empire of the first two
centuries of the Christian era was a worried and frustrated soul.
Compulsion and cruelty reigned; there were pride and display but little
honour; little serenity or steadfast happiness. The unfortunate were
despised and wretched; the fortunate were insecure and feverishly eager
for gratifications. In a great number of cities life centred on the red
excitement of the arena, where men and beasts fought and were tormented
and slain. Amphitheatres are the most characteristic of Roman ruins.
Life went on in that key. The uneasiness of men’s hearts manifested
itself in profound religious unrest.

From the days when the Aryan hordes first broke in upon the ancient
civilizations, it was inevitable that the old gods of the temples and
priesthoods should suffer great adaptations or disappear.  In the
course of hundreds of generations the agricultural peoples of the
brunette civilizations had shaped their lives and thoughts to the
temple-centred life. Observances and the fear of disturbed routines,
sacrifices and mysteries, dominated their minds.  Their gods seem
monstrous and illogical to our modern minds because we belong to an
Aryanized world, but to these older peoples these deities had the
immediate conviction and vividness of things seen in an intense dream. 
The conquest of one city state by another in Sumeria or early Egypt
meant a change or a renaming of gods or goddesses, but left the shape
and spirit of the worship intact.  There was no change in its general
character.  The figures in the dream changed, but the dream went on and
it was the same sort of dream.  And the early Semitic conquerors were
sufficiently akin in spirit to the Sumerians to take over the religion
of the Mesopotamian civilization they subjugated without any profound
alteration. Egypt was never indeed subjugated to the extent of a
religious revolution.  Under the Ptolemies and under the Cæsars, her
temples and altars and priesthoods remained essentially Egyptian.

So long as conquests went on between people of similar social and
religious habits it was possible to get over the clash between the god
of this temple and region and the god of that by a process of grouping
or assimilation.  If the two gods were alike in character they were
identified.  It was really the same god under another name, said the
priests and the people.  This fusion of gods is called theocrasia; and
the age of the great conquests of the thousand years B.C. was an age of
theocrasia.  Over wide areas the local gods were displaced by, or
rather they were swallowed up in, a general god.  So that when at last
Hebrew prophets in Babylon proclaimed one God of Righteousness in all
the earth men’s minds were fully prepared for that idea.

But often the gods were too dissimilar for such an assimilation, and
then they were grouped together in some plausible relationship.  A
female god - and the Ægean world before the coming of the Greek was
much addicted to Mother Gods—would be married to a male god, and an
animal god or a star god would be humanized and the animal or
astronomical aspect, the serpent or the sun or the star, made into an
ornament or a symbol.  Or the god of a defeated people would become a
malignant antagonist to the brighter gods.  The history of theology is
full of such adaptations, compromises and rationalizations of once
local gods.

As Egypt developed from city states into one united kingdom there was
much of this theocrasia.  The chief god so to speak was Osiris, a
sacrificial harvest god of whom Pharaoh was supposed to be the earthly
incarnation.  Osiris was represented as repeatedly dying and rising
again; he was not only the seed and the harvest but also by a natural
extension of thought the means of human immortality.  Among his symbols
was the wide-winged scarabeus beetle which buries its eggs to rise
again, and also the effulgent sun which sets to rise. Later on he was
to be identified with Apis, the sacred bull. Associated with him was
the goddess Isis.  Isis was also Hathor, a cow-goddess, and the
crescent moon and the Star of the sea.  Osiris dies and she bears a
child, Horus, who is also a hawk-god and the dawn, and who grows to
become Osiris again.  The effigies of Isis represent her as bearing the
infant Horus in her arms and standing on the crescent moon.  These are
not logical relationships, but they were devised by the human mind
before the development of hard and systematic thinking and they have a
dream-like coherence.  Beneath this triple group there are other and
darker Egyptian gods, bad gods, the dog-headed Anubis, black night and
the like, devourers, tempters, enemies of god and man.

Every religious system does in the course of time fit itself to the
shape of the human soul, and there can be no doubt that out of these
illogical and even uncouth symbols, Egyptian people were able to
fashion for themselves ways of genuine devotion and consolation.  The
desire for immortality was very strong in the Egyptian mind, and the
religious life of Egypt turned on that desire. The Egyptian religion
was an immortality religion as no other religion had ever been. As
Egypt went down under foreign conquerors and the Egyptian gods ceased
to have any satisfactory political significance, this craving for a
life of compensations here-after, intensified.


ISIS AND HORUS
ISIS AND HORUS


After the Greek conquest, the new city of Alexandria became the centre
of Egyptian religious life, and indeed of the religious life of the
whole Hellenic world.  A great temple, the Serapeum, was set up by
Ptolemy I at which a sort of trinity of gods was worshipped. These were
Serapis (who was Osiris-Apis rechristened), Isis and Horus. These were
not regarded as separate gods but as three aspects of one god, and
Serapis was identified with the Greek Zeus, the Roman Jupiter and the
Persian sun-god.  This worship spread wherever the Hellenic influence
extended, even into North India and Western China.  The idea of
immortality, an immortality of compensations and consolation, was
eagerly received by a world in which the common life was hopelessly
wretched.  Serapis was called “the saviour of souls.”  “After death,”
said the hymns of that time, “we are still in the care of his
providence.”  Isis attracted many devotees.  Her images stood in her
temples, as Queen of Heaven, bearing the infant Horus in her arms. 
Candles were burnt before her, votive offerings were made to her,
shaven priests consecrated to celibacy waited on her altar.

The rise of the Roman empire opened the western European world to this
growing cult.  The temples of Serapis-Isis, the chanting of the priests
and the hope of immortal life, followed the Roman standards to Scotland
and Holland.  But there were many rivals to the Serapis-Isis religion.
Prominent among these was Mithraism.  This was a religion of Persian
origin, and it centred upon some now forgotten mysteries about Mithras
sacrificing a sacred and benevolent bull.  Here we seem to have
something more primordial than the complicated and sophisticated
Serapis-Isis beliefs.  We are carried back directly to the blood
sacrifices of the heliolithic stage in human culture.  The bull upon
the Mithraic monuments always bleeds copiously from a wound in its
side, and from this blood springs new life.  The votary to Mithraism
actually bathed in the blood of the sacrificial bull.  At his
initiation he went beneath a scaffolding upon which a bull was killed
so that the blood could actually run down on him.

Both these religions, and the same is true of many other of the
numerous parallel cults that sought the allegiance of the slaves and
citizens under the earlier Roman emperors, are personal religions. 
They aim at personal salvation and personal immortality.  The older
religions were not personal like that; they were social.  The older
fashion of divinity was god or goddess of the city first or of the
state, and only secondarily of the individual.  The sacrifices were a
public and not a private function.  They concerned collective practical
needs in this world in which we live.  But the Greeks first and now the
Romans had pushed religion out of politics.  Guided by the Egyptian
tradition religion had retreated to the other world.

These new private immortality religions took all the heart and emotion
out of the old state religions, but they did not actually replace them.
 A typical city under the earlier Roman emperors would have a number of
temples to all sorts of gods.  There might be a temple to Jupiter of
the Capitol, the great god of Rome, and there would probably be one to
the reigning Cæsar.  For the Cæsars had learnt from the Pharaohs the
possibility of being gods.  In such temples a cold and stately
political worship went on; one would go and make an offering and burn a
pinch of incense to show one’s loyalty.  But it would be to the temple
of Isis, the dear Queen of Heaven, one would go with the burthen of
one’s private troubles for advice and relief.  There might be local and
eccentric gods.  Seville, for example, long affected the worship of the
old Carthaginian Venus.  In a cave or an underground temple there would
certainly be an altar to Mithras, attended by legionaries and slaves. 
And probably also there would be a synagogue where the Jews gathered to
read their Bible and uphold their faith in the unseen God of all the
Earth.

Sometimes there would be trouble with the Jews about the political side
of the state religion.  They held that their God was a jealous God
intolerant of idolatry, and they would refuse to take part in the
public sacrifices to Cæsar. They would not even salute the Roman
standards for fear of idolatry.

In the East long before the time of Buddha there had been ascetics, men
and women who gave up most of the delights of life, who repudiated
marriage and property and sought spiritual powers and an escape from
the stresses and mortifications of the world in abstinence, pain and
solitude. Buddha himself set his face against ascetic extravagances,
but many of his disciples followed a monkish life of great severity. 
Obscure Greek cults practised similar disciplines even to the extent of
self-mutilation.  Asceticism appeared in the Jewish communities of
Judea and Alexandria also in the first century B.C.  Communities of men
abandoned the world and gave themselves to austerities and mystical
contemplation.  Such was the sect of the Essenes.  Throughout the first
and second centuries A.D. there was an almost world-wide resort to such
repudiations of life, a universal search for “salvation” from the
distresses of the time.  The old sense of an established order, the old
confidence in priest and temple and law and custom, had gone.  Amidst
the prevailing slavery, cruelty, fear, anxiety, waste, display and
hectic self-indulgence, went this epidemic of self- disgust and mental
insecurity, this agonized search for peace even at the price of
renunciation and voluntary suffering. This it was that filled the
Serapeum with weeping penitents and brought the converts into the gloom
and gore of the Mithraic cave.




XXXVII
THE TEACHING OF JESUS


It was while Augustus Cæsar, the first of the Emperors, was reigning in
Rome that Jesus who is the Christ of Christianity was born in Judea. In
his name a religion was to arise which was destined to become the
official religion of the entire Roman Empire.

Now it is on the whole more convenient to keep history and theology
apart.  A large proportion of the Christian world believes that Jesus
was an incarnation of that God of all the Earth whom the Jews first
recognized.  The historian, if he is to remain historian, can neither
accept nor deny that interpretation.  Materially Jesus appeared in the
likeness of a man, and it is as a man that the historian must deal with
him.

He appeared in Judea in the reign of Tiberius Cæsar.  He was a prophet.
 He preached after the fashion of the preceding Jewish prophets.  He
was a man of about thirty, and we are in the profoundest ignorance of
his manner of life before his preaching began.

Our only direct sources of information about the life and teaching of
Jesus are the four Gospels.  All four agree in giving us a picture of a
very definite personality.  One is obliged to say, “Here was a man. 
This could not have been invented.”

But just as the personality of Gautama Buddha has been distorted and
obscured by the stiff squatting figure, the gilded idol of later
Buddhism, so one feels that the lean and strenuous personality of Jesus
is much wronged by the unreality and conventionality that a mistaken
reverence has imposed upon his figure in modern Christian art.  Jesus
was a penniless teacher, who wandered about the dusty sun-bit country
of Judea, living upon casual gifts of food; yet he is always
represented clean, combed and sleek, in spotless raiment, erect and
with something motionless about him as though he was gliding through
the air. This alone has made him unreal and incredible to many people
who cannot distinguish the core of the story from the ornamental and
unwise additions of the unintelligently devout.

We are left, if we do strip this record of these difficult accessories,
with the figure of a being, very human, very earnest and passionate,
capable of swift anger, and teaching a new and simple and profound
doctrine—namely, the universal loving Fatherhood of God and the coming
of the Kingdom of Heaven.  He was clearly a person—to use a common
phrase—of intense personal magnetism.  He attracted followers and
filled them with love and courage. Weak and ailing people were
heartened and healed by his presence.  Yet he was probably of a
delicate physique, because of the swiftness with which he died under
the pains of crucifixion.  There is a tradition that he fainted when,
according to the custom, he was made to bear his cross to the place of
execution.  He went about the country for three years spreading his
doctrine and then he came to Jerusalem and was accused of trying to set
up a strange kingdom in Judea; he was tried upon this charge, and
crucified together with two thieves.  Long before these two were dead
his sufferings were over.

The doctrine of the Kingdom of Heaven, which was the main teaching of
Jesus, is certainly one of the most revolutionary doctrines that ever
stirred and changed human thought.  It is small wonder if the world of
that time failed to grasp its full significance, and recoiled in dismay
from even a half apprehension of its tremendous challenges to the
established habits and institutions of mankind.  For the doctrine of
the Kingdom of Heaven, as Jesus seems to have preached it, was no less
than a bold and uncompromising demand for a complete change and
cleansing of the life of our struggling race, an utter cleansing,
without and within.  To the gospels the reader must go for all that is
preserved of this tremendous teaching; here we are only concerned with
the jar of its impact upon established ideas.

The Jews were persuaded that God, the one God of the whole world, was a
righteous god, but they also thought of him as a trading god who had
made a bargain with their Father Abraham about them, a very good
bargain indeed for them, to bring them at last to predominance in the
earth. With dismay and anger they heard Jesus sweeping away their dear
securities.  God, he taught, was no bargainer; there were no chosen
people and no favourites in the Kingdom of Heaven.  God was the loving
father of all life, as incapable of showing favour as the universal
sun.  And all men were brothers—sinners alike and beloved sons alike—of
this divine father.  In the parable of the Good Samaritan Jesus cast
scorn upon that natural tendency we all obey, to glorify our own people
and to minimize the righteousness of other creeds and other races.  In
the parable of the labourers he thrust aside the obstinate claim of the
Jews to have a special claim upon God. All whom God takes into the
kingdom, he taught, God serves alike; there is no distinction in his
treatment, because there is no measure to his bounty.  From all
moreover, as the parable of the buried talent witnesses, and as the
incident of the widow’s mite enforces, he demands the utmost. There are
no privileges, no rebates and no excuses in the Kingdom of Heaven.

But it is not only the intense tribal patriotism of the Jews that Jesus
outraged.  They were a people of intense family loyalty, and he would
have swept away all the narrow and restrictive family affections in the
great flood of the love of God.  The whole kingdom of Heaven was to be
the family of his followers.  We are told that, “While he yet talked to
the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring
to speak with him.  Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy
brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.  But he answered
and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my
brethren? And he stretched forth his hands towards his disciples, and
said, Behold my mother and my brethren!  For whosoever shall do the
will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and
sister, and mother.?  [1]

And not only did Jesus strike at patriotism and the bonds of family
loyalty in the name of God’s universal fatherhood and brotherhood of
all mankind, but it is clear that his teaching condemned all the
gradations of the economic system, all private wealth, and personal
advantages.  All men belonged to the kingdom; all their possessions
belonged to the kingdom; the righteous life for all men, the only
righteous life, was the service of God’s will with all that we had,
with all that we were. Again and again he denounced private riches and
the reservation of any private life.

“And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and
kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may
inherit eternal life?  And Jesus said to him, Why callest thou me good?
there is none good but one, that is God.  Thou knowest the
commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not
bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother.  And he
answered and said unto him, Master, all these things have I observed
from my youth.  Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him,
One thing thou lackest; go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give
to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, take up
the cross, and follow me.  And he was sad at that saying, and went away
grieved; for he had great possessions.

“And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly
shall they that have riches enter into the Kingdom of God!  And the
disciples were astonished at his words.  But Jesus answered again, and
saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches
to enter into the Kingdom of God!  It is easier for a camel to go
through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the
Kingdom of God.”  [2]

Moreover, in his tremendous prophecy of this kingdom which was to make
all men one together in God, Jesus had small patience for the
bargaining righteousness of formal religion. Another large part of his
recorded utterances is aimed against the meticulous observance of the
rules of the pious career.  “Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him,
Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders,
but eat bread with unwashen hands?  He answered and said unto them,
Well hath Isaiah prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written,

“This people honoureth me with their lips,

“But their heart is far from me.

“Howbeit in vain do they worship me,

“Teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.

“For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men,
as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such things ye do.  And
he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye
may keep your own tradition.”  [3]

It was not merely a moral and a social revolution that Jesus
proclaimed; it is clear from a score of indications that his teaching
had a political bent of the plainest sort.  It is true that he said his
kingdom was not of this world, that it was in the hearts of men and not
upon a throne; but it is equally clear that wherever and in what
measure his kingdom was set up in the hearts of men, the outer world
would be in that measure revolutionized and made new.

Whatever else the deafness and blindness of his hearers may have missed
in his utterances, it is plain they did not miss his resolve to
revolutionize the world.  The whole tenor of the opposition to him and
the circumstances of his trial and execution show clearly that to his
contemporaries he seemed to propose plainly, and did propose plainly,
to change and fuse and enlarge all human life.

In view of what he plainly said, is it any wonder that all who were
rich and prosperous felt a horror of strange things, a swimming of
their world at his teaching?  He was dragging out all the little
private reservations they had made from social service into the light
of a universal religious life.  He was like some terrible moral
huntsman digging mankind out of the snug burrows in which they had
lived hitherto.  In the white blaze of this kingdom of his there was to
be no property, no privilege, no pride and precedence; no motive indeed
and no reward but love.  Is it any wonder that men were dazzled and
blinded and cried out against him?  Even his disciples cried out when
he would not spare them the light. Is it any wonder that the priests
realized that between this man and themselves there was no choice but
that he or priestcraft should perish?  Is it any wonder that the Roman
soldiers, confronted and amazed by something soaring over their
comprehension and threatening all their disciplines, should take refuge
in wild laughter, and crown him with thorns and robe him in purple and
make a mock Cæsar of him?  For to take him seriously was to enter upon
a strange and alarming life, to abandon habits, to control instincts
and impulses, to essay an incredible happiness. . . .

XXXVIII
THE DEVELOPMENT OF DOCTRINAL CHRISTIANITY


In the four gospels we find the personality and teachings of Jesus but
very little of the dogmas of the Christian church. It is in the
epistles, a series of writings by the immediate followers of Jesus,
that the broad lines of Christian belief are laid down.

Chief among the makers of Christian doctrine was St. Paul. He had never
seen Jesus nor heard him preach.  Paul’s name was originally Saul, and
he was conspicuous at first as an active persecutor of the little band
of disciples after the crucifixion.  Then he was suddenly converted to
Christianity, and he changed his name to Paul.  He was a man of great
intellectual vigour and deeply and passionately interested in the
religious movements of the time.  He was well versed in Judaism and in
the Mithraism and Alexandrian religion of the day.  He carried over
many of their ideas and terms of expression into Christianity.  He did
very little to enlarge or develop the original teaching of Jesus, the
teaching of the Kingdom of Heaven.  But he taught that Jesus was not
only the promised Christ, the promised leader of the Jews, but also
that his death was a sacrifice, like the deaths of the ancient
sacrificial victims of the primordial civilizations, for the redemption
of mankind.

When religions flourish side by side they tend to pick up each other’s
ceremonial and other outward peculiarities.  Buddhism, for example, in
China has now almost the same sort of temples and priests and uses as
Taoism, which follows in the teachings of Lao Tse.  Yet the original
teachings of Buddhism and Taoism were almost flatly opposed.  And it
reflects no doubt or discredit upon the essentials of Christian
teaching that it took over not merely such formal things as the shaven
priest, the votive offering, the altars, candles, chanting and images
of the Alexandrian and Mithraic faiths, but adopted even their
devotional phrases and their theological ideas.  All these religions
were flourishing side by side with many less prominent cults. Each was
seeking adherents, and there must have been a constant going and coming
of converts between them. Sometimes one or other would be in favour
with the government.  But Christianity was regarded with more suspicion
than its rivals because, like the Jews, its adherents would not perform
acts of worship to the God Cæsar.  This made it a seditious religion,
quite apart from the revolutionary spirit of the teachings of Jesus
himself.

St. Paul familiarized his disciples with the idea that Jesus, like
Osiris, was a god who died to rise again and give men immortality.  And
presently the spreading Christian community was greatly torn by
complicated theological disputes about the relationship of this God
Jesus to God the Father of Mankind.  The Arians taught that Jesus was
divine, but distant from and inferior to the Father.  The Sabellians
taught that Jesus was merely an aspect of the Father, and that God was
Jesus and Father at the same time just as a man may be a father and an
artificer at the same time; and the Trinitarians taught a more subtle
doctrine that God was both one and three, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. 
For a time it seemed that Arianism would prevail over its rivals, and
then after disputes, violence and wars, the Trinitarian formula became
the accepted formula of all Christendom.  It may be found in its
completest expression in the Athanasian Creed.

We offer no comment on these controversies here.  They do not sway
history as the personal teaching of Jesus sways history. The personal
teaching of Jesus does seem to mark a new phase in the moral and
spiritual life of our race.  Its insistence upon the universal
Fatherhood of God and the implicit brotherhood of all men, its
insistence upon the sacredness of every human personality as a living
temple of God, was to have the profoundest effect upon all the
subsequent social and political life of mankind.  With Christianity,
with the spreading teachings of Jesus, a new respect appears in the
world for man as man.  It may be true, as hostile critics of
Christianity have urged, that St.. Paul preached obedience to slaves,
but it is equally true that the whole spirit of the teachings of Jesus
preserved in the gospels was against the subjugation of man by man. 
And still more distinctly was Christianity opposed to such outrages
upon human dignity as the gladiatorial combats in the arena.


THE BAPTISM OF CHRIST
THE BAPTISM OF CHRIST

_(Sixth Century Ivory Panel in the British Museum)_


Throughout the first two centuries after Christ, the Christian religion
spread throughout the Roman Empire, weaving together an ever-growing
multitude of converts into a new community of ideas and will.  The
attitude of the emperors varied between hostility and toleration. 
There were attempts to suppress this new faith in both the second and
third centuries; and finally in 303 and the following years a great
persecution under the Emperor Diocletian.  The considerable
accumulations of Church property were seized, all bibles and religious
writings were confiscated and destroyed, Christians were put out of the
protection of the law and many executed.  The destruction of the books
is particularly notable.  It shows how the power of the written word in
holding together the new faith was appreciated by the authorities. 
These “book religions,” Christianity and Judaism, were religions that
educated. Their continued existence depended very largely on people
being able to read and understand their doctrinal ideas.  The older
religions had made no such appeal to the personal intelligence.  In the
ages of barbaric confusion that were now at hand in western Europe it
was the Christian church that was mainly instrumental in preserving the
tradition of learning.

The persecution of Diocletian failed completely to suppress the growing
Christian community.  In many provinces it was ineffective because the
bulk of the population and many of the officials were Christian.  In
317 an edict of toleration was issued by the associated Emperor
Galerius, and in 324 Constantine the Great, a friend and on his
deathbed a baptized convert to Christianity, became sole ruler of the
Roman world.  He abandoned all divine pretensions and put Christian
symbols on the shields and banners of his troops.

In a few years Christianity was securely established as the official
religion of the empire.  The competing religions disappeared or were
absorbed with extraordinary celerity, and in 300 Theodosius the Great
caused the great statue of Jupiter Serapis at Alexandria to be
destroyed.  From the outset of the fifth century onward the only
priests or temples in the Roman Empire were Christian priests and
temples.




XXXIX
THE BARBARIANS BREAK THE EMPIRE INTO EAST AND WEST


Throughout the third century the Roman Empire, decaying socially and
disintegrating morally, faced the barbarians. The emperors of this
period were fighting military autocrats, and the capital of the empire
shifted with the necessities of their military policy. Now the imperial
headquarters would be at Milan in north Italy, now in what is now
Serbia at Sirmium or Nish, now in Nicomedia in Asia Minor. Rome halfway
down Italy was too far from the centre of interest to be a convenient
imperial seat. It was a declining city. Over most of the empire peace
still prevailed and men went about without arms. The armies continued
to be the sole repositories of power; the emperors, dependent on their
legions, became more and more autocratic to the rest of the empire and
their state more and more like that of the Persian and other oriental
monarchs. Diocletian assumed a royal diadem and oriental robes.

All along the imperial frontier, which ran roughly along the Rhine and
Danube, enemies were now pressing.  The Franks and other German tribes
had come up to the Rhine.  In north Hungary were the Vandals; in what
was once Dacia and is now Roumania, the Visigoths or West Goths. 
Behind these in south Russia were the East Goths or Ostrogoths, and
beyond these again in the Volga region the Alans.  But now Mongolian
peoples were forcing their way towards Europe.  The Huns were already
exacting tribute from the Alans and Ostrogoths and pushing them to the
west.

In Asia the Roman frontiers were crumpling back under the push of a
renascent Persia.  This new Persia, the Persia of the Sassenid kings,
was to be a vigorous and on the whole a successful rival of the Roman
Empire in Asia for the next three centuries.

A glance at the map of Europe will show the reader the peculiar
weakness of the empire.  The river Danube comes down to within a couple
of hundred miles of the Adriatic Sea in the region of what is now
Bosnia and Serbia. It makes a square re-entrant angle there.  The
Romans never kept their sea communications in good order, and this two
hundred mile strip of land was their line of communication between the
western Latin-speaking part of the empire and the eastern
Greek-speaking portion.  Against this square angle of the Danube the
barbarian pressure was greatest.  When they broke through there it was
inevitable that the empire should fall into two parts.


Map: The Empire and the Barbarians

A more vigorous empire might have thrust forward and reconquered Dacia,
but the Roman Empire lacked any such vigour.  Constantine the Great was
certainly a monarch of great devotion and intelligence.  He beat back a
raid of the Goths from just these vital Balkan regions, but he had no
force to carry the frontier across the Danube.  He was too pre-occupied
with the internal weaknesses of the empire.  He brought the solidarity
and moral force of Christianity to revive the spirit of the declining
empire, and he decided to create a new permanent capital at Byzantium
upon the Hellespont.  This new-made Byzantium, which was re-christened
Constantinople in his honour, was still building when he died.  Towards
the end of his reign occurred a remarkable transaction.  The Vandals,
being pressed by the Goths, asked to be received into the Roman Empire.
 They were assigned lands in Pannonia, which is now that part of
Hungary west of the Danube, and their fighting men became nominally
legionaries.  But these new legionaries remained under their own
chiefs.  Rome failed to digest them.

Constantine died working to reorganize his great realm, and soon the
frontiers were ruptured again and the Visigoths came almost to
Constantinople. They defeated the Emperor Valens at Adrianople and made
a settlement in what is now Bulgaria, similar to the settlement of the
Vandals in Pannonia. Nominally they were subjects of the emperor,
practically they were conquerors.

From 379 to 395 A.D. reigned the Emperor Theodosius the Great, and
while he reigned the empire was still formally intact.  Over the armies
of Italy and Pannonia presided Stilicho, a Vandal, over the armies in
the Balkan peninsula, Alaric, a Goth.  When Theodosius died at the
close of the fourth century he left two sons. Alaric supported one of
these, Arcadius, in Constantinople, and Stilicho the other, Honorius,
in Italy.  In other words Alaric and Stilicho fought for the empire
with the princes as puppets.  In the course of their struggle Alaric
marched into Italy and after a short siege took Rome (410 A.D.).

The opening half of the fifth century saw the whole of the Roman Empire
in Europe the prey of robber armies of barbarians.  It is difficult to
visualize the state of affairs in the world at that time.  Over France,
Spain, Italy and the Balkan peninsula, the great cities that had
flourished under the early empire still stood, impoverished, partly
depopulated and falling into decay.  Life in them must have been
shallow, mean and full of uncertainty.  Local officials asserted their
authority and went on with their work with such conscience as they had,
no doubt in the name of a now remote and inaccessible emperor.  The
churches went on, but usually with illiterate priests.  There was
little reading and much superstition and fear.  But everywhere except
where looters had destroyed them, books and pictures and statuary and
such-like works of art were still to be found.

The life of the countryside had also degenerated.  Everywhere this
Roman world was much more weedy and untidy than it had been.  In some
regions war and pestilence had brought the land down to the level of a
waste.  Roads and forests were infested with robbers.  Into such
regions the barbarians marched, with little or no opposition, and set
up their chiefs as rulers, often with Roman official titles.  If they
were half civilized barbarians they would give the conquered districts
tolerable terms, they would take possession of the towns, associate and
intermarry, and acquire (with an accent) the Latin speech; but the
Jutes, the Angles and Saxons who submerged the Roman province of
Britain were agriculturalists and had no use for towns, they seem to
have swept south Britain clear of the Romanized population and they
replaced the language by their own Teutonic dialects, which became at
last English.

It is impossible in the space at our disposal to trace the movements of
all the various German and Slavonic tribes as they went to and fro in
the disorganized empire in search of plunder and a pleasant home.  But
let the Vandals serve as an example.  They came into history in east
Germany.  They settled as we have told in Pannonia.  Thence they moved
somewhen about 425 A.D. through the intervening provinces to Spain. 
There they found Visigoths from South Russia and other German tribes
setting up dukes and kings.  From Spain the Vandals under Genseric
sailed for North Africa (429), captured Carthage (439), and built a
fleet.  They secured the mastery of the sea and captured and pillaged
Rome (455), which had recovered very imperfectly from her capture and
looting by Alaric half a century earlier.  Then the Vandals made
themselves masters of Sicily, Corsica, Sardinia and most of the other
islands of the western Mediterranean.  They made, in fact, a sea empire
very similar in its extent to the sea empire of Carthage seven hundred
odd years before.  They were at the climax of their power about 477. 
They were a mere handful of conquerors holding all this country.  In
the next century almost all their territory had been reconquered for
the empire of Constantinople during a transitory blaze of energy under
Justinian I.

The story of the Vandals is but one sample of a host of similar
adventures.  But now there was coming into the European world the least
kindred and most redoubtable of all these devastators, the Mongolian
Huns or Tartars, a yellow people active and able, such as the western
world had never before encountered.




XL
THE HUNS AND THE END OF THE WESTERN EMPIRE


This appearance of a conquering Mongolian people in Europe may be taken
to mark a new stage in human history. Until the last century or so
before the Christian era, the Mongol and the Nordic peoples had not
been in close touch. Far away in the frozen lands beyond the northern
forests the Lapps, a Mongolian people, had drifted westward as far as
Lapland, but they played no part in the main current of history. For
thousands of years the western world carried on the dramatic interplay
of the Aryan, Semitic and fundamental brunette peoples with very little
interference (except for an Ethiopian invasion of Egypt or so) either
from the black peoples to the south or from the Mongolian world in the
far East.

It is probable that there were two chief causes for the new westward
drift of the nomadic Mongolians.  One was the consolidation of the
great empire of China, its extension northward and the increase of its
population during the prosperous period of the Han dynasty.  The other
was some process of climatic change; a lesser rainfall that abolished
swamps and forests perhaps, or a greater rainfall that extended grazing
over desert steppes, or even perhaps both these processes going on in
different regions but which anyhow facilitated a westward migration.  A
third contributary cause was the economic wretchedness, internal decay
and falling population of the Roman Empire.  The rich men of the later
Roman Republic, and then the tax-gatherers of the military emperors had
utterly consumed its vitality. So we have the factors of thrust, means
and opportunity. There was pressure from the east, rot in the west and
an open road.

The Hun had reached the eastern boundaries of European Russia by the
first century A.D., but it was not until the fourth and fifth centuries
A.D. that these horsemen rose to predominance upon the steppes.  The
fifth century was the Hun’s century. The first Huns to come into Italy
were mercenary bands in the pay of Stilicho the Vandal, the master of
Honorius. Presently they were in possession of Pannonia, the empty nest
of the Vandals.

By the second quarter of the fifth century a great war chief had arisen
among the Huns, Attila.  We have only vague and tantalizing glimpses of
his power.  He ruled not only over the Huns but over a conglomerate of
tributary Germanic tribes; his empire extended from the Rhine cross the
plains into Central Asia.  He exchanged ambassadors with China.  His
head camp was in the plain of Hungary east of the Danube. There he was
visited by an envoy from Constantinople, Priscus, who has left us an
account of his state.  The way of living of these Mongols was very like
the way of living of the primitive Aryans they had replaced.  The
common folk were in huts and tents; the chiefs lived in great stockaded
timber halls.  There were feasts and drinking and singing by the bards.
 The Homeric heroes and even the Macedonian companions of Alexander
would probably have felt more at home in the camp-capital of Attila
than they would have done in the cultivated and decadent court of
Theodosius II, the son of Arcadius, who was then reigning in
Constantinople.

For a time it seemed as though the nomads under the leadership of the
Huns and Attila would play the same part towards the Græco-Roman
civilization of the Mediterranean countries that the barbaric Greeks
had played long ago to the Ægean civilization.  It looked like history
repeating itself upon a larger stage.  But the Huns were much more
wedded to the nomadic life than the early Greeks, who were rather
migratory cattle farmers than true nomads.  The Huns raided and
plundered but did not settle.

For some years Attila bullied Theodosius as he chose.  His armies
devastated and looted right down to the walls of Constantinople, Gibbon
says that he totally destroyed no less than seventy cities in the
Balkan peninsula, and Theodosius bought him off by payments of tribute
and tried to get rid of him for good by sending secret agents to
assassinate him.  In 451 Attila turned his attention to the remains of
the Latin- speaking half of the empire and invaded Gaul.  Nearly every
town in northern Gaul was sacked.  Franks, Visigoths and the imperial
forces united against him and he was defeated at Troyes in a vast
dispersed battle in which a multitude of men, variously estimated as
between 150,000 and 300,000, were killed. This checked him in Gaul, but
it did not exhaust his enormous military resources.  Next year he came
into Italy by way of Venetia, burnt Aquileia and Padua and looted
Milan.

Numbers of fugitives from these north Italian towns and particularly
from Padua fled to islands in the lagoons at the head of the Adriatic
and laid there the foundations of the city state of Venice, which was
to become one of the greatest or the trading centres in the middle
ages.

In 453 Attila died suddenly after a great feast to celebrate his
marriage to a young woman, and at his death this plunder confederation
of his fell to pieces.  The actual Huns disappear from history, mixed
into the surrounding more numerous Aryan-speaking populations.  But
these great Hun raids practically consummated the end of the Latin
Roman Empire.  After his death ten different emperors ruled in Rome in
twenty years, set up by Vandal and other mercenary troops.  The Vandals
from Carthage took and sacked Rome in 455.  Finally in 476 Odoacer, the
chief of the barbarian troops, suppressed a Pannonian who was figuring
as emperor under the impressive name of Romulus Augustulus, and
informed the Court of Constantinople that there was no longer an
emperor in the west.  So ingloriously the Latin Roman Empire came to an
end.  In 493 Theodoric the Goth became King of Rome.

All over western and central Europe now barbarian chiefs were reigning
as kings, dukes and the like, practically independent but for the most
part professing some sort of shadowy allegiance to the emperor.  There
were hundreds and perhaps thousands of such practically independent
brigand rulers.  In Gaul, Spain and Italy and in Dacia the Latin speech
still prevailed in locally distorted forms, but in Britain and east of
the Rhine languages of the German group (or in Bohemia a Slavonic
language, Czech) were the common speech.  The superior clergy and a
small remnant of other educated men read and wrote Latin.  Everywhere
life was insecure and property was held by the strong arm.  Castles
multiplied and roads fell into decay.  The dawn of the sixth century
was an age of division and of intellectual darkness throughout the
western world.  Had it not been for the monks and Christian
missionaries Latin learning might have perished altogether.

Why had the Roman Empire grown and why had it so completely decayed? 
It grew because at first the idea of citizenship held it together. 
Throughout the days of the expanding republic, and even into the days
of the early empire there remained a great number of men conscious of
Roman citizenship, feeling it a privilege and an obligation to be a
Roman citizen, confident of their rights under the Roman law and
willing to make sacrifices in the name of Rome.  The prestige of Rome
as of something just and great and law- upholding spread far beyond the
Roman boundaries.  But even as early as the Punic wars the sense of
citizenship was being undermined by the growth of wealth and slavery. 
Citizenship spread indeed but not the idea of citizenship.

The Roman Empire was after all a very primitive organization; it did
not educate, did not explain itself to its increasing multitudes of
citizens, did not invite their co-operation in its decisions.  There
was no network of schools to ensure a common understanding, no
distribution of news to sustain collective activity.  The adventurers
who struggled for power from the days of Marius and Sulla onward had no
idea of creating and calling in public opinion upon the imperial
affairs.  The spirit of citizenship died of starvation and no one
observed it die.  All empires, all states, all organizations of human
society are, in the ultimate, things of understanding and will.  There
remained no will for the Roman Empire in the World and so it came to an
end.

But though the Latin-speaking Roman Empire died in the fifth century,
something else had been born within it that was to avail itself
enormously of its prestige and tradition, and that was the
Latin-speaking half of the Catholic Church. This lived while the empire
died because it appealed to the minds and wills of men, because it had
books and a great system of teachers and missionaries to hold it
together, things stronger than any law or legions.  Throughout the
fourth and fifth centuries A.D. while the empire was decaying,
Christianity was spreading to a universal dominion in Europe.  It
conquered its conquerors, the barbarians.  When Attila seemed disposed
to march on Rome, the patriarch of Rome intercepted him and did what no
armies could do, turning him back by sheer moral force.

The Patriarch or Pope of Rome claimed to be the head of the entire
Christian church.  Now that there were no more emperors, he began to
annex imperial titles and claims.  He took the title of _pontifex
maximus_, head sacrificial priest of the Roman dominion, the most
ancient of all the titles that the emperors had enjoyed.




XLI
THE BYZANTINE AND SASSANID EMPIRES


The Greek-speaking eastern half of the Roman Empire showed much more
political tenacity than the western half. It weathered the disasters of
the fifth century A.D., which saw a complete and final breaking up of
the original Latin Roman power. Attila bullied the Emperor Theodosius
II and sacked and raided almost to the walls of Constantinople, but
that city remained intact. The Nubians came down the Nile and looted
Upper Egypt, but Lower Egypt and Alexandria were left still fairly
prosperous. Most of Asia Minor was held against the Sassanid Persians.

The sixth century, which was an age of complete darkness for the West,
saw indeed a considerable revival of the Greek power.  Justinian I
(527-565) was a ruler of very great ambition and energy, and he was
married to the Empress Theodora, a woman of quite equal capacity who
had begun life as an actress.  Justinian reconquered North Africa from
the Vandals and most of Italy from the Goths.  He even regained the
south of Spain.  He did not limit his energies to naval and military
enterprises.  He founded a university, built the great church of Sta.
Sophia in Constantinople and codified the Roman law.  But in order to
destroy a rival to his university foundation he closed the schools of
philosophy in Athens, which had been going on in unbroken continuity
from the days of Plato, that is to say for nearly a thousand years.

From the third century onwards the Persian Empire had been the
steadfast rival of the Byzantine.  The two empires kept Asia Minor,
Syria and Egypt in a state of perpetual unrest and waste.  In the first
century A.D., these lands were still at a high level of civilization,
wealthy and with an abundant population, but the continual coming and
going of armies, massacres, looting and war taxation wore them down
steadily until only shattered and ruinous cities remained upon a
countryside of scattered peasants.  In this melancholy process of
impoverishment and disorder lower Egypt fared perhaps less badly than
the rest of the world.  Alexandria, like Constantinople, continued a
dwindling trade between the east and the west.

Science and political philosophy seemed dead now in both these warring
and decaying empires.  The last philosophers of Athens, until their
suppression, preserved the texts of the great literature of the past
with an infinite reverence and want of understanding.  But there
remained no class of men in the world, no free gentlemen with bold and
independent habits of thought, to carry on the tradition of frank
statement and enquiry embodied in these writings.  The social and
political chaos accounts largely for the disappearance of this class,
but there was also another reason why the human intelligence was
sterile and feverish during this age.  In both Persia and Byzantium it
was all age of intolerance.  Both empires were religious empires in a
new way, in a way that greatly hampered the free activities of the
human mind.

Of course the oldest empires in the world were religious empires,
centring upon the worship of a god or of a god-king. Alexander was
treated as a divinity and the Cæsars were gods in so much as they had
altars and temples devoted to them and the offering of incense was made
a test of loyalty to the Roman state.  But these older religions were
essentially religions of act and fact.  They did not invade the mind. 
If a man offered his sacrifice and bowed to the god, he was left not
only to think but to say practically whatever he liked about the
affair.  But the new sort of religions that had come into the world,
and particularly Christianity, turned inward.  These new faiths
demanded not simply conformity but understanding belief.  Naturally
fierce controversy ensued upon the exact meaning of the things
believed.  These new religions were creed religions.  The world was
confronted with a new word, Orthodoxy, and with a stern resolve to keep
not only acts but speech and private thought within the limits of a set
teaching.  For to hold a wrong opinion, much more to convey it to other
people, was no longer regarded as an intellectual defect but a moral
fault that might condemn a soul to everlasting destruction.

Both Ardashir I who founded the Sassanid dynasty in the third century
A.D., and Constantine the Great who reconstructed the Roman Empire in
the fourth, turned to religious organizations for help, because in
these organizations they saw a new means of using and controlling the
wills of men.  And already before the end of the fourth century both
empires were persecuting free talk and religious innovation.  In Persia
Ardashir found the ancient Persian religion of Zoroaster (or
Zarathushtra) with its priests and temples and a sacred fire that burnt
upon its altars, ready for his purpose as a state religion.  Before the
end of the third century Zoroastrianism was persecuting Christianity,
and in 277 A.D. Mani, the founder of a new faith, the Manichæans, was
crucified and his body flayed. Constantinople, on its side, was busy
hunting out Christian heresies.  Manichæan ideas infected Christianity
and had to be fought with the fiercest methods; in return ideas from
Christianity affected the purity of the Zoroastrian doctrine. All ideas
became suspect.  Science, which demands before all things the free
action of an untroubled mind, suffered a complete eclipse throughout
this phase of intolerance.

War, the bitterest theology, and the usual vices of mankind constituted
Byzantine life of those days.  It was picturesque, it was romantic; it
had little sweetness or light.  When Byzantium and Persia were not
fighting the barbarians from the north, they wasted Asia Minor and
Syria in dreary and destructive hostilities.  Even in close alliance
these two empires would have found it a hard task to turn back the
barbarians and recover their prosperity.  The Turks or Tartars first
come into history as the allies first of one power and then of another.
 In the sixth century the two chief antagonists were Justinian and
Chosroes I; in the opening of the seventh the Emperor Heraclius was
pitted against Chosroes II (580).

At first and until after Heraclius had become Emperor (610) Chosroes II
carried all before him.  He took Antioch, Damascus and Jerusalem and
his armies reached Chalcedon, which is in Asia Minor over against
Constantinople.  In 619 he conquered Egypt.  Then Heraclius pressed a
counter attack home and routed a Persian army at Nineveh (627),
although at that time there were still Persian troops at Chalcedon.  In
628 Chosroes II was deposed and murdered by his son, Kavadh, and an
inconclusive peace was made between the two exhausted empires.

Byzantium and Persia had fought their last war.  But few people as yet
dreamt of the storm that was even then gathering in the deserts to put
an end for ever to this aimless, chronic struggle.

While Heraclius was restoring order in Syria a message reached him.  It
had been brought in to the imperial outpost at Bostra south of
Damascus; it was in Arabic, an obscure Semitic desert language, and it
was read to the Emperor, if it reached him at all, by an interpreter. 
It was from someone who called himself “Muhammad the Prophet of God.” 
It called upon the Emperor to acknowledge the One True God and to serve
him.  What the Emperor said is not recorded.

A similar message came to Kavadh at Ctesiphon.  He was annoyed, tore up
the letter, and bade the messenger begone.

This Muhammad, it appeared, was a Bedouin leader whose headquarters
were in the mean little desert town of Medina. He was preaching a new
religion of faith in the One True God.

“Even so, O Lord!” he said; “rend thou his Kingdom from Kavadh.”




XLII
THE DYNASTIES OF SUY AND TANG IN CHINA


Throughout the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth centuries, there was a
steady drift of Mongolian peoples westward. The Huns of Attila were
merely precursors of this advance, which led at last to the
establishment of Mongolian peoples in Finland, Esthonia, Hungary and
Bulgaria, where their descendants, speaking languages akin to Turkish,
survive to this day. The Mongolian nomads were, in fact, playing a role
towards the Aryanized civilizations of Europe and Persia and India that
the Aryans had played to the Ægean and Semitic civilizations ten or
fifteen centuries before.

In Central Asia the Turkish peoples had taken root in what is now
Western Turkestan, and Persia already employed many Turkish officials
and Turkish mercenaries.  The Parthians had gone out of history,
absorbed into the general population of Persia.  There were no more
Aryan nomads in the history of Central Asia; Mongolian people had
replaced them.  The Turks became masters of Asia from China to the
Caspian.

The same great pestilence at the end of the second century A.D. that
had shattered the Roman Empire had overthrown the Han dynasty in China.
 Then came a period of division and of Hunnish conquests from which
China arose refreshed, more rapidly and more completely than Europe was
destined to do.  Before the end of the sixth century China was reunited
under the Suy dynasty, and this by the time of Heraclius gave place to
the Tang dynasty, whose reign marks another great period of prosperity
for China.

Throughout the seventh, eighth and ninth centuries China was the most
secure and civilized country in the world.  The Han dynasty had
extended her boundaries in the north; the Suy and Tang dynasties now
spread her civilization to the south, and China began to assume the
proportions she has to-day.  In Central Asia indeed she reached much
further, extending at last, through tributary Turkish tribes, to Persia
and the Caspian Sea.

The new China that had arisen was a very different land from the old
China of the Hans.  A new and more vigorous literary school appeared,
there was a great poetic revival; Buddhism had revolutionized
philosophical and religious thought. There were great advances in
artistic work, in technical skill and in all the amenities of life. 
Tea was first used, paper manufactured and wood-block printing began. 
Millions of people indeed were leading orderly, graceful and kindly
lives in China during these centuries when the attenuated populations
of Europe and Western Asia were living either in hovels, small walled
cities or grim robber fortresses.  While the mind of the west was black
with theological obsessions, the mind of China was open and tolerant
and enquiring.

One of the earliest monarchs of the Tang dynasty was Tai- tsung, who
began to reign in 627, the year of the victory of Heraclius at Nineveh.
 He received an embassy from Heraclius, who was probably seeking an
ally in the rear of Persia.  From Persia itself came a party of
Christian missionaries (635). They were allowed to explain their creed
to Tai-tsung and he examined a Chinese translation of their Scriptures.
 He pronounced this strange religion acceptable, and gave permission
for the foundation of a church and monastery.

To this monarch also (in 628) came messengers from Muhammad. They came
to Canton on a trading ship.  They had sailed the whole way from Arabia
along the Indian coasts.  Unlike Heraclius and Kavadh, Tai-Tsung gave
these envoys a courteous hearing.  He expressed his interest in their
theological ideas and assisted them to build a mosque in Canton, a
mosque which survives, it is said, to this day, the oldest mosque in
the world.




XLIII
MUHAMMAD AND ISLAM


A prophetic amateur of history surveying the world in the opening of
the seventh century might have concluded very reasonably that it was
only a question of a few centuries before the whole of Europe and Asia
fell under Mongolian domination. There were no signs of order or union
in Western Europe, and the Byzantine and Persian Empires were
manifestly bent upon a mutual destruction. India also was divided and
wasted. On the other hand China was a steadily expanding empire which
probably at that time exceeded all Europe in population, and the
Turkish people who were growing to power in Central Asia were disposed
to work in accord with China. And such a prophecy would not have been
an altogether vain one. A time was to come in the thirteenth century
when a Mongolian overlord would rule from the Danube to the Pacific,
and Turkish dynasties were destined to reign over the entire Byzantine
and Persian Empires, over Egypt and most of India.

Where our prophet would have been most likely to have erred would have
been in under-estimating the recuperative power of the Latin end of
Europe and in ignoring the latent forces of the Arabian desert.  Arabia
would have seemed what it had been for times immemorial, the refuge of
small and bickering nomadic tribes.  No Semitic people had founded an
empire now for more than a thousand years.

Then suddenly the Bedouin flared out for a brief century of splendour. 
They spread their rule and language from Spain to the boundaries of
China.  They gave the world a new culture. They created a religion that
is still to this day one of the most vital forces in the world.

The man who fired this Arab flame appears first in history as the young
husband of the widow of a rich merchant of the town of Mecca, named
Muhammad.  Until he was forty he did very little to distinguish himself
in the world.  He seems to have taken considerable interest in
religious discussion.  Mecca was a pagan city at that time worshipping
in particular a black stone, the Kaaba, of great repute throughout all
Arabia and a centre of pilgrimages; but there were great numbers of
Jews in the country—indeed all the southern portion of Arabia professed
the Jewish faith—and there were Christian churches in Syria.

About forty Muhammad began to develop prophetic characteristics like
those of the Hebrew prophets twelve hundred years before him.  He
talked first to his wife of the One True God, and of the rewards and
punishments of virtue and wickedness.  There can be no doubt that his
thoughts were very strongly influenced by Jewish and Christian ideas. 
He gathered about him a small circle of believers and presently began
to preach in the town against the prevalent idolatry. This made him
extremely unpopular with his fellow townsmen because the pilgrimages to
the Kaaba were the chief source of such prosperity as Mecca enjoyed. 
He became bolder and more definite in his teaching, declaring himself
to be the last chosen prophet of God entrusted with a mission to
perfect religion.  Abraham, he declared, and Jesus Christ were his
forerunners.  He had been chosen to complete and perfect the revelation
of God’s will.

He produced verses which he said had been communicated to him by an
angel, and he had a strange vision in which he was taken up through the
Heavens to God and instructed in his mission.

As his teaching increased in force the hostility of his fellow townsmen
increased also.  At last a plot was made to kill him; but he escaped
with his faithful friend and disciple, Abu Bekr, to the friendly town
of Medina which adopted his doctrine.  Hostilities followed between
Mecca and Medina which ended at last in a treaty.  Mecca was to adopt
the worship of the One True God and accept Muhammad as his prophet,
_but the adherents of the new faith were still to make the pilgrimage
to Mecca_ just as they had done when they were pagans.  So Muhammad
established the One True God in Mecca without injuring its pilgrim
traffic.  In 629 Muhammad returned to Mecca as its master, a year after
he had sent out these envoys of his to Heraclius, Tai-tsung, Kavadh and
all the rulers of the earth.

Then for four years more until his death in 632, Muhammad spread his
power over the rest of Arabia.  He married a number of wives in his
declining years, and his life on the whole was by modern standards
unedifying.  He seems to have been a man compounded of very
considerable vanity, greed, cunning, self-deception and quite sincere
religious passion. He dictated a book of injunctions and expositions,
the Koran, which he declared was communicated to him from God. 
Regarded as literature or philosophy the Koran is certainly unworthy of
its alleged Divine authorship.

Yet when the manifest defects of Muhammad’s life and writings have been
allowed for, there remains in Islam, this faith he imposed upon the
Arabs, much power and inspiration. One is its uncompromising
monotheism; its simple enthusiastic faith in the rule and fatherhood of
God and its freedom from theological complications.  Another is its
complete detachment from the sacrificial priest and the temple.  It is
an entirely prophetic religion, proof against any possibility of
relapse towards blood sacrifices.  In the Koran the limited and
ceremonial nature of the pilgrimage to Mecca is stated beyond the
possibility of dispute, and every precaution was taken by Muhammad to
prevent the deification of himself after his death.  And a third
element of strength lay in the insistence of Islam upon the perfect
brotherhood and equality before God of all believers, whatever their
colour, origin or status.

These are the things that made Islam a power in human affairs.  It has
been said that the true founder of the Empire of Islam was not so much
Muhammad as his friend and helper, Abu Bekr.  If Muhammad, with his
shifty character, was the mind and imagination of primitive Islam, Abu
Bekr was its conscience and its will.  Whenever Muhammad wavered Abu
Bekr sustained him.  And when Muhammad died, Abu Bekr became Caliph (=
successor), and with that faith that moves mountains, he set himself
simply and sanely to organize the subjugation of the whole world to
Allah—with little armies of 3,000 or 4,000 Arabs—according to those
letters the prophet had written from Medina in 628 to all the monarchs
of the world.




XLIV
THE GREAT DAYS OF THE ARABS


There follows the most amazing story of conquest in the whole history
of our race. The Byzantine army was smashed at the battle of the Yarmuk
(a tributary of the Jordan) in 634; and the Emperor Heraclius, his
energy sapped by dropsy and his resources exhausted by the Persian war,
saw his new conquests in Syria, Damascus, Palmyra, Antioch, Jerusalem
and the rest fall almost without resistance to the Moslim. Large
elements in the population went over to Islam. Then the Moslim turned
east. The Persians had found an able general in Rustam; they had a
great host with a force of elephants; and for three days they fought
the Arabs at Kadessia (637) and broke at last in headlong rout.

The conquest of all Persia followed, and the Moslem Empire pushed far
into Western Turkestan and eastward until it met the Chinese.  Egypt
fell almost without resistance to the new conquerors, who full of a
fanatical belief in the sufficiency of the Koran, wiped out the
vestiges of the book-copying industry of the Alexandria Library.  The
tide of conquest poured along the north coast of Africa to the Straits
of Gibraltar and Spain.  Spain was invaded in 710 and the Pyrenees
Mountains were reached in 720.  In 732 the Arab advance had reached the
centre of France, but here it was stopped for good at the battle of
Poitiers and thrust back as far as the Pyrenees again.  The conquest of
Egypt had given the Moslim a fleet, and for a time it looked as though
they would take Constantinople.  They made repeated sea attacks between
672 and 718 but the great city held out against them.

The Arabs had little political aptitude and no political experience,
and this great empire with its capital now at Damascus, which stretched
from Spain to China, was destined to break up very speedily. From the
very beginning doctrinal differences undermined its unity.  But our
interest here lies not with the story of its political disintegration
but with its effect upon the human mind and upon the general destinies
of our race.  The Arab intelligence had been flung across the world
even more swiftly and dramatically than had the Greek a thousand years
before.  The intellectual stimulation of the whole world west of China,
the break-up of old ideas and development of new ones, was enormous.

In Persia this fresh excited Arabic mind came into contact not only
with Manichæan, Zoroastrian and Christian doctrine, but with the
scientific Greek literature, preserved not only in Greek but in Syrian
translations.  It found Greek learning in Egypt also. Every-where, and
particularly in Spain, it discovered an active Jewish tradition of
speculation and discussion.  In Central Asia it met Buddhism and the
material achievements of Chinese civilization.  It learnt the
manufacture of paper—which made printed books possible—from the
Chinese.  And finally it came into touch with Indian mathematics and
philosophy.

Very speedily the intolerant self-sufficiency of the early days of
faith, which made the Koran seem the only possible book, was dropped.
Learning sprang up everywhere in the footsteps of the Arab conquerors. 
By the eighth century there was an educational organization throughout
the whole “Arabized” world.  In the ninth learned men in the schools of
Cordoba in Spain were corresponding with learned men in Cairo, Bagdad,
Bokhara and Samarkand.  The Jewish mind assimilated very readily with
the Arab, and for a time the two Semitic races worked together through
the medium of Arabic.  Long after the political break-up and
enfeeblement of the Arabs, this intellectual community of the
Arab-speaking world endured.  It was still producing very considerable
results in the thirteenth century.

So it was that the systematic accumulation and criticism of facts which
was first begun by the Greeks was resumed in this astonishing
renascence of the Semitic world.  The seed of Aristotle and the museum
of Alexandria that had lain so long inactive and neglected now
germinated and began to grow towards fruition.  Very great advances
were made in mathematical, medical and physical science.  The clumsy
Roman numerals were ousted by the Arabic figures we use to this day and
the zero sign was first employed.  The very name algebra is Arabic.  So
is the word chemistry.  The names of such stars as Algol, Aldebaran and
Boötes preserve the traces of Arab conquests in the sky.  Their
philosophy was destined to reanimate the medieval philosophy of France
and Italy and the whole Christian world.

The Arab experimental chemists were called alchemists, and they were
still sufficiently barbaric in spirit to keep their methods and results
secret as far as possible.  They realized from the very beginning what
enormous advantages their possible discoveries might give them, and
what far-reaching consequences they might have on human life.  They
came upon many metallurgical and technical devices of the utmost value,
alloys and dyes, distilling, tinctures and essences, optical glass; but
the two chief ends they sought, they sought in vain.  One was “the
philosopher’s stone”—a means of changing the metallic elements one into
another and so getting a control of artificial gold, and the other was
the _elixir vitœ_, a stimulant that would revivify age and prolong life
indefinitely.  The crabbed patient experimenting of these Arab
alchemists spread into the Christian world.  The fascination of their
enquiries spread.  Very gradually the activities of these alchemists
became more social and co-operative.  They found it profitable to
exchange and compare ideas.  By insensible gradations the last of the
alchemists became the first of the experimental philosophers.

The old alchemists sought the philosopher’s stone which was to
transmute base metals to gold, and an elixir of immortality; they found
the methods of modern experimental science which promise in the end to
give man illimitable power over the world and over his own destiny.




XLV
THE DEVELOPMENT OF LATIN CHRISTENDOM


It is worth while to note the extremely shrunken dimensions of the
share of the world remaining under Aryan control in the seventh and
eighth centuries. A thousand years before, the Aryan-speaking races
were triumphant over all the civilized world west of China. Now the
Mongol had thrust as far as Hungary, nothing of Asia remained under
Aryan rule except the Byzantine dominions in Asia Minor, and all Africa
was lost and nearly all Spain. The great Hellenic world had shrunken to
a few possessions round the nucleus of the trading city of
Constantinople, and the memory of the Roman world was kept alive by the
Latin of the western Christian priests. In vivid contrast to this tale
of retrogression, the Semitic tradition had risen again from
subjugation and obscurity after a thousand years of darkness.

Yet the vitality of the Nordic peoples was not exhausted. Confined now
to Central and North-Western Europe and terribly muddled in their
social and political ideas, they were nevertheless building up
gradually and steadily a new social order and preparing unconsciously
for the recovery of a power even more extensive than that they had
previously enjoyed.

We have told how at the beginning of the sixth century there remained
no central government in Western Europe at all. That world was divided
up among numbers of local rulers holding their own as they could.  This
was too insecure a state of affairs to last; a system of co-operation
and association grew up in this disorder, the feudal system, which has
left its traces upon European life up to the present time.  This feudal
system was a sort of crystallization of society about power. 
Everywhere the lone man felt insecure and was prepared to barter a
certain amount of his liberty for help and protection.  He sought a
stronger man as his lord and protector; he gave him military services
and paid him dues, and in return he was confirmed in his possession of
what was his.  His lord again found safety in vassalage to a still
greater lord.  Cities also found it convenient to have feudal
protectors, and monasteries and church estates bound themselves by
similar ties.  No doubt in many cases allegiance was claimed before it
was offered; the system grew downward as well as upward.  So a sort of
pyramidal system grew up, varying widely in different localities,
permitting at first a considerable play of violence and private warfare
but making steadily for order and a new reign of law.  The pyramids
grew up until some became recognizable as kingdoms.  Already by the
early sixth century a Frankish kingdom existed under its founder Clovis
in what is now France and the Netherlands, and presently Visigothic and
Lombard and Gothic kingdoms were in existence.

The Moslim when they crossed the Pyrenees in 720 found this Frankish
kingdom under the practical rule of Charles Martel, the Mayor of the
Palace of a degenerate descendant of Clovis, and experienced the
decisive defeat of Poitiers (732) at his hands.  This Charles Martel
was practically overlord of Europe north of the Alps from the Pyrenees
to Hungary.  He ruled over a multitude of subordinate lords speaking
French- Latin, and High and Low German languages.  His son Pepin
extinguished the last descendants of Clovis and took the kingly state
and title.  His grandson Charlemagne, who began to reign in 768, found
himself lord of a realm so large that he could think of reviving the
title of Latin Emperor.  He conquered North Italy and made himself
master of Rome.

Martel

Approaching the story of Europe as we do from the wider horizons of a
world history we can see much more distinctly than the mere nationalist
historian how cramping and disastrous this tradition of the Latin Roman
Empire was.  A narrow intense struggle for this phantom predominance
was to consume European energy for more than a thousand years. Through
all that period it is possible to trace certain unquenchable
antagonisms; they run through the wits of Europe like the obsessions of
a demented mind.  One driving force was this ambition of successful
rulers, which Charlemagne (Charles the Great) embodied, to become
Cæsar.  The realm of Charlemagne consisted of a complex of feudal
German states at various stages of barbarism.  West of the Rhine, most
of these German peoples had learnt to speak various Latinized dialects
which fused at last to form French.  East of the Rhine, the racially
similar German peoples did not lose their German speech.  On account of
this, communication was difficult between these two groups of barbarian
conquerors and a split easily brought about.  The split was made the
more easy by the fact that the Frankish usage made it seem natural to
divide the empire of Charlemagne among his sons at his death.  So one
aspect of the history of Europe from the days of Charlemagne onwards is
a history of first this monarch and his family and then that,
struggling to a precarious headship of the kings, princes, dukes,
bishops and cities of Europe, while a steadily deepening antagonism
between the French and German speaking elements develops in the medley.
 There was a formality of election for each emperor; and the climax of
his ambition was to struggle to the possession of that worn-out,
misplaced capital Rome and to a coronation there.

The next factor in the European political disorder was the resolve of
the Church at Rome to make no temporal prince but the Pope of Rome
himself emperor in effect.  He was already pontifex maximus; for all
practical purposes he held the decaying city; if he had no armies he
had at least a vast propaganda organization in his priests throughout
the whole Latin world; if he had little power over men’s bodies he held
the keys of heaven and hell in their imaginations and could exercise
much influence upon their souls.  So throughout the middle ages while
one prince manœuvred against another first for equality, then for
ascendancy, and at last for the supreme prize, the Pope of Rome,
sometimes boldly, sometimes craftily, sometimes feebly—for the Popes
were a succession of oldish men and the average reign of a Pope was not
more than two years—manœuvred for the submission of all the princes to
himself as the ultimate overlord of Christendom.

But these antagonisms of prince against prince and of Emperor against
Pope do not by any means exhaust the factors of the European confusion.
 There was still an Emperor in Constantinople speaking Greek and
claiming the allegiance of all Europe.  When Charlemagne sought to
revive the empire, it was merely the Latin end of the empire he
revived.  It was natural that a sense of rivalry between Latin Empire
and Greek Empire should develop very readily.  And still more readily
did the rivalry of Greek-speaking Christianity and the newer
Latin-speaking version develop.  The Pope of Rome claimed to be the
successor of St. Peter, the chief of the apostles of Christ, and the
head of the Christian community everywhere.  Neither the emperor nor
the patriarch in Constantinople were disposed to acknowledge this
claim.  A dispute about a fine point in the doctrine of the Holy
Trinity consummated a long series of dissensions in a final rupture in
1054.  The Latin Church and the Greek Church became and remained
thereafter distinct and frankly antagonistic. This antagonism must be
added to the others in our estimate of the conflicts that wasted Latin
Christendom in the middle ages.

Upon this divided world of Christendom rained the blows of three sets
of antagonists.  About the Baltic and North Seas remained a series of
Nordic tribes who were only very slowly and reluctantly Christianized;
these were the Northmen.  They had taken to the sea and piracy, and
were raiding all the Christian coasts down to Spain.  They had pushed
up the Russian rivers to the desolate central lands and brought their
shipping over into the south-flowing rivers.  They had come out upon
the Caspian and Black Seas as pirates also.  They set up principalities
in Russia; they were the first people to be called Russians.  These
Northmen Russians came near to taking Constantinople.  England in the
early ninth century was a Christianized Low German country under a
king, Egbert, a protégé and pupil of Charlemagne.  The Northmen wrested
half the kingdom from his successor Alfred the Great (886), and finally
under Canute (1016) made themselves masters of the whole land.  Under
Rolph the Ganger (912) another band of Northmen conquered the north of
France, which became Normandy.

Canute ruled not only over England but over Norway and Denmark, but his
brief empire fell to pieces at his death through that political
weakness of the barbaric peoples—division among a ruler’s sons.  It is
interesting to speculate what might have happened if this temporary
union of the Northmen had endured.  They were a race of astonishing
boldness and energy.  They sailed in their galleys even to Iceland and
Greenland.  They were the first Europeans to land on American soil. 
Later on Norman adventurers were to recover Sicily from the Saracens
and sack Rome.  It is a fascinating thing to imagine what a great
northern sea-faring power might have grown out of Canute’s kingdom,
reaching from America to Russia.

To the east of the Germans and Latinized Europeans was a medley of Slav
tribes and Turkish peoples.  Prominent among these were the Magyars or
Hungarians who were coming westward throughout the eighth and ninth
centuries.  Charlemagne held them for a time, but after his death they
established themselves in what is now Hungary; and after the fashion of
their kindred predecessors, the Huns, raided every summer into the
settled parts of Europe.  In 938 they went through Germany into France,
crossed the Alps into North Italy, and so came home, burning, robbing
and destroying.

Finally pounding away from the south at the vestiges of the Roman
Empire were the Saracens.  They had made themselves largely masters of
the sea; their only formidable adversaries upon the water were the
Northmen, the Russian Northmen out of the Black Sea and the Northmen of
the west.


Map: Europe at the death of Charlemagne—814

Hemmed in by these more vigorous and aggressive peoples, amidst forces
they did not understand and dangers they could not estimate,
Charlemagne and after him a series of other ambitious spirits took up
the futile drama of restoring the Western Empire under the name of the
Holy Roman Empire.  From the time of Charlemagne onward this idea
obsessed the political life of Western Europe, while in the East the
Greek half of the Roman power decayed and dwindled until at last
nothing remained of it at all but the corrupt trading city of
Constantinople and a few miles of territory about it. Politically the
continent of Europe remained traditional and uncreative from the time
of Charlemagne onward for a thousand years.

The name of Charlemagne looms large in European history but his
personality is but indistinctly seen.  He could not read nor write, but
he had a considerable respect for learning; he liked to be read aloud
to at meals and he had a weakness for theological discussion.  At his
winter quarters at Aix-la- Chapelle or Mayence he gathered about him a
number of learned men and picked up much from their conversation.  In
the summer he made war, against the Spanish Saracens, against the Slavs
and Magyars, against the Saxons, and other still heathen German tribes.
 It is doubtful whether the idea of becoming Cæsar in succession to
Romulus Augustulus occurred to him before his acquisition of North
Italy, or whether it was suggested to him by Pope Leo III, who was
anxious to make the Latin Church independent of Constantinople.

There were the most extraordinary manœuvres at Rome between the Pope
and the prospective emperor in order to make it appear or not appear as
if the Pope gave him the imperial crown.  The Pope succeeded in
crowning his visitor and conqueror by surprise in St. Peter’s on
Christmas Day 800 A.D.  He produced a crown, put it on the head of
Charlemagne and hailed him Cæsar and Augustus.  There was great
applause among the people. Charlemagne was by no means pleased at the
way in which the thing was done, it rankled in his mind as a defeat;
and he left the most careful instructions to his son that he was not to
let the Pope crown him emperor; he was to seize the crown into his own
hands and put it on his own head himself.  So at the very outset of
this imperial revival we see beginning the age-long dispute of Pope and
Emperor for priority.  But Louis the Pious, the son of Charlemagne,
disregarded his father’s instructions and was entirely submissive to
the Pope.

The empire of Charlemagne fell apart at the death of Louis the Pious
and the split between the French-speaking Franks and the
German-speaking Franks widened.  The next emperor to arise was Otto,
the son of a certain Henry the Fowler, a Saxon, who had been elected
King of Germany by an assembly of German princes and prelates in 919. 
Otto descended upon Rome and was crowned emperor there in 962.  This
Saxon line came to an end early in the eleventh century and gave place
to other German rulers.  The feudal princes and nobles to the west who
spoke various French dialects did not fall under the sway of these
German emperors after the Carlovingian line, the line that is descended
from Charlemagne, had come to an end, and no part of Britain ever came
into the Holy Roman Empire.  The Duke of Normandy, the King of France
and a number of lesser feudal rulers remained outside.  In 987 the
Kingdom of France passed out of the possession of the Carlovingian line
into the hands of Hugh Capet, whose descendants were still reigning in
the eighteenth century.  At the time of Hugh Capet the King of France
ruled only a comparatively small territory round Paris.

In 1066 England was attacked almost simultaneously by an invasion of
the Norwegian Northmen under King Harold Hardrada and by the Latinized
Northmen under the Duke of Normandy. Harold King of England defeated
the former at the battle of Stamford Bridge, and was defeated by the
latter at Hastings. England was conquered by the Normans, and so cut
off from Scandinavian, Teutonic and Russian affairs, and brought into
the most intimate relations and conflicts with the French. For the next
four centuries the English were entangled in the conflicts of the
French feudal princes and wasted upon the fields of France.




XLVI
THE CRUSADES AND THE AGE OF PAPAL DOMINION


It is interesting to note that Charlemagne corresponded with the Caliph
Haroun-al-Raschid, the Haroun-al-Raschid of the _Arabian Nights_. It is
recorded that Haroun-al-Raschid sent ambassadors from Bagdad—which had
now replaced Damascus as the Moslem capital—with a splendid tent, a
water clock, an elephant and the keys of the Holy Sepulchre. This
latter present was admirably calculated to set the Byzantine Empire and
this new Holy Roman Empire by the ears as to which was the proper
protector of the Christians in Jerusalem.

These presents remind us that while Europe in the ninth century was
still a weltering disorder of war and pillage, there flourished a great
Arab Empire in Egypt and Mesopotamia, far more civilized than anything
Europe could show.  Here literature and science still lived; the arts
flourished, and the mind of man could move without fear or
superstition.  And even in Spain and North Africa where the Saracenic
dominions were falling into political confusion there was a vigorous
intellectual life.  Aristotle was read and discussed by these Jews and
Arabs during these centuries of European darkness.  They guarded the
neglected seeds of science and philosophy.

North-east of the Caliph’s dominions was a number of Turkish tribes. 
They had been converted to Islam, and they held the faith much more
simply and fiercely than the actively intellectual Arabs and Persians
to the south.  In the tenth century the Turks were growing strong and
vigorous while the Arab power was divided and decaying.  The relations
of the Turks to the Empire of the Caliphate became very similar to the
relations of the Medes to the last Babylonian Empire fourteen centuries
before.  In the eleventh century a group of Turkish tribes, the Seljuk
Turks, came down into Mesopotamia and made the Caliph their nominal
ruler but really their captive and tool.  They conquered Armenia.  Then
they struck at the remnants of the Byzantine power in Asia Minor.  In
1071 the Byzantine army was utterly smashed at the battle of Melasgird,
and the Turks swept forward until not a trace of Byzantine rule
remained in Asia. They took the fortress of Nicæa over against
Constantinople, and prepared to attempt that city.

The Byzantine emperor, Michael VII, was overcome with terror. He was
already heavily engaged in warfare with a band of Norman adventurers
who had seized Durazzo, and with a fierce Turkish people, the
Petschenegs, who were raiding over the Danube.  In his extremity he
sought help where he could, and it is notable that he did not appeal to
the western emperor but to the Pope of Rome as the head of Latin
Christendom.  He wrote to Pope Gregory VII, and his successor Alexius
Comnenus wrote still more urgently to Urban II.

This was not a quarter of a century from the rupture of the Latin and
Greek churches.  That controversy was still vividly alive in men’s
minds, and this disaster to Byzantium must have presented itself to the
Pope as a supreme opportunity for reasserting the supremacy of the
Latin Church over the dissentient Greeks.  Moreover this occasion gave
the Pope a chance to deal with two other matters that troubled western
Christendom very greatly.  One was the custom of “private war” which
disordered social life, and the other was the superabundant fighting
energy of the Low Germans and Christianized Northmen and particularly
of the Franks and Normans.  A religious war, the Crusade, the War of
the Cross, was preached against the Turkish captors of Jerusalem, and a
truce to all warfare amongst Christians (1095).  The declared object of
this war was the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre from the unbelievers. 
A man called Peter the Hermit carried on a popular propaganda
throughout France and Germany on broadly democratic lines. He went clad
in a coarse garment, barefooted on an ass, he carried a huge cross and
harangued the crowd in street or market-place or church.  He denounced
the cruelties practised upon the Christian pilgrims by the Turks, and
the shame of the Holy Sepulchre being in any but Christian hands.  The
fruits of centuries of Christian teaching became apparent in the
response.  A great wave of enthusiasm swept the western world, and
popular Christendom discovered itself.

Such a widespread uprising of the common people in relation to a single
idea as now occurred was a new thing in the history of our race.  There
is nothing to parallel it in the previous history of the Roman Empire
or of India or China. On a smaller scale, however, there had been
similar movements among the Jewish people after their liberation from
the Babylonian captivity, and later on Islam was to display a parallel
susceptibility to collective feeling.  Such movements were certainly
connected with the new spirit that had come into life with the
development of the missionary- teaching religions.  The Hebrew
prophets, Jesus and his disciples, Mani, Muhammad, were all exhorters
of men’s individual souls.  They brought the personal conscience face
to face with God.  Before that time religion had been much more a
business of fetish, of pseudoscience, than of conscience.  The old kind
of religion turned upon temple, initiated priest and mystical
sacrifice, and ruled the common man like a slave by fear.  The new kind
of religion made a man of him.

The preaching of the First Crusade was the first stirring of the common
people in European history.  It may be too much to call it the birth of
modern democracy, but certainly at that time modern democracy stirred. 
Before very long we shall find it stirring again, and raising the most
disturbing social and religious questions.

Certainly this first stirring of democracy ended very pitifully and
lamentably.  Considerable bodies of common people, crowds rather than
armies, set out eastward from France and the Rhineland and Central
Europe without waiting for leaders or proper equipment to rescue the
Holy Sepulchre. This was the “people’s crusade.”  Two great mobs
blundered into Hungary, mistook the recently converted Magyars for
pagans, committed atrocities and were massacred. A third multitude with
a similarly confused mind, after a great pogrom of the Jews in the
Rhineland, marched eastward, and was also destroyed in Hungary.  Two
other huge crowds, under the leadership of Peter the Hermit himself,
reached Constantinople, crossed the Bosphorus, and were massacred
rather than defeated by the Seljuk Turks.  So began and ended this
first movement of the European people, as people.

Next year (1097) the real fighting forces crossed the Bosphorus. 
Essentially they were Norman in leadership and spirit.  They stormed
Nicæa, marched by much the same route as Alexander had followed
fourteen centuries before, to Antioch.  The siege of Antioch kept them
a year, and in June 1099 they invested Jerusalem.  It was stormed after
a month’s siege.  The slaughter was terrible.  Men riding on horseback
were splashed by the blood in the streets.  At nightfall on July 15th
the Crusaders had fought their way into the Church of the Holy
Sepulchre and overcome all opposition there: blood-stained, weary and
“sobbing from excess of joy” they knelt down in prayer.

Immediately the hostility of Latin and Greek broke out again. The
Crusaders were the servants of the Latin Church, and the Greek
patriarch of Jerusalem found himself in a far worse case under the
triumphant Latins than under the Turks.  The Crusaders discovered
themselves between Byzantine and Turk and fighting both.  Much of Asia
Minor was recovered by the Byzantine Empire, and the Latin princes were
left, a buffer between Turk and Greek, with Jerusalem and a few small
principalities, of which Edessa was one of the chief, in Syria.  Their
grip even on these possessions was precarious, and in 1144 Edessa fell
to the Moslim, leading to an ineffective Second Crusade, which failed
to recover Edessa but saved Antioch from a similar fate.

In 1169 the forces of Islam were rallied under a Kurdish adventurer
named Saladin who had made himself master of Egypt.  He preached a Holy
War against the Christians, recaptured Jerusalem in 1187, and so
provoked the Third Crusade.  This failed to recover Jerusalem.  In the
Fourth Crusade (1202-4) the Latin Church turned frankly upon the Greek
Empire, and there was not even a pretence of fighting the Turks.  It
started from Venice and in 1204 it stormed Constantinople. The great
rising trading city of Venice was the leader in this adventure, and
most of the coasts and islands of the Byzantine Empire were annexed by
the Venetians.  A “Latin” emperor (Baldwin of Flanders) was set up in
Constantinople and the Latin and Greek Church were declared to be
reunited.  The Latin emperors ruled in Constantinople from 1204 to 1261
when the Greek world shook itself free again from Roman predominance.

The twelfth century then and the opening of the thirteenth was the age
of papal ascendancy just as the eleventh was the age of the ascendancy
of the Seljuk Turks and the tenth the age of the Northmen.  A united
Christendom under the rule of the Pope came nearer to being a working
reality than it ever was before or after that time.

In those centuries a simple Christian faith was real and widespread
over great areas of Europe.  Rome itself had passed through some dark
and discreditable phases; few writers can be found to excuse the lives
of Popes John XI and John XII in the tenth century; they were
abominable creatures; but the heart and body of Latin Christendom had
remained earnest and simple; the generality of the common priests and
monks and nuns had lived exemplary and faithful lives.  Upon the wealth
of confidence such lives created rested the power of the church.  Among
the great Popes of the past had been Gregory the Great, Gregory I
(590-604) and Leo III (795-816) who invited Charlemagne to be Cæsar and
crowned him in spite of himself.  Towards the close of the eleventh
century there arose a great clerical statesman, Hildebrand, who ended
his life as Pope Gregory VII (1073- 1085).  Next but one after him came
Urban II (1087-1099), the Pope of the First Crusade.  These two were
the founders of this period of papal greatness during which the Popes
lorded it over the Emperors.  From Bulgaria to Ireland and from Norway
to Sicily and Jerusalem the Pope was supreme.  Gregory VII obliged the
Emperor Henry IV to come in penitence to him at Canossa and to await
forgiveness for three days and nights in the courtyard of the castle,
clad in sackcloth and barefooted to the snow.  In 1176 at Venice the
Emperor Frederick (Frederick Barbarossa), knelt to Pope Alexander III
and swore fealty to him.

The great power of the church in the beginning of the eleventh century
lay in the wills and consciences of men.  It failed to retain the moral
prestige on which its power was based.  In the opening decades of the
fourteenth century it was discovered that the power of the Pope had
evaporated. What was it that destroyed the naive confidence of the
common people of Christendom in the church so that they would no longer
rally to its appeal and serve its purposes?

The first trouble was certainly the accumulation of wealth by the
church.  The church never died, and there was a frequent disposition on
the part of dying childless people to leave lands to the church. 
Penitent sinners were exhorted to do so.  Accordingly in many European
countries as much as a fourth of the land became church property.  The
appetite for property grows with what it feeds upon.  Already in the
thirteenth century it was being said everywhere that the priests were
not good men, that they were always hunting for money and legacies.

The kings and princes disliked this alienation of property very
greatly.  In the place of feudal lords capable of military support,
they found their land supporting abbeys and monks and nuns.  And these
lands were really under foreign dominion.  Even before the time of Pope
Gregory VII there had been a struggle between the princes and the
papacy over the question of “investitures,” the question that is of who
should appoint the bishops.  If that power rested with the Pope and not
the King, then the latter lost control not only of the consciences of
his subjects but of a considerable part of his dominions.  For also the
clergy claimed exemption from taxation.  They paid their taxes to Rome.
 And not only that, but the church also claimed the right to levy a tax
of one-tenth upon the property of the layman in addition to the taxes
he paid his prince.

The history of nearly every country in Latin Christendom tells of the
same phase in the eleventh century, a phase of struggle between monarch
and Pope on the issue of investitures and generally it tells of a
victory for the Pope.  He claimed to be able to excommunicate the
prince, to absolve his subjects from their allegiance to him, to
recognize a successor.  He claimed to be able to put a nation under an
interdict, and then nearly all priestly functions ceased except the
sacraments of baptism, confirmation and penance; the priests could
neither hold the ordinary services, marry people, nor bury the dead. 
With these two weapons it was possible for the twelfth century Popes to
curb the most recalcitrant princes and overawe the most restive
peoples.  These were enormous powers, and enormous powers are only to
be used on extraordinary occasions.  The Popes used them at last with a
frequency that staled their effect.  Within thirty years at the end of
the twelfth century we find Scotland, France and England in turn under
an interdict.  And also the Popes could not resist the temptation to
preach crusades against offending princes—until the crusading spirit
was extinct.

It is possible that if the Church of Rome had struggled simply against
the princes and had had a care to keep its hold upon the general mind,
it might have achieved a permanent dominion over all Christendom.  But
the high claims of the Pope were reflected as arrogance in the conduct
of the clergy.  Before the eleventh century the Roman priests could
marry; they had close ties with the people among whom they lived; they
were indeed a part of the people.  Gregory VII made them celibates; he
cut the priests off from too great an intimacy with the laymen in order
to bind them more closely to Rome, but indeed he opened a fissure
between the church and the commonalty.  The church had its own law
courts. Cases involving not merely priests but monks, students,
crusaders, widows, orphans and the helpless were reserved for the
clerical courts, and so were all matters relating to wills, marriages
and oaths and all cases of sorcery, heresy and blasphemy.  Whenever the
layman found himself in conflict with the priest he had to go to a
clerical court.  The obligations of peace and war fell upon his
shoulders alone and left the priest free.  It is no great wonder that
jealousy and hatred of the priests grew up in the Christian world.

Never did Rome seem to realize that its power was in the consciences of
common men.  It fought against religious enthusiasm, which should have
been its ally, and it forced doctrinal orthodoxy upon honest doubt and
aberrant opinion. When the church interfered in matters of morality it
had the common man with it, but not when it interfered in matters of
doctrine.  When in the south of France Waldo taught a return to the
simplicity of Jesus in faith and life, Innocent III preached a crusade
against the Waldenses, Waldo’s followers, and permitted them to be
suppressed with fire, sword, rape and the most abominable cruelties. 
When again St. Francis of Assisi (1181-1226) taught the imitation of
Christ and a life of poverty and service, his followers, the
Franciscans, were persecuted, scourged, imprisoned and dispersed.  In
1318 four of them were burnt alive at Marseilles.  On the other hand
the fiercely orthodox order of the Dominicans, founded by St. Dominic
(1170-1221) was strongly supported by Innocent III, who with its
assistance set up an organization, the Inquisition, for the hunting of
heresy and the affliction of free thought.

So it was that the church by excessive claims, by unrighteous
privileges, and by an irrational intolerance destroyed that free faith
of the common man which was the final source of all its power.  The
story of its decline tells of no adequate foemen from without but
continually of decay from within.




XLVII
RECALCITRANT PRINCES AND THE GREAT SCHISM


One very great weakness of the Roman Church in its struggle to secure
the headship of all Christendom was the manner in which the Pope was
chosen.

If indeed the papacy was to achieve its manifest ambition and establish
one rule and one peace throughout Christendom, then it was vitally
necessary that it should have a strong, steady and continuous
direction.  In those great days of its opportunity it needed before all
things that the Popes when they took office should be able men in the
prime of life, that each should have his successor-designate with whom
he could discuss the policy of the church, and that the forms and
processes of election should be clear, definite, unalterable and
unassailable.  Unhappily none of these things obtained.  It was not
even clear who could vote in the election of a Pope, nor whether the
Byzantine or Holy Roman Emperor had a voice in the matter.  That very
great papal statesman Hildebrand (Pope Gregory VII, 1073-1085) did much
to regularize the election.  He confined the votes to the Roman
cardinals and he reduced the Emperor’s share to a formula of assent
conceded to him by the church, but he made no provision for a
successor-designate and he left it possible for the disputes of the
cardinals to keep the See vacant, as in some cases it was kept vacant,
for a year or more.

The consequences of this want of firm definition are to be seen in the
whole history of the papacy up to the sixteenth century.  From quite
early times onward there were disputed elections and two or more men
each claiming to be Pope.  The church would then be subjected to the
indignity of going to the Emperor or some other outside arbiter to
settle the dispute.  And the career of everyone of the great Popes
ended in a note of interrogation.  At his death the church might be
left headless and as ineffective as a decapitated body.  Or he might be
replaced by some old rival eager only to discredit and undo his work. 
Or some enfeebled old man tottering on the brink of the grave might
succeed him.

It was inevitable that this peculiar weakness of the papal organization
should attract the interference of the various German princes, the
French King, and the Norman and French Kings who ruled in England; that
they should all try to influence the elections, and have a Pope in
their own interest established in the Lateran Palace at Rome.  And the
more powerful and important the Pope became in European affairs, the
more urgent did these interventions become. Under the circumstances it
is no great wonder that many of the Popes were weak and futile.  The
astonishing thing is that many of them were able and courageous men.

One of the most vigorous and interesting of the Popes of this great
period was Innocent III (1198-1216) who was so fortunate as to become
Pope before he was thirty-eight.  He and his successors were pitted
against an even more interesting personality, the Emperor Frederick II;
_Stupor mundi_ he was called, the Wonder of the world.  The struggle of
this monarch against Rome is a turning place in history.  In the end
Rome defeated him and destroyed his dynasty, but he left the prestige
of the church and Pope so badly wounded that its wounds festered and
led to its decay.

Frederick was the son of the Emperor Henry VI and his mother was the
daughter of Roger I, the Norman King of Sicily.  He inherited this
kingdom in 1198 when he was a child of four years.  Innocent III had
been made his guardian.  Sicily in those days had been but recently
conquered by the Normans; the Court was half oriental and full of
highly educated Arabs; and some of these were associated in the
education of the young king.  No doubt they were at some pains to make
their point of view clear to him.  He got a Moslem view of Christianity
as well as a Christian view of Islam, and the unhappy result of this
double system of instruction was a view, exceptional in that age of
faith, that all religions were impostures.  He talked freely on the
subject; his heresies and blasphemies are on record.

As the young man grew up he found himself in conflict with his
guardian.  Innocent III wanted altogether too much from his ward.  When
the opportunity came for Frederick to succeed as Emperor, the Pope
intervened with conditions.  Frederick must promise to put down heresy
in Germany with a strong hand. Moreover he must relinquish his crown in
Sicily and South Italy, because otherwise he would be too strong for
the Pope.  And the German clergy were to be freed from all taxation. 
Frederick agreed but with no intention of keeping his word.  The Pope
had already induced the French King to make war upon his own subjects
in France, the cruel and bloody crusade against the Waldenses; he
wanted Frederick to do the same thing in Germany.  But Frederick being
far more of a heretic than any of the simple pietists who had incurred
the Pope’s animosity, lacked the crusading impulse.  And when Innocent
urged him to crusade against the Moslim and recover Jerusalem he was
equally ready to promise and equally slack in his performance.

Having secured the imperial crown Frederick II stayed in Sicily, which
he greatly preferred to Germany as a residence, and did nothing to
redeem any of his promises to Innocent III, who died baffled in 1216.

Honorius III, who succeeded Innocent, could do no better with
Frederick, and Gregory IX (1227) came to the papal throne evidently
resolved to settle accounts with this young man at any cost.  He
excommunicated him.  Frederick II was denied all the comforts of
religion.  In the half-Arab Court of Sicily this produced singularly
little discomfort.  And also the Pope addressed a public letter to the
Emperor reciting his vices (which were indisputable), his heresies, and
his general misconduct.  To this Frederick replied in a document of
diabolical ability.  It was addressed to all the princes of Europe, and
it made the first clear statement of the issue between the Pope and the
princes.  He made a shattering attack upon the manifest ambition of the
Pope to become the absolute ruler of all Europe.  He suggested a union
of princes against this usurpation.   He directed the attention of the
princes specifically to the wealth of the church.

Having fired off this deadly missile Frederick resolved to perform his
twelve-year-old promise and go upon a crusade. This was the Sixth
Crusade (1228).  It was as a crusade, farcical.  Frederick II went to
Egypt and met and discussed affairs with the Sultan.  These two
gentlemen, both of sceptical opinions, exchanged congenial views, made
a commercial convention to their mutual advantage, and agreed to
transfer Jerusalem to Frederick.  This indeed was a new sort of
crusade, a crusade by private treaty.  Here was no blood splashing the
conqueror, no “weeping with excess of joy.”  As this astonishing
crusader was an excommunicated man, he had to be content with a purely
secular coronation as King of Jerusalem, taking the crown from the
altar with his own hand—for all the clergy were bound to shun him.  He
then returned to Italy, chased the papal armies which had invaded his
dominions back to their own territories, and obliged the Pope to grant
him absolution from his excommunication.  So a prince might treat the
Pope in the thirteenth century, and there was now no storm of popular
indignation to avenge him.  Those days were past.

In 1239 Gregory IX resumed his struggle with Frederick, excommunicated
him for a second time, and renewed that warfare of public abuse in
which the papacy had already suffered severely.  The controversy was
revived after Gregory IX was dead, when Innocent IV was Pope; and again
a devastating letter, which men were bound to remember, was written by
Frederick against the church.  He denounced the pride and irreligion of
the clergy, and ascribed all the corruptions of the time to their pride
and wealth.  He proposed to his fellow princes a general confiscation
of church property—for the good of the church.  It was a suggestion
that never afterwards left the imagination of the European princes.

We will not go on to tell of his last years.  The particular events of
his life are far less significant than its general atmosphere.  It is
possible to piece together something of his court life in Sicily.  He
was luxurious in his way of living, and fond of beautiful things.  He
is described as licentious.  But it is clear that he was a man of very
effectual curiosity and inquiry.  He gathered Jewish and Moslem as well
as Christian philosophers at his court, and he did much to irrigate the
Italian mind with Saracenic influences.  Through him the Arabic
numerals and algebra were introduced to Christian students, and among
other philosophers at his court was Michael Scott, who translated
portions of Aristotle and the commentaries thereon of the great Arab
philosopher Averroes (of Cordoba).  In 1224 Frederick founded the
University of Naples, and he enlarged and enriched the great medical
school at Salerno University. He also founded a zoological garden.  He
left a book on hawking, which shows him to have been an acute observer
of the habits of birds, and he was one of the first Italians to write
Italian verse.  Italian poetry was indeed born at his court.  He has
been called by an able writer, “the first of the moderns,” and the
phrase expresses aptly the unprejudiced detachment of his intellectual
side.

A still more striking intimation of the decay of the living and
sustaining forces of the papacy appeared when presently the Popes came
into conflict with the growing power of the French King.  During the
lifetime of the Emperor Frederick II, Germany fell into disunion, and
the French King began to play the rôle of guard, supporter and rival to
the Pope that had hitherto fallen to the Hohenstaufen Emperors.  A
series of Popes pursued the policy of supporting the French monarchs. 
French princes were established in the kingdom of Sicily and Naples,
with the support and approval of Rome, and the French Kings saw before
them the possibility of restoring and ruling the Empire of Charlemagne.
 When, however, the German interregnum after the death of Frederick II,
the last of the Hohenstaufens, came to all end and Rudolf of Habsburg
was elected first Habsburg Emperor (1273), the policy of Rome began to
fluctuate between France and Germany, veering about with the sympathies
of each successive Pope.  In the East in 1261 the Greeks recaptured
Constantinople from the Latin emperors, and the founder of the new
Greek dynasty, Michael Palæologus, Michael VIII, after some unreal
tentatives of reconciliation with the Pope, broke away from the Roman
communion altogether, and with that, and the fall of the Latin kingdoms
in Asia, the eastward ascendancy of the Popes came to an end.

In 1294 Boniface VIII became Pope.  He was an Italian, hostile to the
French, and full of a sense of the great traditions and mission of
Rome.  For a time he carried things with a high hand.  In 1300 he held
a jubilee, and a vast multitude of pilgrims assembled in Rome.  “So
great was the influx of money into the papal treasury, that two
assistants were kept busy with the rakes collecting the offerings that
were deposited at the tomb of St. Peter.” [1] But this festival was a
delusive triumph.  Boniface came into conflict with the French King in
1302, and in 1303, as he was about to pronounce sentence of
excommunication against that monarch, he was surprised and arrested in
his own ancestral palace at Anagni, by Guillaume de Nogaret.  This
agent from the French King forced an entrance into the palace, made his
way into the bedroom of the frightened Pope—he was lying in bed with a
cross in his hands—and heaped threats and insults upon him.  The Pope
was liberated a day or so later by the townspeople, and returned to
Rome; but there he was seized upon and again made prisoner by the
Orsini family, and in a few weeks’ time the shocked and disillusioned
old man died a prisoner in their hands.

The people of Anagni did resent the first outrage, and rose against
Nogaret to liberate Boniface, but then Anagni was the Pope’s native
town.  The important point to note is that the French King in this
rough treatment of the head of Christendom was acting with the full
approval of his people; he had summoned a council of the Three Estates
of France (lords, church and commons) and gained their consent before
proceeding to extremities.  Neither in Italy, Germany nor England was
there the slightest general manifestation of disapproval at this free
handling of the sovereign pontiff. The idea of Christendom had decayed
until its power over the minds of men had gone.

Throughout the fourteenth century the papacy did nothing to recover its
moral sway.  The next Pope elected, Clement V, was a Frenchman, the
choice of King Philip of France.  He never came to Rome.  He set up his
court in the town of Avignon, which then belonged not to France but to
the papal See, though embedded in French territory, and there his
successors remained until 1377, when Pope Gregory XI returned to the
Vatican palace in Rome.  But Gregory XI did not take the sympathies of
the whole church with him.  Many of the cardinals were of French origin
and their habits and associations were rooted deep at Avignon.  When in
1378 Gregory XI died, and an Italian, Urban VI, was elected, these
dissentient cardinals declared the election invalid, and elected
another Pope, the anti-Pope, Clement VII.  This split is called the
Great Schism.  The Popes remained in Rome, and all the anti-French
powers, the Emperor, the King of England, Hungary, Poland and the North
of Europe were loyal to them. The anti-Popes, on the other hand,
continued in Avignon, and were supported by the King of France, his
ally the King of Scotland, Spain, Portugal and various German princes. 
Each Pope excommunicated and cursed the adherents of his rival
(1378-1417).

Is it any wonder that presently all over Europe people began to think
for themselves in matters of religion?

The beginnings of the Franciscans and the Dominicans, which we have
noted in the preceding chapters, were but two among many of the new
forces that were arising in Christendom, either to hold or shatter the
church as its own wisdom might decide. Those two orders the church did
assimilate and use, though with a little violence in the case of the
former.  But other forces were more frankly disobedient and critical. 
A century and a half later came Wycliffe (1320-1384). He was a learned
Doctor at Oxford.  Quite late in his life he began a series of
outspoken criticisms of the corruption of the clergy and the unwisdom
of the church.  He organized a number of poor priests, the Wycliffites,
to spread his ideas throughout England; and in order that people should
judge between the church and himself, he translated the Bible into
English.  He was a more learned and far abler man than either St.
Francis or St. Dominic.  He had supporters in high places and a great
following among the people; and though Rome raged against him, and
ordered his imprisonment, he died a free man.  But the black and
ancient spirit that was leading the Catholic Church to its destruction
would not let his bones rest in the grave.  By a decree of the Council
of Constance in 1415, his remains were ordered to be dug up and burnt,
an order which was carried out at the command of Pope Martin V by
Bishop Fleming in 1428.  This desecration was not the act of some
isolated fanatic; it was the official act of the church.

XLVIII
THE MONGOL CONQUESTS


But in the thirteenth century, while this strange and finally
ineffectual struggle to unify Christendom under the rule of the Pope
was going on in Europe, far more momentous events were afoot upon the
larger stage of Asia. A Turkish people from the country to the north of
China rose suddenly to prominence in the world’s affairs, and achieved
such a series of conquests as has no parallel in history. These were
the Mongols. At the opening of the thirteenth century they were a horde
of nomadic horsemen, living very much as their predecessors, the Huns,
had done, subsisting chiefly upon meat and mare’s milk and living in
tents of skin. They had shaken themselves free from Chinese dominion,
and brought a number of other Turkish tribes into a military
confederacy. Their central camp was at Karakorum in Mongolia.

At this time China was in a state of division.  The great dynasty of
Tang had passed into decay by the tenth century, and after a phase of
division into warring states, three main empires, that of Kin in the
north with Pekin as its capital and that of Sung in the south with a
capital at Nankin, and Hsia in the centre, remain.  In 1214 Jengis
Khan, the leader of the Mongol confederates, made war on the Kin Empire
and captured Pekin (1214).  He then turned westward and conquered
Western Turkestan, Persia, Armenia, India down to Lahore, and South
Russia as far as Kieff.  He died master of a vast empire that reached
from the Pacific to the Dnieper.

His successor, Ogdai Khan, continued this astonishing career of
conquest.  His armies were organized to a very high level of
efficiency; and they had with them a new Chinese invention, gunpowder,
which they used in small field guns. He completed the conquest of the
Kin Empire and then swept his hosts right across Asia to Russia (1235),
an altogether amazing march.  Kieff was destroyed in 1240, and nearly
all Russia became tributary to the Mongols.  Poland was ravaged, and a
mixed army of Poles and Germans was annihilated at the battle of
Liegnitz in Lower Silesia in 1241.  The Emperor Frederick II does not
seem to have made any great efforts to stay the advancing tide.


Map: The Ottoman Empire before 1453

“It is only recently,” says Bury in his notes to Gibbon’s _Decline and
Fall of the Roman Empire_, “that European history has begun to
understand that the successes of the Mongol army which overran Poland
and occupied Hungary in the spring of A.D. 1241 were won by consummate
strategy and were not due to a mere overwhelming superiority of
numbers.  But this fact has not yet become a matter of common
knowledge; the vulgar opinion which represents the Tartars as a wild
horde carrying all before them solely by their multitude, and galloping
through Eastern Europe without a strategic plan, rushing at all
obstacles and overcoming them by mere weight, still prevails. . . .

“It was wonderful how punctually and effectually the arrangements were
carried out in operations extending from the Lower Vistula to
Transylvania.  Such a campaign was quite beyond the power of any
European army of the time, and it was beyond the vision of any European
commander. There was no general in Europe, from Frederick II downward,
who was not a tyro in strategy compared to Subutai.  It should also be
noticed that the Mongols embarked upon the enterprise with full
knowledge of the political situation of Hungary and the condition of
Poland—they had taken care to inform themselves by a well-organized
system of spies; on the other hand, the Hungarians and the Christian
powers, like childish barbarians, knew hardly anything about their
enemies.”


Map: The Empire of Jengis Khan at his death (1227)

But though the Mongols were victorious at Liegnitz, they did not
continue their drive westward.  They were getting into woodlands and
hilly country, which did not suit their tactics; and so they turned
southward and prepared to settle in Hungary, massacring or assimilating
the kindred Magyar, even as these had previously massacred and
assimilated the mixed Scythians and Avars and Huns before them.  From
the Hungarian plain they would probably have made raids west and south
as the Hungarians had done in the ninth century, the Avars in the
seventh and eighth and the Huns in the fifth. But Ogdai died suddenly,
and in 1242 there was trouble about the succession, and recalled by
this, the undefeated hosts of Mongols began to pour back across Hungary
and Roumania towards the east.

Thereafter the Mongols concentrated their attention upon their Asiatic
conquests.  By the middle of the thirteenth century they had conquered
the Sung Empire.  Mangu Khan succeeded Ogdai Khan as Great Khan in
1251, and made his brother Kublai Khan governor of China.  In 1280
Kublai Khan had been formally recognized Emperor of China, and so
founded the Yuan dynasty which lasted until 1368.  While the last ruins
of the Sung rule were going down in China, another brother of Mangu,
Hulagu, was conquering Persia and Syria. The Mongols displayed a bitter
animosity to Islam at this time, and not only massacred the population
of Bagdad when they captured that city, but set to work to destroy the
immemorial irrigation system which had kept Mesopotamia incessantly
prosperous and populous from the early days of Sumeria.  From that time
until our own Mesopotamia has been a desert of ruins, sustaining only a
scanty population.  Into Egypt the Mongols never penetrated; the Sultan
of Egypt completely defeated an army of Hulagu’s in Palestine in 1260.

After that disaster the tide of Mongol victory ebbed.  The dominions of
the Great Khan fell into a number of separate states.  The eastern
Mongols became Buddhists, like the Chinese; the western became Moslim. 
The Chinese threw off the rule of the Yuan dynasty in 1368, and set up
the native Ming dynasty which flourished from 1368 to 1644.  The
Russians remained tributary to the Tartar hordes upon the south-east
steppes until 1480, when the Grand Duke of Moscow repudiated his
allegiance and laid the foundation of modern Russia.


TARTAR HORSEMEN

_(From a Chinese Print in the British Museum) _


In the fourteenth century there was a brief revival of Mongol vigour
under Timurlane, a descendant of Jengis Khan.  He established himself
in Western Turkestan, assumed the title of Grand Khan in 1369, and
conquered from Syria to Delhi.  He was the most savage and destructive
of all the Mongol conquerors.  He established an empire of desolation
that did not survive his death.  In 1505, however, a descendant of this
Timur, an adventurer named Baber, got together an army with guns and
swept down upon the plains of India.  His grandson Akbar (1556-1605)
completed his conquests, and this Mongol (or “Mogul” as the Arabs
called it) dynasty ruled in Delhi over the greater part of India until
the eighteenth century.

A.D.

One of the consequences of the first great sweep of Mongol conquest in
the thirteenth century was to drive a certain tribe of Turks, the
Ottoman Turks, out of Turkestan into Asia Minor.  They extended and
consolidated their power in Asia Minor, crossed the Dardanelles and
conquered Macedonia, Serbia and Bulgaria, until at last Constantinople
remained like an island amongst the Ottoman dominions.  In 1453 the
Ottoman Sultan, Muhammad II, took Constantinople, attacking it from the
European side with a great number of guns.  This event caused intense
excitement in Europe and there was talk of a crusade, but the day of
the crusades was past.

In the course of the sixteenth century the Ottoman Sultans conquered
Bagdad, Hungary, Egypt and most of North Africa, and their fleet made
them masters of the Mediterranean.  They very nearly took Vienna, and
they exacted it tribute from the Emperor.  There were but two items to
offset the general ebb of Christian dominion in the fifteenth century. 
One was the restoration of the independence of Moscow (1480); the other
was the gradual reconquest of Spain by the Christians. In 1492,
Granada, the last Moslem state in the peninsula, fell to King Ferdinand
of Aragon and his Queen Isabella of Castile.

But it was not until as late as 1571 that the naval battle of Lepanto
broke the prick of the Ottomans, and restored the Mediterranean waters
to Christian ascendancy.




XLIX
THE INTELLECTUAL REVIVAL OF THE EUROPEANS


Throughout the twelfth century there were many signs that the European
intelligence was recovering courage and leisure, and preparing to take
up again the intellectual enterprises of the first Greek scientific
enquiries and such speculations as those of the Italian Lucretius. The
causes of this revival were many and complex. The suppression of
private war, the higher standards of comfort and security that followed
the crusades, and the stimulation of men’s minds by the experiences of
these expeditions were no doubt necessary preliminary conditions. Trade
was reviving; cities were recovering ease and safety; the standard of
education was arising in the church and spreading among laymen. The
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries were a period of growing,
independent or quasi-independent cities; Venice, Florence, Genoa,
Lisbon, Paris, Bruges, London, Antwerp, Hamburg, Nuremberg, Novgorod,
Wisby and Bergen for example. They were all trading cities with many
travellers, and where men trade and travel they talk and think. The
polemics of the Popes and princes, the conspicuous savagery and
wickedness of the persecution of heretics, were exciting men to doubt
the authority of the church and question and discuss fundamental
things.

We have seen how the Arabs were the means of restoring Aristotle to
Europe, and how such a prince as Frederick II acted as a channel
through which Arabic philosophy and science played upon the renascent
European mind.  Still more influential in the stirring up of men’s
ideas were the Jews.  Their very existence was a note of interrogation
to the claims of the church.  And finally the secret, fascinating
enquiries of the alchemists were spreading far and wide and setting men
to the petty, furtive and yet fruitful resumption of experimental
science.

And the stir in men’s minds was by no means confined now to the
independent and well educated.  The mind of the common man was awake in
the world as it had never been before in all the experience of mankind.
 In spite of priest and persecution, Christianity does seem to have
carried a mental ferment wherever its teaching reached.  It established
a direct relation between the conscience of the individual man and the
God of Righteousness, so that now if need arose he had the courage to
form his own judgment upon prince or prelate or creed.

As early as the eleventh century philosophical discussion had begun
again in Europe, and there were great and growing universities at
Paris, Oxford, Bologna and other centres. There medieval “schoolmen”
took up again and thrashed out a series of questions upon the value and
meaning of words that were a necessary preliminary to clear thinking in
the scientific age that was to follow.  And standing by himself because
of his distinctive genius was Roger Bacon (circa 1210 to circa 1293), a
Franciscan of Oxford, the father of modern experimental science.  His
name deserves a prominence in our history second only to that of
Aristotle.

His writings are one long tirade against ignorance.  He told his age it
was ignorant, an incredibly bold thing to do. Nowadays a man may tell
the world it is as silly as it is solemn, that all its methods are
still infantile and clumsy and its dogmas childish assumptions, without
much physical danger; but these peoples of the middle ages when they
were not actually being massacred or starving or dying of pestilence,
were passionately convinced of the wisdom, the completeness and
finality of their beliefs, and disposed to resent any reflections upon
them very bitterly.  Roger Bacon’s writings were like a flash of light
in a profound darkness.  He combined his attack upon the ignorance of
his times with a wealth of suggestion for the increase of knowledge. 
In his passionate insistence upon the need of experiment and of
collecting knowledge, the spirit of Aristotle lives again in him. 
“Experiment, experiment,” that is the burthen of Roger Bacon.

Yet of Aristotle himself Roger Bacon fell foul.  He fell foul of him
because men, instead of facing facts boldly, sat in rooms and pored
over the bad Latin translations which were then all that was available
of the master. “If I had my way,” he wrote, in his intemperate fashion,
“I should burn all the books of Aristotle, for the study of them can
only lead to a loss of time, produce error, and increase ignorance,” a
sentiment that Aristotle would probably have echoed could he have
returned to a world in which his works were not so much read as
worshipped—and that, as Roger Bacon showed, in these most abominable
translations.

_(From an old print) _


Throughout his books, a little disguised by the necessity of seeming to
square it all with orthodoxy for fear of the prison and worse, Roger
Bacon shouted to mankind, “Cease to be ruled by dogmas and authorities;
_look at the world!_” Four chief sources of ignorance he denounced;
respect for authority, custom, the sense of the ignorant crowd, and the
vain, proud unteachableness of our dispositions.  Overcome but these,
and a world of power would open to men: —

“Machines for navigating are possible without rowers, so that great
ships suited to river or ocean, guided by one man, may be borne with
greater speed than if they were full of men.  Likewise cars may be made
so that without a draught animal they may be moved _cum impetu
inœstimable_, as we deem the scythed chariots to have been from which
antiquity fought.  And flying machines are possible, so that a man may
sit in the middle turning some device by which artificial wings may
beat the air in the manner of a flying bird.”

So Roger Bacon wrote, but three more centuries were to elapse before
men began any systematic attempts to explore the hidden stores of power
and interest he realized so clearly existed beneath the dull surface of
human affairs.

But the Saracenic world not only gave Christendom the stimulus of its
philosophers and alchemists; it also gave it paper.  It is scarcely too
much to say that paper made the intellectual revival of Europe
possible.  Paper originated in China, where its use probably goes back
to the second century B.C.  In 751 the Chinese made an attack upon the
Arab Moslems in Samarkand; they were repulsed, and among the prisoners
taken from them were some skilled papermakers, from whom the art was
learnt.  Arabic paper manuscripts from the ninth century onward still
exist. The manufacture entered Christendom either through Greece or by
the capture of Moorish paper-mills during the Christian reconquest of
Spain.  But under the Christian Spanish the product deteriorated sadly.
 Good paper was not made in Christian Europe until the end of the
thirteenth century, and then it was Italy which led the world.  Only by
the fourteenth century did the manufacture reach Germany, and not until
the end of that century was it abundant and cheap enough for the
printing of books to be a practicable business proposition.  Thereupon
printing followed naturally and necessarily, for printing is the most
obvious of inventions, and the intellectual life of the world entered
upon a new and far more vigorous phase.  It ceased to be a little
trickle from mind to mind; it became a broad flood, in which thousands
and presently scores and hundreds of thousands of minds participated.

One immediate result of this achievement of printing was the appearance
of an abundance of Bibles in the world.  Another was a cheapening of
school-books.  The knowledge of reading spread swiftly.  There was not
only a great increase of books in the world, but the books that were
now made were plainer to read and so easier to understand.  Instead of
toiling at a crabbed text arid then thinking over its significance,
readers now could think unimpeded as they read.  With this increase in
the facility of reading, the reading public grew. The book ceased to be
a highly decorated toy or a scholar’s mystery.  People began to write
books to be read as well as looked at by ordinary people.  They wrote
in the ordinary language and not in Latin.  With the fourteenth century
the real history of the European literature begins.

So far we have been dealing only with the Saracenic share in the
European revival.  Let us turn now to the influence of the Mongol
conquests.  They stimulated the geographical imagination of Europe
enormously.  For a time under the Great Khan, all Asia and Western
Europe enjoyed an open intercourse; all the roads were temporarily
open, and representatives of every nation appeared at the court of
Karakorum.  The barriers between Europe and Asia set up by the
religious feud of Christianity and Islam were lowered. Great hopes were
entertained by the papacy for the conversion of the Mongols to
Christianity.  Their only religion so far had been Shumanism, a
primitive paganism.  Envoys of the Pope, Buddhist priests from India,
Parisian and Italian and Chinese artificers, Byzantine and Armenian
merchants, mingled with Arab officials and Persian and Indian
astronomers and mathematicians at the Mongol court.  We hear too much
in history of the campaigns and massacres of the Mongols, and not
enough of their curiosity and desire for learning.  Not perhaps as an
originative people, but as transmitters of knowledge and method their
influence upon the world’s history has been very great.  And everything
one can learn of the vague and romantic personalities of Jengis or
Kublai tends to confirm the impression that these men were at least as
understanding and creative monarchs as either that flamboyant but
egotistical figure Alexander the Great or that raiser of political
ghosts, that energetic but illiterate theologian Charlemagne.

One of the most interesting of these visitors to the Mongol Court was a
certain Venetian, Marco Polo, who afterwards set down his story in a
book.  He went to China about 1272 with his father and uncle, who had
already once made the journey. The Great Khan had been deeply impressed
by the elder Polos; they were the first men of the “Latin” peoples he
had seen; and he sent them back with enquiries for teachers and learned
men who could explain Christianity to him, and for various other
European things that had aroused his curiosity.  Their visit with Marco
was their second visit.

The three Polos started by way of Palestine and not by the Crimea, as
in their previous expedition.  They had with them a gold tablet and
other indications from the Great Khan that must have greatly
facilitated their journey.  The Great Khan had asked for some oil from
the lamp that burns in the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem; and so thither
they first went, and then by way of Cilicia into Armenia.  They went
thus far north because the Sultan of Egypt was raiding the Mongol
domains at this time.  Thence they came by way of Mesopotamia to Ormuz
on the Persian Gulf, as if they contemplated a sea voyage.  At Ormuz
they met merchants from India.  For some reason they did not take ship,
but instead turned northward through the Persian deserts, and so by way
of Balkh over the Pamir to Kashgar, and by way of Kotan and the Lob Nor
into the Hwang-ho valley and on to Pekin.  At Pekin was the Great Khan,
and they were hospitably entertained.

Marco particularly pleased Kublai; he was young and clever, and it is
clear he had mastered the Tartar language very thoroughly.  He was
given an official position and sent on several missions, chiefly in
south-west China.  The tale he had to tell of vast stretches of smiling
and prosperous country, “all the way excellent hostelries for
travellers,” and “fine vineyards, fields, and gardens,” of “many
abbeys” of Buddhist monks, of manufactures of “cloth of silk and gold
and many fine taffetas,” a “constant succession of cities and
boroughs,” and so on, first roused the incredulity and then fired the
imagination of all Europe.  He told of Burmah, and of its great armies
with hundreds of elephants, and how these animals were defeated by the
Mongol bowmen, and also of the Mongol conquest of Pegu.  He told of
Japan, and greatly exaggerated the amount of gold in that country.  For
three years Marco ruled the city of Yang-chow as governor, and he
probably impressed the Chinese inhabitants as being little more of a
foreigner than any Tartar would have been.  He may also have been sent
on a mission to India.  Chinese records mention a certain Polo attached
to the imperial council in 1277, a very valuable confirmation of the
general truth of the Polo story.

The publication of Marco Polo’s travels produced a profound effect upon
the European imagination.  The European literature, and especially the
European romance of the fifteenth century, echoes with the names in
Marco Polo’s story, with Cathay (North China) and Cambulac (Pekin) and
the like.

Two centuries later, among the readers of the Travels of Marco Polo was
a certain Genoese mariner, Christopher Columbus, who conceived the
brilliant idea of sailing westward round the world to China.  In
Seville there is a copy of the Travels with marginal notes by Columbus.
There were many reasons why the thought of a Genoese should be turned
in this direction.  Until its capture by the Turks in 1453
Constantinople had been an impartial trading mart between the Western
world and the East, and the Genoese had traded there freely.  But the
“Latin” Venetians, the bitter rivals of the Genoese, had been the
allies and helpers of the Turks against the Greeks, and with the coming
of the Turks Constantinople turned an unfriendly face upon Genoese
trade.  The long forgotten discovery that the world was round had
gradually resumed its sway over men’s minds.  The idea of going
westward to China was therefore a fairly obvious one.  It was
encouraged by two things.  The mariner’s compass had now been invented
and men were no longer left to the mercy of a fine night and the stars
to determine the direction in which they were sailing, and the Normans,
Catalonians and Genoese and Portuguese had already pushed out into the
Atlantic as far as the Canary Isles, Madeira and the Azores.

Yet Columbus found many difficulties before he could get ships to put
his idea to the test.  He went from one European Court to another. 
Finally at Granada, just won from the Moors, he secured the patronage
of Ferdinand and Isabella, and was able to set out across the unknown
ocean in three small ships.  After a voyage of two months and nine days
he came to a land which he believed to be India, but which was really a
new continent, whose distinct existence the old world had never
hitherto suspected.  He returned to Spain with gold, cotton, strange
beasts and birds, and two wild- eyed painted Indians to be baptized. 
They were called Indians because, to the end of his days, he believed
that this land he had found was India.  Only in the course of several
years did men begin to realize that the whole new continent of America
was added to the world’s resources.

The success of Columbus stimulated overseas enterprise enormously.  In
1497 the Portuguese sailed round Africa to India, and in 1515 there
were Portuguese ships in Java.  In 1519 Magellan, a Portuguese sailor
in Spanish employment, sailed out of Seville westward with five ships,
of which one, the _Vittoria_, came back up the river to Seville in
1522, the first ship that had ever circumnavigated the world.
Thirty-one men were aboard her, survivors of two-hundred-and- eighty
who had started.  Magellan himself had been killed in the Philippine
Isles.

Printed paper books, a new realization of the round world as a thing
altogether attainable, a new vision of strange lands, strange animals
and plants, strange manners and customs, discoveries overseas and in
the skies and in the ways and materials of life burst upon the European
mind. The Greek classics, buried and forgotten for so long, were
speedily being printed and studied, and were colouring men’s thoughts
with the dreams of Plato and the traditions of an age of republican
freedom and dignity.  The Roman dominion had first brought law and
order to Western Europe, and the Latin Church had restored it; but
under both Pagan and Catholic Rome curiosity and innovation were
subordinate to and restrained by organization.  The reign of the Latin
mind was now drawing to an end.  Between the thirteenth and the
sixteenth century the European Aryans, thanks to the stimulating
influence of Semite and Mongol and the rediscovery of the Greek
classics, broke away from the Latin tradition and rose again to the
intellectual and material leadership of mankind.




L
THE REFORMATION OF THE LATIN CHURCH


The Latin Church itself was enormously affected by this mental rebirth.
It was dismembered; and even the portion that survived was extensively
renewed.

We have told how nearly the church came to the autocratic leadership of
all Christendom in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, and how in the
fourteenth and fifteenth its power over men’s minds and affairs
declined.  We have described how popular religious enthusiasm which had
in earlier ages been its support and power was turned against it by its
pride, persecutions and centralization, and how the insidious
scepticism of Frederick II bore fruit in a growing insubordination of
the princes.  The Great Schism had reduced its religious and political
prestige to negligible proportions.  The forces of insurrection struck
it now from both sides.

The teachings of the Englishman Wycliffe spread widely throughout
Europe.  In 1398 a learned Czech, John Huss, delivered a series of
lectures upon Wycliffe’s teachings in the university of Prague.  This
teaching spread rapidly beyond the educated class and aroused great
popular enthusiasm.  In 1414-18 a Council of the whole church was held
at Constance to settle the Great Schism.  Huss was invited to this
Council under promise of a safe conduct from the emperor, seized, put
on trial for heresy and burnt alive (1415).  So far from tranquillizing
the Bohemian people, this led to an insurrection of the Hussites in
that country, the first of a series of religious wars that inaugurated
the break-up of Latin Christendom.  Against this insurrection Pope
Martin V, the Pope specially elected at Constance as the head of a
reunited Christendom, preached a Crusade.

Five Crusades in all were launched upon this sturdy little people and
all of them failed.  All the unemployed ruffianism of Europe was turned
upon Bohemia in the fifteenth century, just as in the thirteenth it had
been turned upon the Waldenses.  But the Bohemian Czechs, unlike the
Waldenses, believed in armed resistance.  The Bohemian Crusade
dissolved and streamed away from the battlefield at the sound of the
Hussites’ waggons and the distant chanting of their troops; it did not
even wait to fight (battle of Domazlice, 1431).  In 1436 an agreement
was patched up with the Hussites by a new Council of the church at
Basle in which many of the special objections to Latin practice were
conceded.

In the fifteenth century a great pestilence had produced much social
disorganization throughout Europe.  There had been extreme misery and
discontent among the common people, and peasant risings against the
landlords and the wealthy in England and France.  After the Hussite
Wars these peasant insurrections increased in gravity in Germany and
took on a religious character.  Printing came in as an influence upon
this development.  By the middle of the fifteenth century there were
printers at work with movable type in Holland and the Rhineland.  The
art spread to Italy and England, where Caxton was printing in
Westminster in 1477.  The immediate consequence was a great increase
and distribution of Bibles, and greatly increased facilities for
widespread popular controversies.  The European world became a world of
readers, to an extent that had never happened to any community in the
past.  And this sudden irrigation of the general mind with clearer
ideas and more accessible information occurred just at a time when the
church was confused and divided and not in a position to defend itself
effectively, and when many princes were looking for means to weaken its
hold upon the vast wealth it claimed in their dominions.

In Germany the attack upon the church gathered round the personality of
an ex-monk, Martin Luther (1483-1546), who appeared in Wittenberg in
1517 offering disputations against various orthodox doctrines and
practices.  At first he disputed in Latin in the fashion of the
Schoolmen.  Then he took up the new weapon of the printed word and
scattered his views far and wide in German addressed to the ordinary
people.  An attempt was made to suppress him as Huss had been
suppressed, but the printing press had changed conditions and he had
too many open and secret friends among the German princes for this fate
to overtake him.

For now in this age of multiplying ideas and weakened faith there were
many rulers who saw their advantage in breaking the religious ties
between their people and Rome.  They sought to make themselves in
person the heads of a more nationalized religion.  England, Scotland,
Sweden, Norway, Denmark, North Germany and Bohemia, one after another,
separated themselves from the Roman Communion.  They have remained
separated ever since.

The various princes concerned cared very little for the moral and
intellectual freedom of their subjects.  They used the religious doubts
and insurgence of their peoples to strengthen them against Rome, but
they tried to keep a grip upon the popular movement as soon as that
rupture was achieved and a national church set up under the control of
the crown.  But there has always been a curious vitality in the
teaching of Jesus, a direct appeal to righteousness and a man’s
self-respect over every loyalty and every subordination, lay or
ecclesiastical.  None of these princely churches broke off without also
breaking off a number of fragmentary sects that would admit the
intervention of neither prince nor Pope between a man and his God.  In
England and Scotland, for example, there was a number of sects who now
held firmly to the Bible as their one guide in life and belief.  They
refused the disciplines of a state church.  In England these
dissentients were the Non- conformists, who played a very large part in
the polities of that country in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries.  In England they carried their objection to a princely head
to the church so far as to decapitate King Charles I (1649), and for
eleven prosperous years England was a republic under Non- conformist
rule.

The breaking away of this large section of Northern Europe from Latin
Christendom is what is generally spoken of as the Reformation.  But the
shock and stress of these losses produced changes perhaps as profound
in the Roman Church itself.  The church was reorganized and a new
spirit came into its life.  One of the dominant figures in this revival
was a young Spanish soldier, Inigo Lopez de Recalde, better known to
the world as St. Ignatius of Loyola.  After some romantic beginnings he
became a priest (1538) and was permitted to found the Society of Jesus,
a direct attempt to bring the generous and chivalrous traditions of
military discipline into the service of religion.  This Society of
Jesus, the Jesuits, became one of the greatest teaching and missionary
societies the world has ever seen.  It carried Christianity to India,
China and America.  It arrested the rapid disintegration of the Roman
Church.  It raised the standard of education throughout the whole
Catholic world; it raised the level of Catholic intelligence and
quickened the Catholic conscience everywhere; it stimulated Protestant
Europe to competitive educational efforts.  The vigorous and aggressive
Roman Catholic Church we know to-day is largely the product of this
Jesuit revival.




LI
THE EMPEROR CHARLES V


The Holy Roman Empire came to a sort of climax in the reign of the
Emperor Charles V. He was one of the most extraordinary monarchs that
Europe has ever seen. For a time he had the air of being the greatest
monarch since Charlemagne.

His greatness was not of his own making.  It was largely the creation
of his grandfather, the Emperor Maximilian I (1459- 1519).  Some
families have fought, others have intrigued their way to world power;
the Habsburgs married their way. Maximilian began his career with
Austria, Styria, part of Alsace and other districts, the original
Habsburg patrimony; he married—the lady’s name scarcely matters to
us—the Netherlands and Burgundy.  Most of Burgundy slipped from him
after his first wife’s death, but the Netherlands he held.  Then he
tried unsuccessfully to marry Brittany.  He became Emperor in
succession to his father, Frederick III, in 1493, and married the duchy
of Milan. Finally he married his son to the weak-minded daughter of
Ferdinand and Isabella, the Ferdinand and Isabella of Columbus, who not
only reigned over a freshly united Spain and over Sardinia and the
kingdom of the two Sicilies, but over all America west of Brazil.  So
it was that this Charles V, his grandson, inherited most of the
American continent and between a third and a half of what the Turks had
left of Europe.  He succeeded to the Netherlands in 1506.  When his
grandfather Ferdinand died in 1516, he became practically king of the
Spanish dominions, his mother being imbecile; and his grandfather
Maximilian dying in 1519, he was in 1520 elected Emperor at the still
comparatively tender age of twenty.

He was a fair young man with a not very intelligent face, a thick upper
lip and a long clumsy chin.  He found himself in a world of young and
vigorous personalities.  It was an age of brilliant young monarchs. 
Francis I had succeeded to the French throne in 1515 at the age of
twenty-one, Henry VIII had become King of England in 1509 at eighteen. 
It was the age of Baber in India (1526-1530) and Suleiman the
Magnificent in Turkey (1520), both exceptionally capable monarchs, and
the Pope Leo X (1513) was also a very distinguished Pope.  The Pope and
Francis I attempted to prevent the election of Charles as Emperor
because they dreaded the concentration of so much power in the hands of
one man.  Both Francis I and Henry VIII offered themselves to the
imperial electors.  But there was now a long established tradition of
Habsburg Emperors (since 1273), and some energetic bribery secured the
election for Charles.

At first the young man was very much a magnificent puppet in the hands
of his ministers.  Then slowly he began to assert himself and take
control.  He began to realize something of the threatening complexities
of his exalted position.  It was a position as unsound as it was
splendid.

From the very outset of his reign he was faced by the situation created
by Luther’s agitations in Germany. The Emperor had one reason for
siding with the reformers in the opposition of the Pope to his
election.  But he had been brought up in Spain, that most Catholic of
countries, and he decided against Luther.  So he came into conflict
with the Protestant princes and particularly the Elector of Saxony. He
found himself in the presence of an opening rift that was to split the
outworn fabric of Christendom into two contending camps.  His attempts
to close that rift were strenuous and honest and ineffective.  There
was an extensive peasant revolt in Germany which interwove with the
general political and religious disturbance.  And these internal
troubles were complicated by attacks upon the Empire from east and west
alike.  On the west of Charles was his spirited rival, Francis I; to
the east was the ever advancing Turk, who was now in Hungary, in
alliance with Francis and clamouring for certain arrears of tribute
from the Austrian dominions.  Charles had the money and army of Spain
at his disposal, but it was extremely difficult to get any effective
support in money from Germany.  His social and political troubles were
complicated by financial distresses.  He was forced to ruinous
borrowing.

On the whole, Charles, in alliance with Henry VIII, was successful
against Francis I and the Turk.  Their chief battlefield was North
Italy; the generalship was dull on both sides; their advances and
retreats depended mainly on the arrival of reinforcements.  The German
army invaded France, failed to take Marseilles, fell back into Italy,
lost Milan, and was besieged in Pavia.  Francis I made a long and
unsuccessful siege of Pavia, was caught by fresh German forces,
defeated, wounded and taken prisoner.  But thereupon the Pope and Henry
VIII, still haunted by the fear of his attaining excessive power,
turned against Charles.  The German troops in Milan, under the
Constable of Bourbon, being unpaid, forced rather than followed their
commander into a raid upon Rome.  They stormed the city and pillaged it
(1527).  The Pope took refuge in the Castle of St. Angelo while the
looting and slaughter went on.  He bought off the German troops at last
by the payment of four hundred thousand ducats.  Ten years of such
confused fighting impoverished all Europe.  At last the Emperor found
himself triumphant in Italy.  In 1530, he was crowned by the Pope—he
was the last German Emperor to be so crowned—at Bologna.

Meanwhile the Turks were making great headway in Hungary. They had
defeated and killed the king of Hungary in 1526, they held Buda-Pesth,
and in 1529 Suleiman the Magnificent very nearly took Vienna.  The
Emperor was greatly concerned by these advances, and did his utmost to
drive back the Turks, but he found the greatest difficulty in getting
the German princes to unite even with this formidable enemy upon their
very borders.  Francis I remained implacable for a time, and there was
a new French war; but in 1538 Charles won his rival over to a more
friendly attitude after ravaging the south of France.  Francis and
Charles then formed an alliance against the Turk.  But the Protestant
princes, the German princes who were resolved to break away from Rome,
had formed a league, the Schmalkaldic League, against the Emperor, and
in the place of a great campaign to recover Hungary for Christendom
Charles had to turn his mind to the gathering internal struggle in
Germany.  Of that struggle he saw only the opening war.  It was a
struggle, a sanguinary irrational bickering of princes, for ascendancy,
now flaming into war and destruction, now sinking back to intrigues and
diplomacies; it was a snake’s sack of princely policies that was to go
on writhing incurably right into the nineteenth century and to waste
and desolate Central Europe again and again.

The Emperor never seems to have grasped the true forces at work in
these gathering troubles.  He was for his time and station an
exceptionally worthy man, and he seems to have taken the religious
dissensions that were tearing Europe into warring fragments as genuine
theological differences.  He gathered diets and councils in futile
attempts at reconciliation.  Formulæ and confessions were tried over. 
The student of German history must struggle with the details of the
Religious Peace of Nuremberg, the settlement at the Diet of Ratisbon,
the Interim of Augsburg, and the like.  Here we do but mention them as
details in the worried life of this culminating Emperor.  As a matter
of fact, hardly one of the multifarious princes and rulers in Europe
seems to have been acting in good faith.  The widespread religious
trouble of the world, the desire of the common people for truth and
social righteousness, the spreading knowledge of the time, all those
things were merely counters in the imaginations of princely diplomacy. 
Henry VIII of England, who had begun his career with a book against
heresy, and who had been rewarded by the Pope with the title of
“Defender of the Faith,” being anxious to divorce his first wife in
favour of a young lady named Anne Boleyn, and wishing also to loot the
vast wealth of the church in England, joined the company of Protestant
princes in 1530. Sweden, Denmark and Norway had already gone over to
the Protestant side.

The German religious war began in 1546, a few months after the death of
Martin Luther.  We need not trouble about the incidents of the
campaign.  The Protestant Saxon army was badly beaten at Lochau.  By
something very like a breach of faith Philip of Hesse, the Emperor’s
chief remaining antagonist, was caught and imprisoned, and the Turks
were bought off by the promise of an annual tribute.  In 1547, to the
great relief of the Emperor, Francis I died.  So by 1547 Charles got to
a kind of settlement, and made his last efforts to effect peace where
there was no peace.  In 1552 all Germany was at war again, only a
precipitate flight from Innsbruck saved Charles from capture, and in
1552, with the treaty of Passau, came another unstable equilibrium ....

Such is the brief outline of the politics of the Empire for thirty-two
years.  It is interesting to note how entirely the European mind was
concentrated upon the struggle for European ascendancy.  Neither Turks,
French, English nor Germans had yet discovered any political interest
in the great continent of America, nor any significance in the new sea
routes to Asia.  Great things were happening in America; Cortez with a
mere handful of men had conquered the great Neolithic empire of Mexico
for Spain, Pizarro had crossed the Isthmus of Panama (1530) and
subjugated another wonder-land, Peru.  But as yet these events meant no
more to Europe than a useful and stimulating influx of silver to the
Spanish treasury.

It was after the treaty of Passau that Charles began to display his
distinctive originality of mind.  He was now entirely bored and
disillusioned by his imperial greatness. A sense of the intolerable
futility of these European rivalries came upon him.  He had never been
of a very sound constitution, he was naturally indolent and he was
suffering greatly from gout.  He abdicated.  He made over all his
sovereign rights in Germany to his brother Ferdinand, and Spain and the
Netherlands he resigned to his son Philip. Then in a sort of
magnificent dudgeon he retired to a monastery at Yuste, among the oak
and chestnut forests in the hills to the north of the Tagus valley. 
There he died in 1558.

Much has been written in a sentimental vein of this retirement, this
renunciation of the world by this tired majestic Titan, world-weary,
seeking in an austere solitude his peace with God.  But his retreat was
neither solitary nor austere; he had with him nearly a hundred and
fifty attendants: his establishment had all the splendour and
indulgences without the fatigues or a court, and Philip II was a
dutiful son to whom his father’s advice was a command.

And if Charles had lost his living interest in the administration of
European affairs, there were other motives of a more immediate sort to
stir him.  Says Prescott: “In the almost daily correspondence between
Quixada, or Gaztelu, and the Secretary of State at Valladolid, there is
scarcely a letter that does not turn more or less on the Emperor’s
eating or his illness.  The one seems naturally to follow, like a
running commentary, on the other.  It is rare that such topics have
formed the burden of communications with the department of state.  It
must have been no easy matter for the secretary to preserve his gravity
in the perusal of despatches in which politics and gastronomy were so
strangely mixed together.  The courier from Valladolid to Lisbon was
ordered to make a detour, so as to take Jarandilla in his route, and
bring supplies to the royal table.  On Thursdays he was to bring fish
to serve for the jour maigre that was to follow.  The trout in the
neighbourhood Charles thought too small, so others of a larger size
were to be sent from Valladolid.  Fish of every kind was to his taste,
as, indeed, was anything that in its nature or habits at all approached
to fish.  Eels, frogs, oysters, occupied an important place in the
royal bill of fare.  Potted fish, especially anchovies, found great
favour with him; and he regretted that he had not brought a better
supply of these from the Low Countries.  On an eel-pasty he
particularly doted.” ... [1]

In 1554 Charles had obtained a bull from Pope Julius III granting him a
dispensation from fasting, and allowing him to break his fast early in
the morning even when he was to take the sacrament.

Eating and doctoring! it was a return to elemental things. He had never
acquired the habit of reading, but he would be read aloud to at meals
after the fashion of Charlemagne, and would make what one narrator
describes as a “sweet and heavenly commentary.”  He also amused himself
with mechanical toys, by listening to music or sermons, and by
attending to the imperial business that still came drifting in to him. 
The death of the Empress, to whom he was greatly attached, had turned
his mind towards religion, which in his case took a punctilious and
ceremonial form; every Friday in Lent he scourged himself with the rest
of the monks with such good will as to draw blood.  These exercises and
the gout released a bigotry in Charles that had hitherto been
restrained by considerations of policy.  The appearance of Protestant
teaching close at hand in Valladolid roused him to fury.  “Tell the
grand inquisitor and his council from me to be at their posts, and to
lay the axe at the root of the evil before it spreads further.” . .. He
expressed a doubt whether it would not be well, in so black an affair,
to dispense with the ordinary course of justice, and to show no mercy;
“lest the criminal, if pardoned, should have the opportunity of
repeating his crime.”  He recommended, as an example, his own mode or
proceeding in the Netherlands, “where all who remained obstinate in
their errors were burned alive, and those who were admitted to
penitence were beheaded.”

And almost symbolical of his place and role in history was his
preoccupation with funerals.  He seems to have had an intuition that
something great was dead in Europe and sorely needed burial, that there
was a need to write Finis, overdue.  He not only attended every actual
funeral that was celebrated at Yuste, but he had services conducted for
the absent dead, he held a funeral service in memory of his wife on the
anniversary of her death, and finally he celebrated his own obsequies.

“The chapel was hung with black, and the blaze of hundreds of
wax-lights was scarcely sufficient to dispel the darkness.  The
brethren in their conventual dress, and all the Emperor’s household
clad in deep mourning, gathered round a huge catafalque, shrouded also
in black, which had been raised in the centre of the chapel.  The
service for the burial of the dead was then performed; and, amidst the
dismal wail of the monks, the prayers ascended for the departed spirit,
that it might be received into the mansions of the blessed.  The
sorrowful attendants were melted to tears, as the image of their
master’s death was presented to their minds—or they were touched, it
may be, with compassion by this pitiable display of weakness.  Charles,
muffled in a dark mantle, and bearing a lighted candle in his hand,
mingled with his household, the spectator of his own obsequies; and the
doleful ceremony was concluded by his placing the taper in the hands of
the priest, in sign of his surrendering up his soul to the Almighty.”

Within two months of this masquerade he was dead.  And the brief
greatness of the Holy Roman Empire died with him.  His realm was
already divided between his brother and his son. The Holy Roman Empire
struggled on indeed to the days of Napoleon I but as an invalid and
dying thing.  To this day its unburied tradition still poisons the
political air.

LII
THE AGE OF POLITICAL EXPERIMENTS; OF GRAND MONARCHY AND PARLIAMENTS AND
REPUBLICANISM IN EUROPE


The Latin Church was broken, the Holy Roman Empire was in extreme
decay; the history of Europe from the opening of the sixteenth century
onward is a story of peoples feeling their way darkly to some new
method of government, better adapted to the new conditions that were
arising. In the Ancient World, over long periods of time, there had
been changes of dynasty and even changes of ruling race and language,
but the form of government through monarch and temple remained fairly
stable, and still more stable was the ordinary way of living. In this
modern Europe since the sixteenth century the dynastic changes are
unimportant, and the interest of history lies in the wide and
increasing variety of experiments in political and social organization.

The political history of the world from the sixteenth century onward
was, we have said, an effort, a largely unconscious effort, of mankind
to adapt its political and social methods to certain new conditions
that had now arisen.  The effort to adapt was complicated by the fad
that the conditions themselves were changing with a steadily increasing
rapidity. The adaptation, mainly unconscious and almost always
unwilling (for man in general hates voluntary change), has lagged more
and more behind the alterations in conditions. From the sixteenth
century onward the history of mankind is a story of political and
social institutions becoming more and more plainly misfits, less
comfortable and more vexatious, and of the slow reluctant realization
of the need for a conscious and deliberate reconstruction of the whole
scheme of human societies in the face of needs and possibilities new to
all the former experiences of life.

What are these changes in the conditions of human life that have
disorganized that balance of empire, priest, peasant and trader, with
periodic refreshment by barbaric conquest, that has held human affairs
in the Old World in a sort of working rhythm for more than a hundred
centuries?

They are manifold and various, for human affairs are multitudinously
complex; but the main changes seem all to turn upon one cause, namely
the growth and extension of a knowledge of the nature of things,
beginning first of all in small groups of intelligent people and
spreading at first slowly, and in the last five hundred years very
rapidly, to larger and larger proportions of the general population.

But there has also been a great change in human conditions due to a
change in the spirit of human life.  This change has gone on side by
side with the increase and extension of knowledge, and is subtly
connected with it.  There has been an increasing disposition to treat a
life based on the common and more elementary desires and gratifications
as unsatisfactory, and to seek relationship with and service and
participation in a larger life.  This is the common characteristic of
all the great religions that have spread throughout the world in the
last twenty odd centuries, Buddhism, Christianity and Islam alike. 
They have had to do with the spirit of man in a way that the older
religions did not have to do.  They are forces quite different in their
nature and effect from the old fetishistic blood-sacrifice religions of
priest and temple that they have in part modified and in part replaced.
 They have gradually evolved a self-respect in the individual and a
sense of participation and responsibility in the common concerns of
mankind that did not exist among the populations of the earlier
civilizations.

The first considerable change in the conditions of political and social
life was the simplification and extended use of writing in the ancient
civilizations which made larger empires and wider political
understandings practicable and inevitable.  The next movement forward
came with the introduction of the horse, and later on of the camel as a
means of transport, the use of wheeled vehicles, the extension of roads
and the increased military efficiency due to the discovery of
terrestrial iron.  Then followed the profound economic disturbances due
to the device of coined money and the change in the nature of debt,
proprietorship and trade due to this convenient but dangerous
convention. The empires grew in size and range, and men’s ideas grew
likewise to correspond with these things.  Came the disappearance of
local gods, the age of theocrasia, and the teaching of the great world
religions.  Came also the beginnings of reasoned and recorded history
and geography, the first realization by man of his profound ignorance,
and the first systematic search for knowledge.

For a time the scientific process which began so brilliantly in Greece
and Alexandria was interrupted.  The raids of the Teutonic barbarians,
the westward drive of the Mongolian peoples, convulsive religious
reconstruction and great pestilences put enormous strains upon
political and social order.  When civilization emerged again from this
phase of conflict and confusion, slavery was no longer the basis of
economic life; and the first paper-mills were preparing a new medium
for collective information and co-operation in printed matter. 
Gradually at this point and that, the search for knowledge, the
systematic scientific process, was resumed.

And now from the sixteenth century onward, as an inevitable by-product
of systematic thought, appeared a steadily increasing series of
inventions and devices affecting the intercommunication and interaction
of men with one another. They all tended towards wider range of action,
greater mutual benefits or injuries, and increased co-operation, and
they came faster and faster.  Men’s minds had not been prepared for
anything of the sort, and until the great catastrophes at the beginning
of the twentieth century quickened men’s minds, the historian has very
little to tell of any intelligently planned attempts to meet the new
conditions this increasing flow of inventions was creating. The history
of mankind for the last four centuries is rather like that of an
imprisoned sleeper, stirring clumsily and uneasily while the prison
that restrains and shelters him catches fire, not waking but
incorporating the crackling and warmth of the fire with ancient and
incongruous dreams, than like that of a man consciously awake to danger
and opportunity.

Since history is the story not of individual lives but of communities,
it is inevitable that the inventions that figure most in the historical
record are inventions affecting communications.  In the sixteenth
century the chief new things that we have to note are the appearance of
printed paper and the sea-worthy, ocean-going sailing ship using the
new device of the mariner’s compass.  The former cheapened, spread, and
revolutionized teaching, public information and discussion, and the
fundamental operations of political activity.  The latter made the
round world one.  But almost equally important was the increased
utilization and improvement of guns and gunpowder which the Mongols had
first brought westward in the thirteenth century.  This destroyed the
practical immunity of barons in their castles and of walled cities. 
Guns swept away feudalism.  Constantinople fell to guns. Mexico and
Peru fell before the terror of the Spanish guns.


CROMWELL DISSOLVES THE LONG PARLIAMENT AND SO BECOMES AUTOCRAT OF THE
ENGLISH REPUBLIC
CROMWELL DISSOLVES THE LONG PARLIAMENT AND SO BECOMES AUTOCRAT OF THE
ENGLISH REPUBLIC

_(From a contemporary satirical print in the British Museum)_


The seventeenth century saw the development of systematic scientific
publication, a less conspicuous but ultimately far more pregnant
innovation.  Conspicuous among the leaders in this great forward step
was Sir Francis Bacon (1561-1626) afterwards Lord Verulam, Lord
Chancellor of England.  He was the pupil and perhaps the mouthpiece of
another Englishman; Dr. Gilbert, the experimental philosopher of
Colchester (1540-1603).  This second Bacon, like the first, preached
observation and experiment, and he used the inspiring and fruitful form
of a Utopian story, _The New Atlantis_, to express his dream of a great
service of scientific research.

Presently arose the Royal Society of London, the Florentine Society,
and later other national bodies for the encouragement of research and
the publication and exchange of knowledge.  These European scientific
societies became fountains not only of countless inventions but also of
a destructive criticism of the grotesque theological history of the
world that had dominated and crippled human thought for many centuries.

Neither the seventeenth nor the eighteenth century witnessed any
innovations so immediately revolutionary in human conditions as printed
paper and the ocean-going ship, but there was a steady accumulation of
knowledge and scientific energy that was to bear its full fruits in the
nineteenth century.  The exploration and mapping of the world went on.
Tasmania, Australia, New Zealand appeared on the map.  In Great Britain
in the eighteenth century coal coke began to be used for metallurgical
purposes, leading to a considerable cheapening of iron and to the
possibility of casting and using it in larger pieces than had been
possible before, when it had been smelted with wood charcoal.  Modern
machinery dawned.

Like the trees of the celestial city, science bears bud and flower and
fruit at the same time and continuously.  With the onset of the
nineteenth century the real fruition of science—which indeed henceforth
may never cease—began.  First came steam and steel, the railway, the
great liner, vast bridges and buildings, machinery of almost limitless
power, the possibility of a bountiful satisfaction of every material
human need, and then, still more wonderful, the hidden treasures of
electrical science were opened to men ....

We have compared the political and social life of man from the
sixteenth century onward to that of a sleeping prisoner who lies and
dreams while his prison burns about him.  In the sixteenth century the
European mind was still going on with its Latin Imperial dream, its
dream of a Holy Roman Empire, united under a Catholic Church.  But just
as some uncontrollable element in our composition will insist at times
upon introducing into our dreams the most absurd and destructive
comments, so thrust into this dream we find the sleeping face and
craving stomach of the Emperor Charles V, while Henry VIII of England
and Luther tear the unity of Catholicism to shreds.


THE COURT AT VERSAILLES
THE COURT AT VERSAILLES

_(From the print after Watteau in the British Museum)_


In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the dream turned to
personal monarchy.  The history of nearly all Europe during this period
tells with variations the story of an attempt to consolidate a
monarchy, to make it absolute and to extend its power over weaker
adjacent regions, and of the steady resistance, first of the landowners
and then with the increase of foreign trade and home industry, of the
growing trading and moneyed class, to the exaction and interference of
the crown.  There is no universal victory of either side; here it is
the King who gets the upper hand while there it is the man of private
property who beats the King.  In one case we find a King becoming the
sun and centre of his national world, while just over his borders a
sturdy mercantile class maintains a republic.  So wide a range of
variation shows how entirely experimental, what local accidents, were
all the various governments of this period.

A very common figure in these national dramas is the King’s minister,
often in the still Catholic countries a prelate, who stands behind the
King, serves him and dominates him by his indispensable services.

Here in the limits set to us it is impossible to tell these various
national dramas in detail.  The trading folk of Holland went Protestant
and republican, and cast off the rule of Philip II of Spain, the son of
the Emperor Charles V.  In England Henry VIII and his minister Wolsey,
Queen Elizabeth and her minister Burleigh, prepared the foundations of
an absolutism that was wrecked by the folly of James I and Charles I. 
Charles I was beheaded for treason to his people (1649), a new turn in
the political thought of Europe.  For a dozen years (until 1660)
Britain was a republic; and the crown was an unstable power, much
overshadowed by Parliament, until George III (1760-1820) made a
strenuous and partly successful effort to restore its predominance. 
The King of France, on the other hand, was the most successful of all
the European Kings in perfecting monarchy.  Two great ministers,
Richelieu (1585-1642) and Mazarin (1602-1661), built up the power of
the crown in that country, and the process was aided by the long reign
and very considerable abilities of King Louis XIV, “the Grand Monarque”
(1643-1715).

Louis XIV was indeed the pattern King of Europe.  He was, within his
limitations, an exceptionally capable King; his ambition was stronger
than his baser passions, and he guided his country towards bankruptcy
through the complication of a spirited foreign policy with an elaborate
dignity that still extorts our admiration.  His immediate desire was to
consolidate and extend France to the Rhine and Pyrenees, and to absorb
the Spanish Netherlands; his remoter view saw the French Kings as the
possible successors of Charlemagne in a recast Holy Roman Empire.  He
made bribery a state method almost more important than warfare. 
Charles II of England was in his pay, and so were most of the Polish
nobility, presently to be described.  His money, or rather the money of
the tax- paying classes in France, went everywhere.  But his prevailing
occupation was splendour.  His great palace at Versailles with its
salons, its corridors, its mirrors, its terraces and fountains and
parks and prospects, was the envy and admiration of the world.


THE SACK OF A VILLAGE DURING THE FRENCH REVOLUTION
THE SACK OF A VILLAGE DURING THE FRENCH REVOLUTION

_(From Callot’s “Miseres de la Guerre”) _


He provoked a universal imitation.  Every king and princelet in Europe
was building his own Versailles as much beyond his means as his
subjects and credits would permit.  Everywhere the nobility rebuilt or
extended their chateaux to the new pattern.  A great industry of
beautiful and elaborate fabrics and furnishings developed.  The
luxurious arts flourished everywhere; sculpture in alabaster, faience,
gilt woodwork, metal work, stamped leather, much music, magnificent
painting, beautiful printing and bindings, fine crockery, fine
vintages.  Amidst the mirrors and fine furniture went a strange race of
“gentlemen” in tall powdered wigs, silks and laces, poised upon high
red heels, supported by amazing canes; and still more wonderful
“ladies,” under towers of powdered hair and wearing vast expansions of
silk and satin sustained on wire. Through it all postured the great
Louis, the sun of his world, unaware of the meagre and sulky and bitter
faces that watched him from those lower darknesses to which his
sunshine did not penetrate.


Map: Central Europe after the Peace of Westphalia, 1648

The German people remained politically divided throughout this period
of the monarchies and experimental governments, and a considerable
number of ducal and princely courts aped the splendours of Versailles
on varying scales. The Thirty Years’ War (1618-48), a devastating
scramble among the Germans, Swedes and Bohemians for fluctuating
political advantages, sapped the energies of Germany for a century.  A
map must show the crazy patchwork in which this struggle ended, a map
of Europe according to the peace of Westphalia (1648).  One sees a
tangle of principalities, dukedoms, free states and the like, some
partly in and partly out of the Empire.  Sweden’s arm, the reader will
note, reached far into Germany; and except for a few islands of
territory within the imperial boundaries France was still far from the
Rhine.  Amidst this patchwork the Kingdom of Prussia—it became a
Kingdom in 1701—rose steadily to prominence and sustained a series of
successful wars. Frederick the Great of Prussia (1740-86) had his
Versailles at Potsdam, where his court spoke French, read French
literature and rivalled the culture of the French King.

In 1714 the Elector of Hanover became King of England, adding one more
to the list of monarchies half in and half out of the empire.

The Austrian branch of the descendants of Charles V retained the title
of Emperor; the Spanish branch retained Spain.  But now there was also
an Emperor of the East again.  After the fall of Constantinople (1453),
the grand duke of Moscow, Ivan the Great (1462-1505), claimed to be
heir to the Byzantine throne and adopted the Byzantine double-headed
eagle upon his arms.  His grandson, Ivan IV, Ivan the Terrible
(1533-1584), assumed the imperial title of Cæsar (Tsar).  But only in
the latter half of the seventeenth century did Russia cease to seem
remote and Asiatic to the European mind.  The Tsar Peter the Great
(1682-1725) brought Russia into the arena of Western affairs.  He built
a new capital for his empire, Petersburg upon the Neva, that played the
part of a window between Russia and Europe, and he set up his
Versailles at Peterhof eighteen miles away, employing a French
architect who gave him a terrace, fountains, cascades, picture gallery,
park and all the recognized appointments of Grand Monarchy. In Russia
as in Prussia French became the language of the court.

Unhappily placed between Austria, Prussia and Russia was the Polish
kingdom, an ill-organized state of great landed proprietors too jealous
of their own individual grandeur to permit more than a nominal kingship
to the monarch they elected.  Her fate was division among these three
neighbours, in spite of the efforts of France to retain her as an
independent ally.  Switzerland at this time was a group of republican
cantons; Venice was a republic; Italy like so much of Germany was
divided among minor dukes and princes.  The Pope ruled like a prince in
the papal states, too fearful now of losing the allegiance of the
remaining Catholic princes to interfere between them and their subjects
or to remind the world of the commonweal of Christendom. There remained
indeed no common political idea in Europe at all; Europe was given over
altogether to division and diversity.

All these sovereign princes and republics carried on schemes of
aggrandizement against each other.  Each one of them pursued a “foreign
policy” of aggression against its neighbours and of aggressive
alliances.  We Europeans still live to-day in the last phase of this
age of the multifarious sovereign states, and still suffer from the
hatreds, hostilities and suspicions it engendered.  The history of this
time becomes more and more manifestly “gossip,” more and more unmeaning
and wearisome to a modern intelligence.  You are told of how this war
was caused by this King’s mistress, and how the jealousy of one
minister for another caused that.  A tittle-tattle of bribes and
rivalries disgusts the intelligent student.  The more permanently
significant fact is that in spite of the obstruction of a score of
frontiers, reading and thought still spread and increased and
inventions multiplied.  The eighteenth century saw the appearance of a
literature profoundly sceptical and critical of the courts and policies
of the time.  In such a book as Voltaire’s _Candide_ we have the
expression of an infinite weariness with the planless confusion of the
European world.




LIII
THE NEW EMPIRES OF THE EUROPEANS IN ASIA AND OVERSEAS


While Central Europe thus remained divided and confused, the Western
Europeans and particularly the Dutch, the Scandinavians, the Spanish,
the Portuguese, the French and the British were extending the area of
their struggles across the seas of all the world. The printing press
had dissolved the political ideas of Europe into a vast and at first
indeterminate fermentation, but that other great innovation, the
ocean-going sailing ship, was inexorably extending the range of
European experience to the furthermost limits of salt water.

The first overseas settlements of the Dutch and Northern Atlantic
Europeans were not for colonization but for trade and mining.  The
Spaniards were first in the field; they claimed dominion over the whole
of this new world of America. Very soon however the Portuguese asked
for a share.  The Pope—it was one of the last acts of Rome as mistress
of the world—divided the new continent between these two first-comers,
giving Portugal Brazil and everything else east of a line 370 leagues
west of the Cape Verde islands, and all the rest to Spain (1494).  The
Portuguese at this time were also pushing overseas enterprise southward
and eastward.  In 1497 Vasco da Gama had sailed from Lisbon round the
Cape to Zanzibar and then to Calicut in India.  In 1515 there were
Portuguese ships in Java and the Moluccas, and the Portuguese were
setting up and fortifying trading stations round and about the coasts
of the Indian Ocean.  Mozambique, Goa, and two smaller possessions in
India, Macao in China and a part of Timor are to this day Portuguese
possessions.

The nations excluded from America by the papal settlement paid little
heed to the rights of Spain and Portugal.  The English, the Danes and
Swedes, and presently the Dutch, were soon staking out claims in North
America and the West Indies, and his Most Catholic Majesty of France
heeded the papal settlement as little as any Protestant.  The wars of
Europe extended themselves to these claims and possessions.


Map: Central Europe after the Peace of Westphalia, 1648

In the long run the English were the most successful in this scramble
for overseas possessions. The Danes and Swedes were too deeply
entangled in the complicated affairs of Germany to sustain effective
expeditions abroad.  Sweden was wasted upon the German battlefields by
a picturesque king, Gustavus Adolphus, the Protestant “Lion of the
North.”  The Dutch were the heirs of such small settlements as Sweden
made in America, and the Dutch were too near French aggressions to hold
their own against the British.  In the far East the chief rivals for
empire were the British, Dutch and French, and in America the British,
French and Spanish.  The British had the supreme advantage of a water
frontier, the “silver streak” of the English Channel, against Europe. 
The tradition of the Latin Empire entangled them least.

France has always thought too much in terms of Europe. Throughout the
eighteenth century she was wasting her opportunities of expansion in
West and East alike in order to dominate Spain, Italy and the German
confusion.  The religious and political dissensions of Britain in the
seventeenth century had driven many of the English to seek a permanent
home in America.  They struck root and increased and multiplied, giving
the British a great advantage in the American struggle.  In 1756 and
1760 the French lost Canada to the British and their American
colonists, and a few years later the British trading company found
itself completely dominant over French, Dutch and Portuguese in the
peninsula of India.  The great Mongol Empire of Baber, Akbar and their
successors had now far gone in decay, and the story of its practical
capture by a London trading company, the British East India Company, is
one of the most extraordinary episodes in the whole history of
conquest.


THE LAST EFFORT AND FALL OF TIPPOO SULTAN
THE LAST EFFORT AND FALL OF TIPPOO SULTAN

_(From the engraving of the picture by Singleton in the British
Museum)_


This East India Company had been originally at the time of its
incorporation under Queen Elizabeth no more than a company of sea
adventurers.  Step by step they had been forced to raise troops and arm
their ships.  And now this trading company, with its tradition of gain,
found itself dealing not merely in spices and dyes and tea and jewels,
but in the revenues and territories of princes and the destinies of
India.  It had come to buy and sell, and it found itself achieving a
tremendous piracy.  There was no one to challenge its proceedings.  Is
it any wonder that its captains and commanders and officials, nay, even
its clerks and common soldiers, came back to England loaded with
spoils?

Men under such circumstances, with a great and wealthy land at their
mercy, could not determine what they might or might not do.  It was a
strange land to them, with a strange sunlight; its brown people seemed
a different race, outside their range of sympathy; its mysterious
temples sustained fantastic standards of behaviour.  Englishmen at home
were perplexed when presently these generals and officials came back to
make dark accusations against each other of extortions and cruelties. 
Upon Clive Parliament passed a vote of censure.  He committed suicide
in 1774.  In 1788 Warren Hastings, a second great Indian administrator,
was impeached and acquitted (1792).  It was a strange and unprecedented
situation in the world’s history.  The English Parliament found itself
ruling over a London trading company, which in its turn was dominating
an empire far greater and more populous than all the domains of the
British crown.  To the bulk of the English people India was a remote,
fantastic, almost inaccessible land, to which adventurous poor young
men went out, to return after many years very rich and very choleric
old gentlemen.  It was difficult for the English to conceive what the
life of these countless brown millions in the eastern sunshine could
be.  Their imaginations declined the task.  India remained romantically
unreal.  It was impossible for the English, therefore, to exert any
effective supervision and control over the company’s proceedings.

And while the Western European powers were thus fighting for these
fantastic overseas empires upon every ocean in the world, two great
land conquests were in progress in Asia. China had thrown off the
Mongol yoke in 1360, and flourished under the great native dynasty of
the Mings until 1644.  Then the Manchus, another Mongol people,
reconquered China and remained masters of China until 1912.  Meanwhile
Russia was pushing East and growing to greatness in the world’s
affairs.  The rise of this great central power of the old world, which
is neither altogether of the East nor altogether of the West, is one of
the utmost importance to our human destiny.  Its expansion is very
largely due to the appearance of a Christian steppe people, the
Cossacks, who formed a barrier between the feudal agriculture of Poland
and Hungary to the west and the Tartar to the east.  The Cossacks were
the wild east of Europe, and in many ways not unlike the wild west of
the United States in the middle nineteenth century. All who had made
Russia too hot to hold them, criminals as well as the persecuted
innocent, rebellious serfs, religious secretaries, thieves, vagabonds,
murderers, sought asylum in the southern steppes and there made a fresh
start and fought for life and freedom against Pole, Russian and Tartar
alike. Doubtless fugitives from the Tartars to the east also
contributed to the Cossack mixture.  Slowly these border folk were
incorporated in the Russian imperial service, much as the highland
clans of Scotland were converted into regiments by the British
government.  New lands were offered them in Asia.  They became a weapon
against the dwindling power of the Mongolian nomads, first in Turkestan
and then across Siberia as far as the Amur.

The decay of Mongol energy in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
is very difficult to explain.  Within two or three centuries from the
days of Jengis and Timurlane Central Asia had relapsed from a period of
world ascendancy to extreme political impotence.  Changes of climate,
unrecorded pestilences, infections of a malarial type, may have played
their part in this recession—which may be only a temporary recession
measured by the scale of universal history—of the Central Asian
peoples.  Some authorities think that the spread of Buddhist teaching
from China also had a pacifying influence upon them.  At any rate, by
the sixteenth century the Mongol, Tartar and Turkish peoples were no
longer pressing outward, but were being invaded, subjugated and pushed
back both by Christian Russia in the west and by China in the east.

All through the seventeenth century the Cossacks were spreading
eastward from European Russia, and settling wherever they found
agricultural conditions.  Cordons of forts and stations formed a moving
frontier to these settlements to the south, where the Turkomans were
still strong and active; to the north-east, however, Russia had no
frontier until she reached right to the Pacific....




LIV
THE AMERICAN WAR OF INDEPENDENCE


The third quarter of the eighteenth century thus saw the remarkable and
unstable spectacle of a Europe divided against itself, and no longer
with any unifying political or religious idea, yet through the immense
stimulation of men’s imaginations by the printed book, the printed map,
and the opportunity of the new ocean-going shipping, able in a
disorganized and contentious manner to dominate all the coasts of the
world. It was a planless, incoherent ebullition of enterprise due to
temporary and almost accidental advantages over the rest of mankind. By
virtue of these advantages this new and still largely empty continent
of America was peopled mainly from Western European sources, and South
Africa and Australia and New Zealand marked down as prospective homes
for a European population.

The motive that had sent Columbus to America and Vasco da Gama to India
was the perennial first motive of all sailors since the beginning of
things—trade.  But while in the already populous and productive East
the trade motive remained dominant, and the European settlements
remained trading settlements from which the European inhabitants hoped
to return home to spend their money, the Europeans in America, dealing
with communities at a very much lower level of productive activity,
found a new inducement for persistence in the search for gold and
silver.  Particularly did the mines of Spanish America yield silver. 
The Europeans had to go to America not simply as armed merchants but as
prospectors, miners, searchers after natural products, and presently as
planters.  In the north they sought furs.  Mines and plantations
necessitated settlements.  They obliged people to set up permanent
overseas homes.  Finally in some cases, as when the English Puritans
went to New England in the early seventeenth 336}century to escape
religious persecution, when in the eighteenth Oglethorpe sent people
from the English debtors’ prisons to Georgia, and when in the end of
the eighteenth the Dutch sent orphans to the Cape of Good Hope, the
Europeans frankly crossed the seas to find new homes for good.  In the
nineteenth century, and especially after the coming of the steamship,
the stream of European emigration to the new empty lands of America and
Australia rose for some decades to the scale of a great migration.

So there grew up permanent overseas populations of Europeans, and the
European culture was transplanted to much larger areas than those in
which it had been developed.  These new communities bringing a
ready-made civilization with them to these new lands grew up, as it
were, unplanned and unperceived; the statecraft of Europe did not
foresee them, and was unprepared with any ideas about their treatment. 
The politicians and ministers of Europe continued to regard them as
essentially expeditionary establishments, sources of revenue,
“possessions” and “dependencies,” long after their peoples had
developed a keen sense of their separate social life.  And also they
continued to treat them as helplessly subject to the mother country
long after the population had spread inland out of reach of any
effectual punitive operations from the sea.

Because until right into the nineteenth century, it must be remembered,
the link of all these overseas empires was the oceangoing sailing ship.
 On land the swiftest thing was still the horse, and the cohesion and
unity of political systems on land was still limited by the limitations
of horse communications.

Now at the end of the third quarter of the eighteenth century the
northern two-thirds of North America was under the British crown. 
France had abandoned America.  Except for Brazil, which was Portuguese,
and one or two small islands and areas in French, British, Danish and
Dutch hands, Florida, Louisiana, California and all America to the
south was Spanish.  It was the British colonies south of Maine and Lake
Ontario that first demonstrated the inadequacy of the sailing ship to
hold overseas populations together in one political system.

These British colonies were very miscellaneous in their origin and
character.  There were French, Swedish and Dutch settlements as well as
British; there were British Catholics in Maryland and British
ultra-Protestants in New England, and while the New Englanders farmed
their own land and denounced slavery, the British in Virginia and the
south were planters employing a swelling multitude of imported negro
slaves.  There was no natural common unity in such states.  To get from
one to the other might mean a coasting voyage hardly less tedious than
the transatlantic crossing.  But the union that diverse origin and
natural conditions denied the British Americans was forced upon them by
the selfishness and stupidity of the British government in London. 
They were taxed without any voice in the spending of the taxes; their
trade was sacrificed to British interests; the highly profitable slave
trade was maintained by the British government in spite of the
opposition of the Virginians who—though quite willing to hold and use
slaves—feared to be swamped by an ever-growing barbaric black
population.

Britain at that time was lapsing towards an intenser form of monarchy,
and the obstinate personality of George III (1760- 1820) did much to
force on a struggle between the home and the colonial governments.

The conflict was precipitated by legislation which favoured the London
East India Company at the expense of the American shipper.  Three
cargoes of tea which were imported under the new conditions were thrown
overboard in Boston harbour by a band of men disguised as Indians
(1773).  Fighting only began in 1775 when the British government
attempted to arrest two of the American leaders at Lexington near
Boston.  The first shots were fired in Lexington by the British; the
first fighting occurred at Concord.

So the American War of Independence began, though for more than a year
the colonists showed themselves extremely unwilling to sever their
links with the mother land.  It was not until the middle of 1776 that
the Congress of the insurgent states issued “The Declaration of
Independence.”  George Washington, who like many of the leading
colonists of the time had had a military training in the wars against
the French, was made commander-in-chief.  In 1777 a British general,
General Burgoyne, in an attempt to reach New York from Canada, was
defeated at Freemans Farm and obliged to surrender at Saratoga.  In the
same year the French and Spanish declared war upon Great Britain,
greatly hampering her sea communications.  A second British army under
General Cornwallis was caught in the Yorktown peninsula in Virginia and
obliged to capitulate in 1781.  In 1783 peace was made in Paris, and
the Thirteen Colonies from Maine to Georgia became a union of
independent sovereign States.  So the United States of America came
into existence.  Canada remained loyal to the British flag.

For four years these States had only a very feeble central government
under certain Articles of Confederation, and they seemed destined to
break up into separate independent communities.  Their immediate
separation was delayed by the hostility of the British and a certain
aggressiveness on the part of the French which brought home to them the
immediate dangers of division.  A Constitution was drawn up and
ratified in 1788 establishing a more efficient Federal government with
a President holding very considerable powers, and the weak sense of
national unity was invigorated by a second war with Britain in 1812. 
Nevertheless the area covered by the States was so wide and their
interests so diverse at that time, that—given only the means of
communication then available—a disintegration of the Union into
separate states on the European scale of size was merely a question of
time.  Attendance at Washington meant a long, tedious and insecure
journey for the senators and congressmen of the remoter districts, and
the mechanical impediments to the diffusion of a common education and a
common literature and intelligence were practically insurmountable. 
Forces were at work in the world however that were to arrest the
process of differentiation altogether.  Presently came the river
steamboat and then the railway and the telegraph to save the United
States from fragmentation, and weave its dispersed people together
again into the first of great modern nations.

Twenty-two years later the Spanish colonies in America were to follow
the example of the Thirteen and break their connection with Europe. 
But being more dispersed over the continent and separated by great
mountainous chains and deserts and forests and by the Portuguese Empire
of Brazil, they did not achieve a union among themselves.  They became
a constellation of republican states, very prone at first to wars among
themselves and to revolutions.

Brazil followed a rather different line towards the inevitable
separation.  In 1807 the French armies under Napoleon had occupied the
mother country of Portugal, and the monarchy had fled to Brazil.  From
that time on until they separated, Portugal was rather a dependency of
Brazil than Brazil of Portugal.  In 1822 Brazil declared itself a
separate Empire under Pedro I, a son of the Portuguese King. But the
new world has never been very favourable to monarchy. In 1889 the
Emperor of Brazil was shipped off quietly to Europe, and the United
States of Brazil fell into line with the rest of republican America.




LV
THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND THE RESTORATION OF MONARCHY IN FRANCE


Britain had hardly lost the Thirteen Colonies in America before a
profound social and political convulsion at the very heart of Grand
Monarchy was to remind Europe still more vividly of the essentially
temporary nature of the political arrangements of the world.

We have said that the French monarchy was the most successful of the
personal monarchies in Europe.  It was the envy and model of a
multitude of competing and minor courts.  But it flourished on a basis
of injustice that led to its dramatic collapse.  It was brilliant and
aggressive, but it was wasteful of the life and substance of its common
people.  The clergy and nobility were protected from taxation by a
system of exemption that threw the whole burden of the state upon the
middle and lower classes.  The peasants were ground down by taxation;
the middle classes were dominated and humiliated by the nobility.

In 1787 this French monarchy found itself bankrupt and obliged to call
representatives of the different classes of the realm into consultation
upon the perplexities of defective income and excessive expenditure. 
In 1789 the States General, a gathering of the nobles, clergy and
commons, roughly equivalent to the earlier form of the British
Parliament, was called together at Versailles.  It had not assembled
since 1610.  For all that time France had been an absolute monarchy. 
Now the people found a means of expressing their long fermenting
discontent.  Disputes immediately broke out between the three estates,
due to the resolve of the Third Estate, the Commons, to control the
Assembly.  The Commons got the better of these disputes and the States
General became a National Assembly, clearly resolved to keep the crown
in order, as the British Parliament kept the British crown in order. 
The king (Louis XVI) prepared for a struggle and brought up troops from
the provinces.  Whereupon Paris and France revolted.

The collapse of the absolute monarchy was very swift.  The grim-looking
prison of the Bastille was stormed by the people of Paris, and the
insurrection spread rapidly throughout France.  In the east and
north-west provinces many chateaux belonging to the nobility were burnt
by the peasants, their title-deeds carefully destroyed, and the owners
murdered or driven away.  In a month the ancient and decayed system of
the aristocratic order had collapsed.  Many of the leading princes and
courtiers of the queen’s party fled abroad. A provisional city
government was set up in Paris and in most of the other large cities,
and a new armed force, the National Guard, a force designed primarily
and plainly to resist the forces of the crown, was brought into
existence by these municipal bodies.  The National Assembly found
itself called upon to create a new political and social system for a
new age.

It was a task that tried the powers of that gathering to the utmost. 
It made a great sweep of the chief injustices of the absolutist regime;
it abolished tax exemptions, serfdom, aristocratic titles and
privileges and sought to establish a constitutional monarchy in Paris. 
The king abandoned Versailles and its splendours and kept a diminished
state in the palace of the Tuileries in Paris.

For two years it seemed that the National Assembly might struggle
through to an effective modernized government.  Much of its work was
sound and still endures, if much was experimental and had to be undone.
 Much was ineffective. There was a clearing up of the penal code;
torture, arbitrary imprisonment and persecutions for heresy were
abolished.  The ancient provinces of France, Normandy, Burgundy and the
like gave place to eighty departments.  Promotion to the highest ranks
in the army was laid open to men of every class.  An excellent and
simple system of law courts was set up, but its value was much vitiated
by having the judges appointed by popular election for short periods of
time.  This made the crowd a sort of final court of appeal, and the
judges, like the members of the Assembly, were forced to play to the
gallery.  And the whole vast property of the church was seized and
administered by the state; religious establishments not engaged in
education or works of charity were broken up, and the salaries of the
clergy made a charge upon the nation.  This in itself was not a bad
thing for the lower clergy in France, who were often scandalously
underpaid in comparison with the richer dignitaries.  But in addition
the choice of priests and bishops was made elective, which struck at
the very root idea of the Roman Church, which centred everything upon
the Pope, and in which all authority is from above downward. 
Practically the National Assembly wanted at one blow to make the church
in France Protestant, in organization if not in doctrine.  Everywhere
there were disputes and conflicts between the state priests created by
the National Assembly and the recalcitrant (non-juring) priests who
were loyal to Rome.

In 1791 the experiment of Constitutional monarchy in France was brought
to an abrupt end by the action of the king and queen, working in
concert with their aristocratic and monarchist friends abroad.  Foreign
armies gathered on the Eastern frontier and one night in June the king
and queen and their children slipped away from the Tuileries and fled
to join the foreigners and the aristocratic exiles.  They were caught
at Varennes and brought back to Paris, and an France flamed up into a
passion of patriotic republicanism.  A Republic was proclaimed, open
war with Austria and Prussia ensued, and the king was tried and
executed (January, 1793) on the model already set by England, for
treason to his people.

And now followed a strange phase in the history of the French people. 
There arose a great flame of enthusiasm for France and the Republic. 
There was to be an end to compromise at home and abroad; at home
royalists and every form of disloyalty were to be stamped out; abroad
France was to be the protector and helper of all revolutionaries.  All
Europe, all the world, was to become Republican.  The youth of France
poured into the Republican armies; a new and wonderful song spread
through the land, a song that still warms the blood like wine, the
Marseillaise.  Before that chant and the leaping columns of French
bayonets and their enthusiastically served guns the foreign armies
rolled back; before the end of 1792 the French armies had gone far
beyond the utmost achievements of Louis XIV; everywhere they stood on
foreign soil. They were in Brussels, they had overrun Savoy, they had
raided to Mayence; they had seized the Scheldt from Holland. Then the
French Government did an unwise thing.  It had been exasperated by the
expulsion of its representative from England upon the execution of
Louis, and it declared war against England.  It was an unwise thing to
do, because the revolution which had given France a new enthusiastic
infantry and a brilliant artillery released from its aristocratic
officers and many cramping conditions had destroyed the discipline of
the navy, and the English were supreme upon the sea.  And this
provocation united all England against France, whereas there had been
at first a very considerable liberal movement in Great Britain in
sympathy with the revolution.


THE TRIAL OF LOUIS XVI
THE TRIAL OF LOUIS XVI

_(From a print in the British Museum)_


Of the fight that France made in the next few years against a European
coalition we cannot tell in any detail.  She drove the Austrians for
ever out of Belgium, and made Holland a republic.  The Dutch fleet,
frozen in the Texel, surrendered to a handful of cavalry without firing
its guns. For some time the French thrust towards Italy was hung up,
and it was only in 1796 that a new general, Napoleon Bonaparte, led the
ragged and hungry republican armies in triumph across Piedmont to
Mantua and Verona.  Says C. F. Atkinson,  [1] “What astonished the
Allies most of all was the number and the velocity of the Republicans. 
These improvised armies had in fact nothing to delay them.  Tents were
unprocurable for want of money, untransportable for want of the
enormous number of wagons that would have been required, and also
unnecessary, for the discomfort that would have caused wholesale
desertion in professional armies was cheerfully borne by the men of
1793- 94.   Supplies for armies of then unheard-of size could not be
carried in convoys, and the French soon became familiar with ‘living on
the country.’  Thus 1793 saw the birth of the modern system of
war—rapidity of movement, full development of national strength,
bivouacs, requisitions and force as against cautious manœuvring, small
professional armies, tents and full rations, and chicane. The first
represented the decision-compelling spirit, the second the spirit of
risking little to gain a little ... .”

And while these ragged hosts of enthusiasts were chanting the
Marseillaise and fighting for _la France_, manifestly never quite clear
in their minds whether they were looting or liberating the countries
into which they poured, the republican enthusiasm in Paris was spending
itself in a far less glorious fashion.  The revolution was now under
the sway of a fanatical leader, Robespierre.  This man is difficult to
judge; he was a man of poor physique, naturally timid, and a prig.  But
he had that most necessary gift for power, faith. He set himself to
save the Republic as he conceived it, and he imagined it could be saved
by no other man than he.  So that to keep in power was to save the
Republic.  The living spirit of the Republic, it seemed, had sprung
from a slaughter of royalists and the execution of the king.  There
were insurrections; one in the west, in the district of La Vendée,
where the people rose against the conscription and against the
dispossession of the orthodox clergy, and were led by noblemen and
priests; one in the south, where Lyons and Marseilles had risen and the
royalists of Toulon had admitted an English and Spanish garrison.  To
which there seemed no more effectual reply than to go on killing
royalists.

The Revolutionary Tribunal went to work, and a steady slaughtering
began.  The invention of the guillotine was opportune to this mood. 
The queen was guillotined, most of Robespierre’s antagonists were
guillotined, atheists who argued that there was no Supreme Being were
guillotined; day by day, week by week, this infernal new machine
chopped off heads and more heads and more.  The reign of Robespierre
lived, it seemed, on blood; and needed more and more, as an opium-taker
needs more and more opium.


THE EXECUTION OF MARIE ANTOINETTE, QUEEN OF FRANCE, OCTOBER 16, 1793
THE EXECUTION OF MARIE ANTOINETTE, QUEEN OF FRANCE, OCTOBER 16, 1793

_(From a print in the British Museum)_


Finally in the summer of 1794 Robespierre himself was overthrown and
guillotined.  He was succeeded by a Directory of five men which carried
on the war of defence abroad and held France together at home for five
years.  Their reign formed a curious interlude in this history of
violent changes.  They took things as they found them.  The
propagandist zeal of the revolution carried the French armies into
Holland, Belgium, Switzerland, south Germany and north Italy. 
Everywhere kings were expelled and republics set up. But such
propagandist zeal as animated the Directorate did not prevent the
looting of the treasures of the liberated peoples to relieve the
financial embarrassment of the French Government.  Their wars became
less and less the holy wars of freedom, and more and more like the
aggressive wars of the ancient regime.  The last feature of Grand
Monarchy that France was disposed to discard was her tradition of
foreign policy.  One discovers it still as vigorous under the
Directorate as if there had been no revolution.

Unhappily for France and the world a man arose who embodied in its
intensest form this national egotism of the French. He gave that
country ten years of glory and the humiliation of a final defeat.  This
was that same Napoleon Bonaparte who had led the armies of the
Directory to victory in Italy.

Throughout the five years of the Directorate he had been scheming and
working for self-advancement.  Gradually he clambered to supreme power.
 He was a man of severely limited understanding but of ruthless
directness and great energy. He had begun life as an extremist of the
school of Robespierre; he owed his first promotion to that side; but he
had no real grasp of the new forces that were working in Europe.  His
utmost political imagination carried him to a belated and tawdry
attempt to restore the Western Empire.  He tried to destroy the remains
of the old Holy Roman Empire, intending to replace it by a new one
centring upon Paris. The Emperor in Vienna ceased to be the Holy Roman
Emperor and became simply Emperor of Austria.  Napoleon divorced his
French wife in order to marry an Austrian princess.

He became practically monarch of France as First Consul in 1799, and he
made himself Emperor of France in 1804 in direct imitation of
Charlemagne.  He was crowned by the Pope in Paris, taking the crown
from the Pope and putting it upon his own head himself as Charlemagne
had directed.  His son was crowned King of Rome.

For some years Napoleon’s reign was a career of victory.  He conquered
most of Italy and Spain, defeated Prussia and Austria, and dominated
all Europe west of Russia.  But he never won the command of the sea
from the British and his fleets sustained a conclusive defeat inflicted
by the British Admiral Nelson at Trafalgar (1805). Spain rose against
him in 1808 and a British army under Wellington thrust the French
armies slowly northward out of the peninsula.  In 1811 Napoleon came
into conflict with the Tsar Alexander I, and in 1812 he invaded Russia
with a great conglomerate army of 600,000 men, that was defeated and
largely destroyed by the Russians and the Russian winter. Germany rose
against him, Sweden turned against him.  The French armies were beaten
back and at Fontainebleau Napoleon abdicated (1814).  He was exiled to
Elba, returned to France for one last effort in 1815 and was defeated
by the allied British, Belgians and Prussians at Waterloo.  He died a
British prisoner at St. Helena in 1821.

The forces released by the French revolution were wasted and finished. 
A great Congress of the victorious allies met at Vienna to restore as
far as possible the state of affairs that the great storm had rent to
pieces.  For nearly forty years a sort of peace, a peace of exhausted
effort, was maintained in Europe.

Britannica.




LVI
THE UNEASY PEACE IN EUROPE THAT FOLLOWED THE FALL OF NAPOLEON


Two main causes prevented that period from being a complete social and
international peace, and prepared the way for the cycle of wars between
1854 and 1871. The first of these was the tendency of the royal courts
concerned, towards the restoration of unfair privilege and interference
with freedom of thought and writing and teaching. The second was the
impossible system of boundaries drawn by the diplomatists of Vienna.

The inherent disposition of monarchy to march back towards past
conditions was first and most particularly manifest in Spain.  Here
even the Inquisition was restored.  Across the Atlantic the Spanish
colonies had followed the example of the United States and revolted
against the European Great Power System, when Napoleon set his brother
Joseph on the Spanish throne in 1810.  The George Washington of South
America was General Bolivar.  Spain was unable to suppress this revolt,
it dragged on much as the United States War of Independence had dragged
on, and at last the suggestion was made by Austria, in accordance with
the spirit of the Holy Alliance, that the European monarch should
assist Spain in this struggle.  This was opposed by Britain in Europe,
but it was the prompt action of President Monroe of the United States
in 1823 which conclusively warned off this projected monarchist
restoration.  He announced that the United States would regard any
extension of the European system in the Western Hemisphere as a hostile
act.  Thus arose the Monroe Doctrine, the doctrine that there must be
no extension of extra- American government in America, which has kept
the Great Power system out of America for nearly a hundred years and
permitted the new states of Spanish America to work out their destinies
along their own lines.

But if Spanish monarchism lost its colonies, it could at least, under
the protection of the Concert of Europe, do what it chose in Europe.  A
popular insurrection in Spain was crushed by a French army in 1823,
with a mandate from a European congress, and simultaneously Austria
suppressed a revolution in Naples.

In 1824 Louis XVIII died, and was succeeded by Charles X. Charles set
himself to destroy the liberty of the press and universities, and to
restore absolute government; the sum of a billion francs was voted to
compensate the nobles for the chateau burnings and sequestrations of
1789.  In 1830 Paris rose against this embodiment of the ancient
regime, and replaced him by Louis Philippe, the son of that Philip,
Duke of Orleans, who was executed during the Terror.  The other
continental monarchies, in face of the open approval of the revolution
by Great Britain and a strong liberal ferment in Germany and Austria,
did not interfere in this affair.  After all, France was still a
monarchy.  This man Louis Philippe (1830-48) remained the
constitutional King of France for eighteen years.

Such were the uneasy swayings of the peace of the Congress of Vienna,
which were provoked by the reactionary proceedings of the monarchists. 
The stresses that arose from the unscientific boundaries planned by the
diplomatists at Vienna gathered force more deliberately, but they were
even more dangerous to the peace of mankind.  It is extraordinarily
inconvenient to administer together the affairs of peoples speaking
different languages and so reading different literatures and having
different general ideas, especially if those differences are
exacerbated by religious disputes. Only some strong mutual interest,
such as the common defensive needs of the Swiss mountaineers, can
justify a close linking of peoples of dissimilar languages and faiths;
and even in Switzerland there is the utmost local autonomy. When, as in
Macedonia, populations are mixed in a patchwork of villages and
districts, the cantonal system is imperatively needed.  But if the
reader will look at the map of Europe as the Congress of Vienna drew
it, he will see that this gathering seems almost as if it had planned
the maximum of local exasperation.

It destroyed the Dutch Republic, quite needlessly, it lumped together
the Protestant Dutch with the French-speaking Catholics of the old
Spanish (Austrian) Netherlands, and set up a kingdom of the
Netherlands.  It handed over not merely the old republic of Venice, but
all of North Italy as far as Milan to the German-speaking Austrians. 
French-speaking Savoy it combined with pieces of Italy to restore the
kingdom of Sardinia.  Austria and Hungary, already a sufficiently
explosive mixture of discordant nationalities, Germans, Hungarians,
Czecho-Slovaks, Jugo-Slavs, Roumanians, and now Italians, was made
still more impossible by confirming Austria’s Polish acquisitions of
1772 and 1795.  The Catholic and republican-spirited Polish people were
chiefly given over to the less civilized rule of the Greek-orthodox
Tsar, but important districts went to Protestant Prussia. The Tsar was
also confirmed in his acquisition of the entirely alien Finns.  The
very dissimilar Norwegian and Swedish peoples were bound together under
one king.  Germany, the reader will see, was left in a particularly
dangerous state of muddle.  Prussia and Austria were both partly in and
partly out of a German confederation, which included a multitude of
minor states.  The King of Denmark came into the German confederation
by virtue of certain German-speaking possessions in Holstein. 
Luxembourg was included in the German confederation, though its ruler
was also King of the Netherlands, and though many of its peoples talked
French.

Here was a complete disregard of the fact that the people who talk
German and base their ideas on German literature, the people who talk
Italian and base their ideas on Italian literature, and the people who
talk Polish and base their ideas on Polish literature, will all be far
better off and most helpful and least obnoxious to the rest of mankind
if they conduct their own affairs in their own idiom within the
ring-fence of their own speech.  Is it any wonder that one of the most
popular songs in Germany during this period declared that wherever the
German tongue was spoken, there was the German Fatherland!

_(From a print in the British Museum)_


In 1830 French-speaking Belgium, stirred up by the current revolution
in France, revolted against its Dutch association in the kingdom of the
Netherlands.  The powers, terrified at the possibilities of a republic
or of annexation to France, hurried in to pacify this situation, and
gave the Belgians a monarch, Leopold I of Saxe-Coburg Gotha.  There
were also ineffectual revolts in Italy and Germany in 1830, and a much
more serious one in Russian Poland.  A republican government held out
in Warsaw for a year against Nicholas I (who succeeded Alexander in
1825), and was then stamped out of existence with great violence and
cruelty.  The Polish language was banned, and the Greek Orthodox church
was substituted for the Roman Catholic as the state religion ....


Map: Europe after the Congress of Vienna

In 1821 there was an insurrection of the Greeks against the Turks.  For
six years they fought a desperate war, while the governments of Europe
looked on.  Liberal opinion protested against this inactivity;
volunteers from every European country joined the insurgents, and at
last Britain, France and Russia took joint action.  The Turkish fleet
was destroyed by the French and English at the battle of Navarino
(1827), and the Tsar invaded Turkey.  By the treaty of Adrianople
(1829) Greece was declared free, but she was not permitted to resume
her ancient republican traditions.  A German king was found for Greece,
one Prince Otto of Bavaria, and Christian governors were set up in the
Danubian provinces (which are now Roumania) and Serbia (a part of the
Jugo-Slav region).  Much blood had still to run however before the Turk
was altogether expelled from these lands.




LVII
THE DEVELOPMENT OF MATERIAL KNOWLEDGE


Throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and the opening
years of the nineteenth century, while these conflicts of the powers
and princes were going on in Europe, and the patchwork of the treaty of
Westphalia (1648) was changing kaleidoscopically into the patchwork of
the treaty of Vienna (1815), and while the sailing ship was spreading
European influence throughout the world, a steady growth of knowledge
and a general clearing up of men’s ideas about the world in which they
lived was in progress in the European and Europeanized world.

It went on disconnected from political life, and producing throughout
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries no striking immediate results
in political life.  Nor was it affecting popular thought very
profoundly during this period. These reactions were to come later, and
only in their full force in the latter half of the nineteenth century. 
It was a process that went on chiefly in a small world of prosperous
and independent-spirited people.  Without what the English call the
“private gentleman,” the scientific process could not have begun in
Greece, and could not have been renewed in Europe.  The universities
played a part but not a leading part in the philosophical and
scientific thought of this period.  Endowed learning is apt to be timid
and conservative learning, lacking in initiative and resistent to
innovation, unless it has the spur of contact with independent minds.

We have already noted the formation of the Royal Society in 1662 and
its work in realizing the dream of Bacon’s _New Atlantis_.  Throughout
the eighteenth century there was much clearing up of general ideas
about matter and motion, much mathematical advance, a systematic
development of the use of optical glass in microscope and telescope, a
renewed energy in classificatory natural history, a great revival of
anatomical science.  The science of geology—foreshadowed by Aristotle
and anticipated by Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519)—began its great task
of interpreting the Record of the Rocks.

The progress of physical science reacted upon metallurgy. Improved
metallurgy, affording the possibility of a larger and bolder handling
of masses of metal and other materials, reacted upon practical
inventions.  Machinery on a new scale and in a new abundance appeared
to revolutionize industry.

In 1804 Trevithick adapted the Watt engine to transport and made the
first locomotive.  In 1825 the first railway, between Stockton and
Darlington, was opened, and Stephenson’s “Rocket,” with a thirteen-ton
train, got up to a speed of forty-four miles per hour.  From 1830
onward railways multiplied.  By the middle of the century a network of
railways had spread all over Europe.


EARLY TRAVELLING ON THE LIVERPOOL AND MANCHESTER RAILWAY, 1833
EARLY TRAVELLING ON THE LIVERPOOL AND MANCHESTER RAILWAY, 1833


Here was a sudden change in what had long been a fixed condition of
human life, the maximum rate of land transport. After the Russian
disaster, Napoleon travelled from near Vilna to Paris in 312 hours. 
This was a journey of about 1,400 miles.  He was travelling with every
conceivable advantage, and he averaged under 5 miles an hour.  An
ordinary traveller could not have done this distance in twice the time.
 These were about the same maximum rates of travel as held good between
Rome and Gaul in the first century A.D.  Then suddenly came this
tremendous change.  The railways reduced this journey for any ordinary
traveller to less than forty-eight hours.  That is to say, they reduced
the chief European distances to about a tenth of what they had been. 
They made it possible to carry out administrative work in areas ten
times as great as any that had hitherto been workable under one
administration.  The full significance of that possibility in Europe
still remains to be realized.  Europe is still netted in boundaries
drawn in the horse and road era.  In America the effects were
immediate.  To the United States of America, sprawling westward, it
meant the possibility of a continuous access to Washington, however far
the frontier travelled across the continent.  It meant unity, sustained
on a scale that would otherwise have been impossible.

THE STEAMBOAT: _CLERMONT_, 1807, U.S.A.


The steamboat was, if anything, a little ahead of the steam engine in
its earlier phases.  There was a steamboat, the _Charlotte Dundas_, on
the Firth of Clyde Canal in 1802, and in 1807 an American named Fulton
had a steamer, the Clermont, with British-built engines, upon the
Hudson River above New York.  The first steamship to put to sea was
also an American, the Phœnix, which went from New York (Hoboken) to
Philadelphia.  So, too, was the first ship using steam (she also had
sails) to cross the Atlantic, the Savannah (1819).  All these were
paddle-wheel boats and paddle-wheel boats are not adapted to work in
heavy seas. The paddles smash too easily, and the boat is then
disabled. The screw steamship followed rather slowly.  Many
difficulties had to be surmounted before the screw was a practicable
thing.  Not until the middle of the century did the tonnage of
steamships upon the sea begin to overhaul that of sailing ships.  After
that the evolution in sea transport was rapid.  For the first time men
began to cross the seas and oceans with some certainty as to the date
of their arrival.  The transatlantic crossing, which had been an
uncertain adventure of several weeks—which might stretch to months—was
accelerated, until in 1910 it was brought down, in the case of the
fastest boats, to under five days, with a practically notifiable hour
of arrival.

Concurrently with the development of steam transport upon land and sea
a new and striking addition to the facilities of human intercourse
arose out of the investigations of Volta, Galvani and Faraday into
various electrical phenomena.  The electric telegraph came into
existence in 1835.  The first underseas cable was laid in 1851 between
France and England. In a few years the telegraph system had spread over
the civilized world, and news which had hitherto travelled slowly from
point to point became practically simultaneous throughout the earth.

These things, the steam railway and the electric telegraph, were to the
popular imagination of the middle nineteenth century the most striking
and revolutionary of inventions, but they were only the most
conspicuous and clumsy first fruits of a far more extensive process. 
Technical knowledge and skill were developing with an extraordinary
rapidity, and to an extraordinary extent measured by the progress of
any previous age.  Far less conspicuous at first in everyday life, but
finally far more important, was the extension of man’s power over
various structural materials.  Before the middle of the eighteenth
century iron was reduced from its ores by means of wood charcoal, was
handled in small pieces, and hammered and wrought into shape. It was
material for a craftsman.  Quality and treatment were enormously
dependent upon the experience and sagacity of the individual
iron-worker.  The largest masses of iron that could be dealt with under
those conditions amounted at most (in the sixteenth century) to two or
three tons.  (There was a very definite upward limit, therefore, to the
size of cannon.)  The blast-furnace rose in the eighteenth century and
developed with the use of coke.  Not before the eighteenth century do
we find rolled sheet iron (1728) and rolled rods and bars (1783). 
Nasmyth’s steam hammer came as late as 1838.

The ancient world, because of its metallurgical inferiority, could not
use steam.  The steam engine, even the primitive pumping engine, could
not develop before sheet iron was available.  The early engines seem to
the modern eye very pitiful and clumsy bits of ironmongery, but they
were the utmost that the metallurgical science of the time could do. As
late as 1856 came the Bessemer process, and presently (1864) the
open-hearth process, in which steel and every sort of iron could be
melted, purified and cast in a manner and upon a scale hitherto unheard
of.  To-day in the electric furnace one may see tons of incandescent
steel swirling about like boiling milk in a saucepan.  Nothing in the
previous practical advances of mankind is comparable in its
consequences to the complete mastery over enormous masses of steel and
iron and over their texture and quality which man has now achieved. 
The railways and early engines of all sorts were the mere first
triumphs of the new metallurgical methods.  Presently came ships of
iron and steel, vast bridges, and a new way of building with steel upon
a gigantic scale.  Men realized too late that they had planned their
railways with far too timid a gauge, that they could have organized
their travelling with far more steadiness and comfort upon a much
bigger scale.

Before the nineteenth century there were no ships in the world much
over 2,000 tons burthen; now there is nothing wonderful about a
50,000-ton liner.  There are people who sneer at this kind of progress
as being a progress in “mere size,” but that sort of sneering merely
marks the intellectual limitations of those who indulge in it.  The
great ship or the steel-frame building is not, as they imagine, a
magnified version of the small ship or building of the past; it is a
thing different in kind, more lightly and strongly built, of finer and
stronger materials; instead of being a thing of precedent and
rule-of-thumb, it is a thing of subtle and intricate calculation.  In
the old house or ship, matter was dominant—the material and its needs
had to be slavishly obeyed; in the new, matter had been captured,
changed, coerced.  Think of the coal and iron and sand dragged out of
the banks and pits, wrenched, wrought, molten and cast, to be flung at
last, a slender glittering pinnacle of steel and glass, six hundred
feet above the crowded city!

We have given these particulars of the advance in man’s knowledge of
the metallurgy of steel and its results by way of illustration.  A
parallel story could be told of the metallurgy of copper and tin, and
of a multitude of metals, nickel and aluminium to name but two, unknown
before the nineteenth century dawned.  It is in this great and growing
mastery over substances, over different sorts of glass, over rocks and
plasters and the like, over colours and textures, that the main
triumphs of the mechanical revolution have thus far been achieved.  Yet
we are still in the stage of the first fruits in the matter.  We have
the power, but we have still to learn how to use our power.  Many of
the first employments of these gifts of science have been vulgar,
tawdry, stupid or horrible.  The artist and the adaptor have still
hardly begun to work with the endless variety of substances now at
their disposal.

Parallel with this extension of mechanical possibilities the new
science of electricity grew up.  It was only in the eighties of the
nineteenth century that this body of enquiry began to yield results to
impress the vulgar mind.  Then suddenly came electric light and
electric traction, and the transmutation of forces, the possibility of
sending power, that could be changed into mechanical motion or light or
heat as one chose, along a copper wire, as water is sent along a pipe,
began to come through to the ideas of ordinary people....

The British and French were at first the leading peoples in this great
proliferation of knowledge; but presently the Germans, who had learnt
humility under Napoleon, showed such zeal and pertinacity in scientific
enquiry as to overhaul these leaders.  British science was largely the
creation of Englishmen and Scotchmen working outside the ordinary
centres of erudition.

The universities of Britain were at this time in a state of educational
retrogression, largely given over to a pedantic conning of the Latin
and Greek classics.  French education, too, was dominated by the
classical tradition of the Jesuit schools, and consequently it was not
difficult for the Germans to organize a body of investigators, small
indeed in relation to the possibilities of the case, but large in
proportion to the little band of British and French inventors and
experimentalists.  And though this work of research and experiment was
making Britain and France the most rich and powerful countries in the
world, it was not making scientific and inventive men rich and
powerful.  There is a necessary unworldliness about a sincere
scientific man; he is too preoccupied with his research to plan and
scheme how to make money out of it.  The economic exploitation of his
discoveries falls very easily and naturally, therefore, into the hands
of a more acquisitive type; and so we find that the crops of rich men
which every fresh phase of scientific and technical progress has
produced in Great Britain, though they have not displayed quite the
same passionate desire to insult and kill the goose that laid the
national golden eggs as the scholastic and clerical professions, have
been quite content to let that profitable creature starve.  Inventors
and discoverers came by nature, they thought, for cleverer people to
profit by.

In this matter the Germans were a little wiser.  The German “learned”
did not display the same vehement hatred of the new learning.  They
permitted its development. The German business man and manufacturer
again had not quite the same contempt for the man of science as had his
British competitor.  Knowledge, these Germans believed, might be a
cultivated crop, responsive to fertilizers.  They did concede,
therefore, a certain amount of opportunity to the scientific mind;
their public expenditure on scientific work was relatively greater, and
this expenditure was abundantly rewarded.  By the latter half of the
nineteenth century the German scientific worker had made German a
necessary language for every science student who wished to keep abreast
with the latest work in his department, and in certain branches, and
particularly in chemistry, Germany acquired a very great superiority
over her western neighbours.  The scientific effort of the sixties and
seventies in Germany began to tell after the eighties, and the German
gained steadily upon Britain and France in technical and industrial
prosperity.

A fresh phase in the history of invention opened when in the eighties a
new type of engine came into use, an engine in which the expansive
force of an explosive mixture replaced the expansive force of steam. 
The light, highly efficient engines that were thus made possible were
applied to the automobile, and developed at last to reach such a pitch
of lightness and efficiency as to render flight—long known to be
possible—a practical achievement.  A successful flying machine—but not
a machine large enough to take up a human body—was made by Professor
Langley of the Smithsonian Institute of Washington as early as 1897. 
By 1909 the aeroplane was available for human locomotion.  There had
seemed to be a pause in the increase of human speed with the perfection
of railways and automobile road traction, but with the flying machine
came fresh reductions in the effective distance between one point of
the earth’s surface and another.  In the eighteenth century the
distance from London to Edinburgh was an eight days’ journey; in 1918
the British Civil Air Transport Commission reported that the journey
from London to Melbourne, halfway round the earth, would probably in a
few years’ time be accomplished in that same period of eight days.

Too much stress must not be laid upon these striking reductions in the
time distances of one place from another. They are merely one aspect of
a much profounder and more momentous enlargement of human possibility. 
The science of agriculture and agricultural chemistry, for instance,
made quite parallel advances during the nineteenth century.  Men learnt
so to fertilize the soil as to produce quadruple and quintuple the
crops got from the same area in the seventeenth century.  There was a
still more extraordinary advance in medical science; the average
duration of life rose, the daily efficiency increased, the waste of
life through ill-health diminished.

Now here altogether we have such a change in human life as to
constitute a fresh phase of history.  In a little more than a century
this mechanical revolution has been brought about. In that time man
made a stride in the material conditions of his life vaster than he had
done during the whole long interval between the palæolithic stage and
the age of cultivation, or between the days of Pepi in Egypt and those
of George III.  A new gigantic material framework for human affairs has
come into existence.  Clearly it demands great readjustments of our
social, economical and political methods.  But these readjustments have
necessarily waited upon the development of the mechanical revolution,
and they are still only in their opening stage to-day.




LVIII
THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION


There is a tendency in many histories to confuse together what we have
here called the mechanical revolution, which was an entirely new thing
in human experience arising out of the development of organized
science, a new step like the invention of agriculture or the discovery
of metals, with something else, quite different in its origins,
something for which there was already an historical precedent, the
social and financial development which is called the _industrial
revolution_. The two processes were going on together, they were
constantly reacting upon each other, but they were in root and essence
different. There would have been an industrial revolution of sorts if
there had been no coal, no steam, no machinery; but in that case it
would probably have followed far more closely upon the lines of the
social and financial developments of the later years of the Roman
Republic. It would have repeated the story of dispossessed free
cultivators, gang labour, great estates, great financial fortunes, and
a socially destructive financial process. Even the factory method came
before power and machinery. Factories were the product not of
machinery, but of the “division of labour.” Drilled and sweated workers
were making such things as millinery cardboard boxes and furniture, and
colouring maps and book illustrations and so forth, before even
water-wheels had been used for industrial purposes. There were
factories in Rome in the days of Augustus. New books, for instance,
were dictated to rows of copyists in the factories of the book-sellers.
The attentive student of Defoe and of the political pamphlets of
Fielding will realize that the idea of herding poor people into
establishments to work collectively for their living was already
current in Britain before the close of the seventeenth century. There
are intimations of it even as early as More’s _Utopia_ (1516). It was a
social and not a mechanical development.

Up to past the middle of the eighteenth century the social and economic
history of western Europe was in fact retreading the path along which
the Roman state had gone in the last three centuries B.C.  But the
political disunions of Europe, the political convulsions against
monarchy, the recalcitrance of the common folk and perhaps also the
greater accessibility of the western European intelligence to
mechanical ideas and inventions, turned the process into quite novel
directions.  Ideas of human solidarity, thanks to Christianity, were
far more widely diffused in the newer European world, political power
was not so concentrated, and the man of energy anxious to get rich
turned his mind, therefore, very willingly from the ideas of the slave
and of gang labour to the idea of mechanical power and the machine.

The mechanical revolution, the process of mechanical invention and
discovery, was a new thing in human experience and it went on
regardless of the social, political, economic and industrial
consequences it might produce.  The industrial revolution, on the other
hand, like most other human affairs, was and is more and more
profoundly changed and deflected by the constant variation in human
conditions caused by the mechanical revolution.  And the essential
difference between the amassing of riches, the extinction of small
farmers and small business men, and the phase of big finance in the
latter centuries of the Roman Republic on the one hand, and the very
similar concentration of capital in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries on the other, lies in the profound difference in the
character of labour that the mechanical revolution was bringing about. 
The power of the old world was human power; everything depended
ultimately upon the driving power of human muscle, the muscle of
ignorant and subjugated men.  A little animal muscle, supplied by draft
oxen, horse traction and the like, contributed.  Where a weight had to
be lifted, men lifted it; where a rock had to be quarried, men chipped
it out; where a field had to be ploughed, men and oxen ploughed it; the
Roman equivalent of the steamship was the galley with its bank of
sweating rowers.  A vast proportion of mankind in the early
civilizations were employed in purely mechanical drudgery. At its
onset, power-driven machinery did not seem to promise any release from
such unintelligent toil.  Great gangs of men were employed in
excavating canals, in making railway cuttings and embankments, and the
like.  The number of miners increased enormously.  But the extension of
facilities and the output of commodities increased much more.  And as
the nineteenth century went on, the plain logic of the new situation
asserted itself more clearly.  Human beings were no longer wanted as a
source of mere indiscriminated power.  What could be done mechanically
by a human being could be done faster and better by a machine.  The
human being was needed now only where choice and intelligence had to be
exercised.  Human beings were wanted only as human beings.  The drudge,
on whom all the previous civilizations had rested, the creature of mere
obedience, the man whose brains were superfluous, had become
unnecessary to the welfare of mankind.

This was as true of such ancient industries as agriculture and mining
as it was of the newest metallurgical processes. For ploughing, sowing
and harvesting, swift machines came forward to do the work of scores of
men.  The Roman civilization was built upon cheap and degraded human
beings; modern civilization is being rebuilt upon cheap mechanical
power.  For a hundred years power has been getting cheaper and labour
dearer.  If for a generation or so machinery has had to wait its turn
in the mine, it is simply because for a time men were cheaper than
machinery.

Now here was a change-over of quite primary importance in human
affairs.  The chief solicitude of the rich and of the ruler in the old
civilization had been to keep up a supply of drudges.  As the
nineteenth century went on, it became more and more plain to the
intelligent directive people that the common man had now to be
something better than a drudge.  He had to be educated—if only to
secure “industrial efficiency.”  He had to understand what he was
about. From the days of the first Christian propaganda, popular
education had been smouldering in Europe, just as it had smouldered in
Asia wherever Islam has set its foot, because of the necessity of
making the believer understand a little of the belief by which he is
saved, and of enabling him to read a little in the sacred books by
which his belief is conveyed. Christian controversies, with their
competition for adherents, ploughed the ground for the harvest of
popular education.  In England, for instance, by the thirties and
forties of the nineteenth century, the disputes of the sects and the
necessity of catching adherents young had produced a series of
competing educational organizations for children, the church “National”
schools, the dissenting “British” schools, and even Roman Catholic
elementary schools.  The second half of the nineteenth century was a
period of rapid advance in popular education throughout all the
Westernized world.  There was no parallel advance in the education of
the upper classes—some advance, no doubt, but nothing to correspond—and
so the great gulf that had divided that world hitherto into the readers
and the non-reading mass became little more than a slightly perceptible
difference in educational level.  At the back of this process was the
mechanical revolution, apparently regardless of social conditions, but
really insisting inexorably upon the complete abolition of a totally
illiterate class throughout the world.

The economic revolution of the Roman Republic had never been clearly
apprehended by the common people of Rome.  The ordinary Roman citizen
never saw the changes through which he lived, clearly and
comprehensively as we see them.  But the industrial revolution, as it
went on towards the end of the nineteenth century, was more and more
distinctly _seen_ as one whole process by the common people it was
affecting, because presently they could read and discuss and
communicate, and because they went about and saw things as no
commonalty had ever done before.




LIX
THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN POLITICAL AND SOCIAL IDEAS


The institutions and customs and political ideas of the ancient
civilizations grew up slowly, age by age, no man designing and no man
foreseeing. It was only in that great century of human adolescence, the
sixth century B.C., that men began to think clearly about their
relations to one another, and first to question and first propose to
alter and rearrange the established beliefs and laws and methods of
human government.

We have told of the glorious intellectual dawn of Greece and
Alexandria, and how presently the collapse of the slave- holding
civilizations and the clouds of religious intolerance and absolutist
government darkened the promise of that beginning.  The light of
fearless thinking did not break through the European obscurity again
effectually until the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.  We have tried
to show something of the share of the great winds of Arab curiosity and
Mongol conquest in this gradual clearing of the mental skies of Europe.
 And at first it was chiefly material knowledge that increased.  The
first fruits of the recovered manhood of the race were material
achievements and material power.  The science of human relationship, of
individual and social psychology, of education and of economics, are
not only more subtle and intricate in themselves but also bound up
inextricably with much emotional matter.  The advances made in them
have been slower and made against greater opposition.  Men will listen
dispassionately to the most diverse suggestions about stars or
molecules, but ideas about our ways of life touch and reflect upon
everyone about us.

And just as in Greece the bold speculations of Plato came before
Aristotle’s hard search for fact, so in Europe the first political
enquiries of the new phase were put in the form of “Utopian” stories,
directly imitated from Plato’s _Republic_ and his _Laws_.  Sir Thomas
More’s _Utopia_ is a curious imitation of Plato that bore fruit in a
new English poor law.  The Neapolitan Campanella’s _City of the Sun_
was more fantastic and less fruitful.

By the end of the seventeenth century we find a considerable and
growing literature of political and social science was being produced. 
Among the pioneers in this discussion was John Locke, the son of an
English republican, an Oxford scholar who first directed his attention
to chemistry and medicine.  His treatises on government, toleration and
education show a mind fully awake to the possibilities of social
reconstruction.  Parallel with and a little later than John Locke in
England, Montesquieu (1689-1755) in France subjected social, political
and religious institutions to a searching and fundamental analysis.  He
stripped the magical prestige from the absolutist monarchy in France. 
He shares with Locke the credit for clearing away many of the false
ideas that had hitherto prevented deliberate and conscious attempts to
reconstruct human society.

The generation that followed him in the middle and later decades of the
eighteenth century was boldly speculative upon the moral and
intellectual clearings he had made.  A group of brilliant writers, the
“Encyclopædists,” mostly rebel spirits from the excellent schools of
the Jesuits, set themselves to scheme out a new world (1766). Side by
side with the Encyclopædists were the Economists or Physiocrats, who
were making bold and crude enquiries into the production and
distribution of food and goods.  Morelly, the author of the _Code de La
Nature_, denounced the institution of private property and proposed a
communistic organization of society.  He was the precursor of that
large and various school of collectivist thinkers in the nineteenth
century who are lumped together as Socialists.

What is Socialism?  There are a hundred definitions of Socialism and a
thousand sects of Socialists.  Essentially Socialism is no more and no
less than a criticism of the idea of property in the light of the
public good.  We may review the history of that idea through the ages
very briefly.  That and the idea of internationalism are the two
cardinal ideas upon which most of our political life is turning.

The idea of property arises out of the combative instincts of the
species.  Long before men were men, the ancestral ape was a proprietor.
 Primitive property is what a beast will fight for.  The dog and his
bone, the tigress and her lair, the roaring stag and his herd, these
are proprietorship blazing. No more nonsensical expression is
conceivable in sociology than the term “primitive communism.”  The Old
Man of the family tribe of early palæolithic times insisted upon his
proprietorship in his wives and daughters, in his tools, in his visible
universe.  If any other man wandered into his visible universe he
fought him, and if he could he slew him. The tribe grew in the course
of ages, as Atkinson showed convincingly in his _Primal Law_, by the
gradual toleration by the Old Man of the existence of the younger men,
and of their proprietorship in the wives they captured from outside the
tribe, and in the tools and ornaments they made and the game they slew.
 Human society grew by a compromise between this one’s property and
that.  It was a compromise with instinct which was forced upon men by
the necessity of driving some other tribe out of its visible universe. 
If the hills and forests and streams were not _your_ land or _my_ land,
it was because they had to be our land.  Each of us would have
preferred to have it _my_ land, but that would not work.  In that case
the other fellows would have destroyed us.  Society, therefore, is from
its beginning a _mitigation of ownership_. Ownership in the beast and
in the primitive savage was far more intense a thing than it is in the
civilized world to- day.  It is rooted more strongly in our instincts
than in our reason.

In the natural savage and in the untutored man to-day there is no
limitation to the sphere of ownership.  Whatever you can fight for, you
can own; women-folk, spared captive, captured beast, forest glade,
stone-pit or what not.  As the community grew, a sort of law came to
restrain internecine fighting, men developed rough-and-ready methods of
settling proprietorship.  Men could own what they were the first to
make or capture or claim.  It seemed natural that a debtor who could
not pay should become the property of his creditor. Equally natural was
it that after claiming a patch of land a man should exact payments from
anyone who wanted to use it. It was only slowly, as the possibilities
of organized life dawned on men, that this unlimited property in
anything whatever began to be recognized as a nuisance.  Men found
themselves born into a universe all owned and claimed, nay! they found
themselves born owned and claimed.  The social struggles of the earlier
civilization are difficult to trace now, but the history we have told
of the Roman Republic shows a community waking up to the idea that
debts may become a public inconvenience and should then be repudiated,
and that the unlimited ownership of land is also an inconvenience.  We
find that later Babylonia severely limited the rights of property in
slaves.  Finally, we find in the teaching of that great revolutionist,
Jesus of Nazareth, such an attack upon property as had never been
before.  Easier it was, he said, for a camel to go through the eye of a
needle than for the owner of great possessions to enter the kingdom of
heaven.  A steady, continuous criticism of the permissible scope of
property seems to have been going on in the world for the last
twenty-five or thirty centuries.  Nineteen hundred years after Jesus of
Nazareth we find all the world that has come under the Christian
teaching persuaded that there could be no property in human beings. 
And also the idea that a man may “do what he likes with his own” was
very much shaken in relation to other sorts of property.

But this world of the closing eighteenth century was still only in the
interrogative stage in this matter.  It had got nothing clear enough,
much less settled enough, to act upon. One of its primary impulses was
to protect property against the greed and waste of kings and the
exploitation of noble adventurers.  It was largely to protect private
property from taxation that the French Revolution began.  But the
equalitarian formulæ of the Revolution carried it into a criticism of
the very property it had risen to protect.  How can men be free and
equal when numbers of them have no ground to stand upon and nothing to
eat, and the owners will neither feed nor lodge them unless they toil? 
Excessively—the poor complained.

To which riddle the reply of one important political group was to set
about “dividing up.”  They wanted to intensify and universalize
property.  Aiming at the same end by another route, there were the
primitive socialists—or, to be more exact, communists—who wanted to
“abolish” private property altogether. The state (a democratic state
was of course understood) was to own all property.

It is paradoxical that different men seeking the same ends of liberty
and happiness should propose on the one hand to make property as
absolute as possible, and on the other to put an end to it altogether. 
But so it was.  And the clue to this paradox is to be found in the fact
that ownership is not one thing but a multitude of different things.

It was only as the nineteenth century developed that men began to
realize that property was not one simple thing, but a great complex of
ownerships of different values and consequences, that many things (such
as one’s body, the implements of an artist, clothing, toothbrushes) are
very profoundly and incurably one’s personal property, and that there
is a very great range of things, railways, machinery of various sorts,
homes, cultivated gardens, pleasure boats, for example, which need each
to be considered very particularly to determine how far and under what
limitations it may come under private ownership, and how far it falls
into the public domain and may be administered and let out by the state
in the collective interest.  On the practical side these questions pass
into politics, and the problem of making and sustaining efficient state
administration.  They open up issues in social psychology, and interact
with the enquiries of educational science.  The criticism of property
is still a vast and passionate ferment rather than a science.  On the
one hand are the Individualists, who would protect and enlarge our
present freedoms with what we possess, and on the other the Socialists
who would in many directions pool our ownerships and restrain our
proprietory acts.  In practice one will find every gradation between
the extreme individualist, who will scarcely tolerate a tax of any sort
to support a government, and the communist who would deny any
possessions at all.  The ordinary socialist of to-day is what is called
a collectivist; he would allow a considerable amount of private
property but put such affairs as education, transport, mines,
land-owning, most mass productions of staple articles, and the like,
into the hands of a highly organized state.  Nowadays there does seem
to be a gradual convergence of reasonable men towards a moderate
socialism scientifically studied and planned.  It is realized more and
more clearly that the untutored man does not co-operate easily and
successfully in large undertakings, and that every step towards a more
complex state and every function that the state takes over from private
enterprise, necessitates a corresponding educational advance and the
organization of a proper criticism and control.  Both the press and the
political methods of the contemporary state are far too crude for any
large extension of collective activities.

But for a time the stresses between employer and employed and
particularly between selfish employers and reluctant workers, led to a
world-wide dissemination of the very harsh and elementary form of
communism which is associated with the name of Marx.  Marx based his
theories on a belief that men’s minds are limited by their economic
necessities, and that there is a necessary conflict of interests in our
present civilization between the prosperous and employing classes of
people and the employed mass.  With the advance in education
necessitated by the mechanical revolution, this great employed majority
will become more and more class-conscious and more and more solid in
antagonism to the (class- conscious) ruling minority.  In some way the
class-conscious workers would seize power, he prophesied, and
inaugurate a new social state.  The antagonism, the insurrection, the
possible revolution are understandable enough, but it does not follow
that a new social state or anything but a socially destructive process
will ensue.  Put to the test in Russia, Marxism, as we shall note
later, has proved singularly uncreative.

Marx sought to replace national antagonism by class antagonisms;
Marxism has produced in succession a First, a Second and a Third
Workers’ International.  But from the starting point of modern
individualistic thought it is also possible to reach international
ideas.  From the days of that great English economist, Adam Smith,
onward there has been an increasing realization that for world-wide
prosperity free and unencumbered trade about the earth is needed.  The
individualist with his hostility to the state is hostile also to
tariffs and boundaries and all the restraints upon free act and
movement that national boundaries seem to justify. It is interesting to
see two lines of thought, so diverse in spirit, so different in
substance as this class-war socialism of the Marxists and the
individualistic free-trading philosophy of the British business men of
the Victorian age heading at last, in spite of these primary
differences, towards the same intimations of a new world-wide treatment
of human affairs outside the boundaries and limitations of any existing
state.  The logic of reality triumphs over the logic of theory.  We
begin to perceive that from widely divergent starting points
individualist theory and socialist theory are part of a common search,
a search for more spacious social and political ideas and
interpretations, upon which men may contrive to work together, a search
that began again in Europe and has intensified as men’s confidence in
the ideas of the Holy Roman Empire and in Christendom decayed, and as
the age of discovery broadened their horizons from the world of the
Mediterranean to the whole wide world.

To bring this description of the elaboration and development of social,
economic and political ideas right down to the discussions of the
present day, would be to introduce issues altogether too controversial
for the scope and intentions of this book.  But regarding these things,
as we do here, from the vast perspectives of the student of world
history, we are bound to recognize that this reconstruction of these
directive ideas in the human mind is still an unfinished task—we cannot
even estimate yet how unfinished the task may be.  Certain common
beliefs do seem to be emerging, and their influence is very perceptible
upon the political events and public acts of to-day; but at present
they are not clear enough nor convincing enough to compel men
definitely and systematically towards their realization.  Men’s acts
waver between tradition and the new, and on the whole they rather
gravitate towards the traditional.  Yet, compared with the thought of
even a brief lifetime ago, there does seem to be an outline shaping
itself of a new order in human affairs.  It is a sketchy outline,
vanishing into vagueness at this point and that, and fluctuating in
detail and formulæ, yet it grows steadfastly clearer, and its main
lines change less and less.

It is becoming plainer and plainer each year that in many respects and
in an increasing range of affairs, mankind is becoming one community,
and that it is more and more necessary that in such matters there
should be a common world-wide control.  For example, it is steadily
truer that the whole planet is now one economic community, that the
proper exploitation of its natural resources demands one comprehensive
direction, and that the greater power and range that discovery has
given human effort makes the present fragmentary and contentious
administration of such affairs more and more wasteful and dangerous. 
Financial and monetary expedients also become world-wide interests to
be dealt with successfully only on world-wide lines.  Infectious
diseases and the increase and migrations of population are also now
plainly seen to be world-wide concerns.  The greater power and range of
human activities has also made war disproportionately destructive and
disorganizing, and, even as a clumsy way of settling issues between
government and government and people and people, ineffective.  All
these things clamour for controls and authorities of a greater range
and greater comprehensiveness than any government that has hitherto
existed.

But it does not follow that the solution of these problems lies in some
super-government of all the world arising by conquest or by the
coalescence of existing governments.  By analogy with existing
institutions men have thought of the Parliament of Mankind, of a World
Congress, of a President or Emperor of the Earth.  Our first natural
reaction is towards some such conclusion, but the discussion and
experiences of half a century of suggestions and attempts has on the
whole discouraged belief in that first obvious idea.  Along that line
to world unity the resistances are too great.  The drift of thought
seems now to be in the direction of a number of special committees or
organizations, with world-wide power delegated to them by existing
governments in this group of matters or that, bodies concerned with the
waste or development of natural wealth, with the equalization of labour
conditions, with world peace, with currency, population and health, and
so forth.

The world may discover that all its common interests are being managed
as one concern, while it still fails to realize that a world government
exists.  But before even so much human unity is attained, before such
international arrangements can be put above patriotic suspicions and
jealousies, it is necessary that the common mind of the race should be
possessed of that idea of human unity, and that the idea of mankind as
one family should be a matter of universal instruction and
understanding.

For a score of centuries or more the spirit of the great universal
religions has been struggling to maintain and extend that idea of a
universal human brotherhood, but to this day the spites, angers and
distrusts of tribal, national and racial friction obstruct, and
successfully obstruct, the broader views and more generous impulses
which would make every man the servant of all mankind.  The idea of
human brotherhood struggles now to possess the human soul, just as the
idea of Christendom struggled to possess the soul of Europe in the
confusion and disorder of the sixth and seventh centuries of the
Christian era.  The dissemination and triumph of such ideas must be the
work of a multitude of devoted and undistinguished missionaries, and no
contemporary writer can presume to guess how far such work has gone or
what harvest it may be preparing.

Social and economic questions seem to be inseparably mingled with
international ones.  The solution in each case lies in an appeal to
that same spirit of service which can enter and inspire the human
heart.  The distrust, intractability and egotism of nations reflects
and is reflected by the distrust, intractability and egotism of the
individual owner and worker in the face of the common good. 
Exaggerations of possessiveness in the individual are parallel and of a
piece with the clutching greed of nations and emperors.  They are
products of the same instinctive tendencies, and the same ignorances
and traditions.  Internationalism is the socialism of nations.  No one
who has wrestled with these problems can feel that there yet exists a
sufficient depth and strength of psychological science and a
sufficiently planned-out educational method and organization for any
real and final solution of these riddles of human intercourse and
cooperation.  We are as incapable of planning a really effective peace
organization of the world to-day as were men in 1820 to plan an
electric railway system, but for all we know the thing is equally
practicable and may be as nearly at hand.

No man can go beyond his own knowledge, no thought can reach beyond
contemporary thought, and it is impossible for us to guess or foretell
how many generations of humanity may have to live in war and waste and
insecurity and misery before the dawn of the great peace to which all
history seems to be pointing, peace in the heart and peace in the
world, ends our night of wasteful and aimless living.  Our proposed
solutions are still vague and crude.  Passion and suspicion surround
them.  A great task of intellectual reconstruction is going on, it is
still incomplete, and our conceptions grow clearer and more
exact—slowly, rapidly, it is hard to tell which.  But as they grow
clearer they will gather power over the minds and imaginations of men. 
Their present lack of grip is due to their lack of assurance and exact
rightness. They are misunderstood because they are variously and
confusingly presented.  But with precision and certainty the new vision
of the world will gain compelling power.  It may presently gain power
very rapidly.  And a great work of educational reconstruction will
follow logically and necessarily upon that clearer understanding.




LX
THE EXPANSION OF THE UNITED STATES


The region of the world that displayed the most immediate and striking
results from the new inventions in transport was North America.
Politically the United States embodied, and its constitution
crystallized, the liberal ideas of the middle eighteenth century. It
dispensed with state-church or crown, it would have no titles, it
protected property very jealously as a method of freedom, and—the exact
practice varied at first in the different states—it gave nearly every
adult male citizen a vote. Its method of voting was barbarically crude,
and as a consequence its political life fell very soon under the
control of highly organized party machines, but that did not prevent
the newly emancipated population developing an energy, enterprise and
public spirit far beyond that of any other contemporary population.

Then came that acceleration of locomotion to which we have already
called attention.  It is a curious thing that America, which owes most
to this acceleration in locomotion, has felt it least.  The United
States have taken the railway, the river steamboat, the telegraph and
so forth as though they were a natural part of their growth.  They were
not. These things happened to come along just in time to save American
unity.  The United States of to-day were made first by the river
steamboat, and then by the railway.  Without these things, the present
United States, this vast continental nation, would have been altogether
impossible. The westward flow of population would have been far more
sluggish.  It might never have crossed the great central plains.  It
took nearly two hundred years for effective settlement to reach from
the coast to Missouri, much less than halfway across the continent. 
The first state established beyond the river was the steamboat state of
Missouri in 1821.  But the rest of the distance to the Pacific was done
in a few decades.

If we had the resources of the cinema it would be interesting to show a
map of North America year by year from 1600 onward, with little dots to
represent hundreds of people, each dot a hundred, and stars to
represent cities of a hundred thousand people.

For two hundred years the reader would see that stippling creeping
slowly along the coastal districts and navigable waters, spreading
still more gradually into Indiana, Kentucky and so forth.  Then
somewhere about 1810 would come a change. Things would get more lively
along the river courses.  The dots would be multiplying and spreading. 
That would be the steamboat.  The pioneer dots would be spreading soon
over Kansas and Nebraska from a number of jumping-off places along the
great rivers.

Then from about 1850 onward would come the black lines of the railways,
and after that the little black dots would not simply creep but run. 
They would appear now so rapidly, it would be almost as though they
were being put on by some sort of spraying machine.  And suddenly here
and then there would appear the first stars to indicate the first great
cities of a hundred thousand people.  First one or two and then a
multitude of cities—each like a knot in the growing net of the
railways.

The growth of the United States is a process that has no precedent in
the world’s history; it is a new kind of occurrence.  Such a community
could not have come into existence before, and if it had, without
railways it would certainly have dropped to pieces long before now. 
Without railways or telegraph it would be far easier to administer
California from Pekin than from Washington.  But this great population
of the United States of America has not only grown outrageously; it has
kept uniform.  Nay, it has become more uniform.  The man of San
Francisco is more like the man of New York to-day than the man of
Virginia was like the man of New England a century ago.  And the
process of assimilation goes on unimpeded.  The United States is being
woven by railway, by telegraph, more and more into one vast unity,
speaking, thinking and acting harmoniously with itself.  Soon aviation
will be helping in the work.

This great community of the United States is an altogether new thing in
history.  There have been great empires before with populations
exceeding 100 millions, but these were associations of divergent
peoples; there has never been one single people on this scale before. 
We want a new term for this new thing.  We call the United States a
country just as we call France or Holland a country.  But the two
things are as different as an automobile and a one-horse shay.  They
are the creations of different periods and different conditions; they
are going to work at a different pace and in an entirely different way.
 The United States in scale and possibility is halfway between a
European state and a United States of all the world.

But on the way to this present greatness and security the American
people passed through one phase of dire conflict. The river steamboats,
the railways, the telegraph, and their associate facilities, did not
come soon enough to avert a deepening conflict of interests and ideas
between the southern and northern states of the Union.  The former were
slave-holding states; the latter, states in which all men were free. 
The railways and steamboats at first did but bring into sharper
conflict an already established difference between the two sections of
the United States.  The increasing unification due to the new means of
transport made the question whether the southern spirit or the northern
should prevail an ever more urgent one.  There was little possibility
of compromise.  The northern spirit was free and individualistic; the
southern made for great estates and a conscious gentility ruling over a
dusky subject multitude.

Every new territory that was organized into a state as the tide of
population swept westward, every new incorporation into the fast
growing American system, became a field of conflict between the two
ideas, whether it should become a state of free citizens, or whether
the estate and slavery system should prevail.  From 1833 an American
anti-slavery society was not merely resisting the extension of the
institution but agitating the whole country for its complete abolition.
 The issue flamed up into open conflict over the admission of Texas to
the Union.  Texas had originally been a part of the republic of Mexico,
but it was largely colonized by Americans from the slave-holding
states, and it seceded from Mexico, established its independence in
1835, and was annexed to the United States in 1844.  Under the Mexican
law slavery had been forbidden in Texas, but now the South claimed
Texas for slavery and got it.

Meanwhile the development of ocean navigation was bringing a growing
swarm of immigrants from Europe to swell the spreading population of
the northern states, and the raising of Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota and
Oregon, all northern farm lands, to state level, gave the anti-slavery
North the possibility of predominance both in the Senate and the House
of Representatives.  The cotton- growing South, irritated by the
growing threat of the Abolitionist movement, and fearing this
predominance in Congress, began to talk of secession from the Union.
Southerners began to dream of annexations to the south of them in
Mexico and the West Indies, and of great slave state, detached from the
North and reaching to Panama.

The return of Abraham Lincoln as an anti-extension President in 1860
decided the South to split the Union.  South Carolina passed an
“ordinance of secession” and prepared for war.  Mississippi, Florida,
Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana and Texas joined her, and a convention met
at Montgomery in Alabama, elected Jefferson Davis president of the
“Confederated States” of America, and adopted a constitution
specifically upholding “the institution of negro slavery.”

ONE OF THE FIRST AMERICAN RIVER STEAMERS


Abraham Lincoln was, it chanced, a man entirely typical of the new
people that had grown up after the War of Independence.  His early
years had been spent as a drifting particle in the general westward
flow of the population.  He was born in Kentucky (1809), was taken to
Indiana as a boy and later on to Illinois.  Life was rough in the
backwoods of Indiana in those days; the house was a mere log cabin in
the wilderness, and his schooling was poor and casual.  But his mother
taught him to read early, and he became a voracious reader.  At
seventeen he was a big athletic youth, a great wrestler and runner.  He
worked for a time as clerk in a store, went into business as a
storekeeper with a drunken partner, and contracted debts that he did
not fully pay off for fifteen years.  In 1834, when he was still only
five and twenty, he was elected member of the House of Representatives
for the State of Illinois.  In Illinois particularly the question of
slavery flamed because the great leader of the party for the extension
of slavery in the national Congress was Senator Douglas of Illinois. 
Douglas was a man of great ability and prestige, and for some years
Lincoln fought against him by speech and pamphlet, rising steadily to
the position of his most formidable and finally victorious antagonist. 
Their culminating struggle was the presidential campaign of 1860, and
on the fourth of March, 1861, Lincoln was inaugurated President, with
the southern states already in active secession from the rule of the
federal government at Washington, and committing acts of war.

This civil war in America was fought by improvised armies that grew
steadily from a few score thousands to hundreds of thousands—until at
last the Federal forces exceeded a million men; it was fought over a
vast area between New Mexico and the eastern sea, Washington and
Richmond were the chief objectives.  It is beyond our scope here to
tell of the mounting energy of that epic struggle that rolled to and
fro across the hills and woods of Tennessee and Virginia and down the
Mississippi.  There was a terrible waste and killing of men.  Thrust
was followed by counter thrust; hope gave way to despondency, and
returned and was again disappointed. Sometimes Washington seemed within
the Confederate grasp; again the Federal armies were driving towards
Richmond.  The Confederates, outnumbered and far poorer in resources,
fought under a general of supreme ability, General Lee.  The
generalship of the Union was far inferior.  Generals were dismissed,
new generals appointed; until at last, under Sherman and Grant, came
victory over the ragged and depleted South.  In October, 1864, a
Federal army under Sherman broke through the Confederate left and
marched down from Tennessee through Georgia to the coast, right across
the Confederate country, and then turned up through the Carolinas,
coming in upon the rear of the Confederate armies.  Meanwhile Grant
held Lee before Richmond until Sherman closed on him.  On April 9th,
1865, Lee and his army surrendered at Appomattox Court House, and
within a month all the remaining secessionist armies had laid down
their arms and the Confederacy was at an end.


ABRAHAM LINCOLN
ABRAHAM LINCOLN


This four years’ struggle had meant an enormous physical and moral
strain for the people of the United States.  The principle of state
autonomy was very dear to many minds, and the North seemed in effect to
be forcing abolition upon the South.  In the border states brothers and
cousins, even fathers and sons, would take opposite sides and find
themselves in antagonistic armies.  The North felt its cause a
righteous one, but for great numbers of people it was not a full-bodied
and unchallenged righteousness.  But for Lincoln there was no doubt. 
He was a clear-minded man in the midst of much confusion.  He stood for
union; he stood for the wide peace of America.  He was opposed to
slavery, but slavery he held to be a secondary issue; his primary
purpose was that the United States should not be torn into two
contrasted and jarring fragments.

When in the opening stages of the war Congress and the Federal generals
embarked upon a precipitate emancipation, Lincoln opposed and mitigated
their enthusiasm.  He was for emancipation by stages and with
compensation.  It was only in January, 1865, that the situation had
ripened to a point when Congress could propose to abolish slavery for
ever by a constitutional amendment, and the war was already over before
this amendment was ratified by the states.

As the war dragged on through 1862 and 1863, the first passions and
enthusiasms waned, and America learnt all the phases of war weariness
and war disgust.  The President found himself with defeatists,
traitors, dismissed generals, tortuous party politicians, and a
doubting and fatigued people behind him and uninspired generals and
depressed troops before him; his chief consolation must have been that
Jefferson Davis at Richmond could be in little better case. The English
government misbehaved, and permitted the Confederate agents in England
to launch and man three swift privateer ships—the _Alabama_ is the best
remembered of them—which chased United States shipping from the seas. 
The French army in Mexico was trampling the Monroe Doctrine in the
dirt.  Came subtle proposals from Richmond to drop the war, leave the
issues of the war for subsequent discussion, and turn, Federal and
Confederate in alliance, upon the French in Mexico.  But Lincoln would
not listen to such proposals unless the supremacy of the Union was
maintained.  The Americans might do such things as one people but not
as two.

He held the United States together through long weary months of
reverses and ineffective effort, through black phases of division and
failing courage; and there is no record that he ever faltered from his
purpose.  There were times when there was nothing to be done, when he
sat in the White House silent and motionless, a grim monument of
resolve; times when he relaxed his mind by jesting and broad anecdotes.

He saw the Union triumphant.  He entered Richmond the day after its
surrender, and heard of Lee’s capitulation. He returned to Washington,
and on April 11th made his last public address.  His theme was
reconciliation and the reconstruction of loyal government in the
defeated states. On the evening of April 14th he went to Ford’s theatre
in Washington, and as he sat looking at the stage, he was shot in the
back of the head and killed by an actor named Booth who had some sort
of grievance against him, and who had crept into the box unobserved. 
But Lincoln’s work was done; the Union was saved.

At the beginning of the war there was no railway to the Pacific coast;
after it the railways spread like a swiftly growing plant until now
they have clutched and held and woven all the vast territory of the
United States into one indissoluble mental and material unity—the
greatest real community—until the common folk of China have learnt to
read—in the world.




LXI
THE RISE OF GERMANY TO PREDOMINANCE IN EUROPE


WE have told how after the convulsion of the French Revolution and the
Napoleonic adventure, Europe settled down again for a time to an
insecure peace and a sort of modernized revival of the political
conditions of fifty years before.  Until the middle of the century the
new facilities in the handling of steel and the railway and steamship
produced no marked political consequences.  But the social tension due
to the development of urban industrialism grew. France remained a
conspicuously uneasy country.  The revolution of 1830 was followed by
another in 1848.  Then Napoleon III, a nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte,
became first President, and then (in 1852) Emperor.

He set about rebuilding Paris, and changed it from a picturesque
seventeenth century insanitary city into the spacious Latinized city of
marble it is to-day.  He set about rebuilding France, and made it into
a brilliant-looking modernized imperialism.  He displayed a disposition
to revive that competitiveness of the Great Powers which had kept
Europe busy with futile wars during the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries.  The Tsar Nicholas I of Russia (1825- 1856) was also
becoming aggressive and pressing southward upon the Turkish Empire with
his eyes on Constantinople.

After the turn of the century Europe broke out into a fresh cycle of
wars.  They were chiefly “balance-of- power” and ascendancy wars. 
England, France and Sardinia assailed Russia in the Crimean war in
defence of Turkey; Prussia (with Italy as an ally) and Austria fought
for the leadership of Germany, France liberated North Italy from
Austria at the price of Savoy, and Italy gradually unified itself into
one kingdom.  Then Napoleon III was so ill advised as to attempt
adventures in Mexico, during the American Civil War; he set up an
Emperor Maximilian there and abandoned him hastily to his fate—he was
shot by the Mexicans—when the victorious Federal Government showed its
teeth.


Map of Europe, 1848-1871

In 1870 came a long-pending struggle for predominance in Europe between
France and Prussia.  Prussia had long foreseen and prepared for this
struggle, and France was rotten with financial corruption.  Her defeat
was swift and dramatic. The Germans invaded France in August, one great
French army under the Emperor capitulated at Sedan in September,
another surrendered in October at Metz, and in January 1871, Paris,
after a siege and bombardment, fell into German hands.  Peace was
signed at Frankfort surrendering the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine
to the Germans.  Germany, excluding Austria, was unified as an empire,
and the King of Prussia was added to the galaxy of European Cæsars, as
the German Emperor.

For the next forty-three years Germany was the leading power upon the
European continent.  There was a Russo-Turkish war in 1877-8, but
thereafter, except for certain readjustments in the Balkans, European
frontiers remained uneasily stable for thirty years.




LXII
THE NEW OVERSEAS EMPIRES OF STEAMSHIP AND RAILWAY


The end of the eighteenth century was a period of disrupting empires
and disillusioned expansionists. The long and tedious journey between
Britain and Spain and their colonies in America prevented any really
free coming and going between the home land and the daughter lands, and
so the colonies separated into new and distinct communities, with
distinctive ideas and interests and even modes of speech. As they grew
they strained more and more at the feeble and uncertain link of
shipping that had joined them. Weak trading-posts in the wilderness,
like those of France in Canada, or trading establishments in great
alien communities, like those of Britain in India, might well cling for
bare existence to the nation which gave them support and a reason for
their existence. That much and no more seemed to many thinkers in the
early part of the nineteenth century to be the limit set to overseas
rule. In 1820 the sketchy great European “empires” outside of Europe
that had figured so bravely in the maps of the middle eighteenth
century, had shrunken to very small dimensions. Only the Russian
sprawled as large as ever across Asia.

The British Empire in 1815 consisted of the thinly populated coastal
river and lake regions of Canada, and a great hinterland of wilderness
in which the only settlements as yet were the fur-trading stations of
the Hudson Bay Company, about a third of the Indian peninsula, under
the rule of the East India Company, the coast districts of the Cape of
Good Hope inhabited by blacks and rebellious-spirited Dutch settlers; a
few trading stations on the coast of West Africa, the rock of
Gibraltar, the island of Malta, Jamaica, a few minor slave-labour
possessions in the West Indies, British Guiana in South America, and,
on the other side of the world, two dumps for convicts at Botany Bay in
Australia and in Tasmania.  Spain retained Cuba and a few settlements
in the Philippine Islands.  Portugal had in Africa some vestiges of her
ancient claims.  Holland had various islands and possessions in the
East Indies and Dutch Guiana, and Denmark an island or so in the West
Indies.  France had one or two West Indian islands and French Guiana. 
This seemed to be as much as the European powers needed, or were likely
to acquire of the rest of the world.  Only the East India Company
showed any spirit of expansion.

While Europe was busy with the Napoleonic wars the East India Company,
under a succession of Governors-General, was playing much the same role
in India that had been played before by Turkoman and such-like invaders
from the north.  And after the peace of Vienna it went on, levying its
revenues, making wars, sending ambassadors to Asiatic powers, a quasi-
independent state, however, with a marked disposition to send wealth
westward.

We cannot tell here in any detail how the British Company made its way
to supremacy sometimes as the ally of this power, sometimes as that,
and finally as the conqueror of all.  Its power spread to Assam, Sind,
Oudh.  The map of India began to take on the outlines familiar to the
English schoolboy of to-day, a patchwork of native states embraced and
held together by the great provinces under direct British rule. . . .

In 1859, following upon a serious mutiny of the native troops in India,
this empire of the East India Company was annexed to the British Crown.
 By an Act entitled _An Act for the Better Government of India_, the
Governor-General became a Viceroy representing the Sovereign, and the
place of the Company was taken by a Secretary of State for India
responsible to the British Parliament.  In 1877, Lord Beaconsfield, to
complete the work, caused Queen Victoria to be proclaimed Empress of
India.

Upon these extraordinary lines India and Britain are linked at the
present time.  India is still the empire of the Great Mogul, but the
Great Mogul has been replaced by the “crowned republic” of Great
Britain.  India is an autocracy without an autocrat.  Its rule combines
the disadvantage of absolute monarchy with the impersonality and
irresponsibility of democratic officialdom.  The Indian with a
complaint to make has no visible monarch to go to; his Emperor is a
golden symbol; he must circulate pamphlets in England or inspire a
question in the British House of Commons.  The more occupied Parliament
is with British affairs, the less attention India will receive, and the
more she will be at the mercy of her small group of higher officials.

Apart from India, there was no great expansion of any European Empire
until the railways and the steamships were in effective action.  A
considerable school of political thinkers in Britain was disposed to
regard overseas possessions as a source of weakness to the kingdom. 
The Australian settlements developed slowly until in 1842 the discovery
of valuable copper mines, and in 1851 of gold, gave them a new
importance.  Improvements in transport were also making Australian wool
an increasingly marketable commodity in Europe.  Canada, too, was not
remarkably progressive until 1849; it was troubled by dissensions
between its French and British inhabitants, there were several serious
revolts, and it was only in 1867 that a new constitution creating a
Federal Dominion of Canada relieved its internal strains.  It was the
railway that altered the Canadian outlook.  It enabled Canada, just as
it enabled the United States, to expand westward, to market its corn
and other produce in Europe, and in spite of its swift and extensive
growth, to remain in language and sympathy and interests one community.
 The railway, the steamship and the telegraph cable were indeed
changing all the conditions of colonial development.

Before 1840, English settlements had already begun in New Zealand, and
a New Zealand Land Company had been formed to exploit the possibilities
of the island.  In 1840 New Zealand also was added to the colonial
possessions of the British Crown.

Canada, as we have noted, was the first of the British possessions to
respond richly to the new economic possibilities that the new methods
of transport were opening. Presently the republics of South America,
and particularly the Argentine Republic, began to feel in their cattle
trade and coffee growing the increased nearness of the European market.
 Hitherto the chief commodities that had attracted the European powers
into unsettled and barbaric regions had been gold or other metals,
spices, ivory, or slaves.  But in the latter quarter of the nineteenth
century the increase of the European populations was obliging their
governments to look abroad for staple foods; and the growth of
scientific industrialism was creating a demand for new raw materials,
fats and greases of every kind, rubber, and other hitherto disregarded
substances.  It was plain that Great Britain and Holland and Portugal
were reaping a great and growing commercial advantage from their very
considerable control of tropical and sub-tropical products.  After 1871
Germany, and presently France and later Italy, began to look for
unannexed raw-material areas, or for Oriental countries capable of
profitable modernization.

So began a fresh scramble all over the world, except in the American
region where the Monroe Doctrine now barred such adventures, for
politically unprotected lands.

Close to Europe was the continent of Africa, full of vaguely known
possibilities.  In 1850 it was a continent of black mystery; only Egypt
and the coast were known.  Here we have no space to tell the amazing
story of the explorers and adventurers who first pierced the African
darkness, and of the political agents, administrators, traders,
settlers and scientific men who followed in their track.  Wonderful
races of men like the pygmies, strange beasts like the okapi,
marvellous fruits and flowers and insects, terrible diseases,
astounding scenery of forest and mountain, enormous inland seas and
gigantic rivers and cascades were revealed; a whole new world.  Even
remains (at Zimbabwe) of some unrecorded and vanished civilization, the
southward enterprise of an early people, were discovered. Into this new
world came the Europeans, and found the rifle already there in the
hands of the Arab slave-traders, and negro life in disorder.


Map: The British Empire in 1815

By 1900, in half a century, all Africa was mapped, explored, estimated
and divided between the European powers.  Little heed was given to the
welfare of the natives in this scramble.  The Arab slaver was indeed
curbed rather than expelled, but the greed for rubber, which was a wild
product collected under compulsion by the natives in the Belgian Congo,
a greed exacerbated by the clash of inexperienced European
administrators with the native population, led to horrible atrocities. 
No European power has perfectly clean hands in this matter.

We cannot tell here in any detail how Great Britain got possession of
Egypt in 1883 and remained there in spite of the fact that Egypt was
technically a part of the Turkish Empire, nor how nearly this scramble
led to war between France and Great Britain in 1898, when a certain
Colonel Marchand, crossing Central Africa from the west coast, tried at
Fashoda to seize the Upper Nile.

Nor can we tell how the British Government first let the Boers, or
Dutch settlers, of the Orange River district and the Transvaal set up
independent republics in the inland parts of South Africa, and then
repented and annexed the Transvaal Republic in 1877; nor how the
Transvaal Boers fought for freedom and won it after the battle of
Majuba Hill (1881).  Majuba Hill was made to rankle in the memory of
the English people by a persistent press campaign.  A war with both
republics broke out in 1899, a three years’ war enormously costly to
the British people, which ended at last in the surrender of the two
republics.

Their period of subjugation was a brief one.  In 1907, after the
downfall of the imperialist government which had conquered them, the
Liberals took the South African problem in hand, and these former
republics became free and fairly willing associates with Cape Colony
and  Natal in a Confederation of all the states of South Africa as one
self- governing republic under the British Crown.

In a quarter of a century the partition of Africa was completed.  There
remained unannexed three comparatively small countries: Liberia, a
settlement of liberated negro slaves on the west coast; Morocco, under
a Moslem Sultan; and Abyssinia, a barbaric country, with an ancient and
peculiar form of Christianity, which had successfully maintained its
independence against Italy at the battle of Adowa in 1896.




LXIII
EUROPEAN AGGRESSION IN ASIA AND THE RISE OF JAPAN


It is difficult to believe that any large number of people really
accepted this headlong painting of the map of Africa in European
colours as a permanent new settlement of the worlds affairs, but it is
the duty of the historian to record that it was so accepted. There was
but a shallow historical background to the European mind in the
nineteenth century, and no habit of penetrating criticism. The quite
temporary advantages that the mechanical revolution in the west had
given the Europeans over the rest of the old world were regarded by
people, blankly ignorant of such events as the great Mongol conquests,
as evidences of a permanent and assured European leadership of mankind.
They had no sense of the transferability of science and its fruits.
They did not realize that Chinamen and Indians could carry on the work
of research as ably as Frenchmen or Englishmen. They believed that
there was some innate intellectual drive in the west, and some innate
indolence and conservatism in the east, that assured the Europeans a
world predominance for ever.

The consequence of this infatuation was that the various European
foreign offices set themselves not merely to scramble with the British
for the savage and undeveloped regions of the world’s surface, but also
to carve up the populous and civilized countries of Asia as though
these people also were no more than raw material for exploitation. The
inwardly precarious but outwardly splendid imperialism of the British
ruling class in India, and the extensive and profitable possessions of
the Dutch in the East Indies, filled the rival Great Powers with dreams
of similar glories in Persia, in the disintegrating Ottoman Empire, and
in Further India, China and Japan.

In 1898 Germany seized Kiau Chau in China.  Britain responded by
seizing Wei-hai-wei, and the next year the Russians took possession of
Port Arthur.  A flame of hatred for the Europeans swept through China. 
There were massacres of Europeans and Christian converts, and in 1900
an attack upon and siege of the European legations in Pekin.  A
combined force of Europeans made a punitive expedition to Pekin,
rescued the legations, and stole an enormous amount of valuable
property.  The Russians then seized Manchuria, and in 1904, the British
invaded Tibet....

But now a new Power appeared in the struggle of the Great Powers,
Japan.  Hitherto Japan has played but a small part in this history; her
secluded civilization has not contributed very largely to the general
shaping of human destinies; she has received much, but she has given
little.  The Japanese proper are of the Mongolian race.  Their
civilization, their writing and their literary and artistic traditions
are derived from the Chinese.  Their history is an interesting and
romantic one; they developed a feudal system and a system of chivalry
in the earlier centuries of the Christian era; their attacks upon Korea
and China are an Eastern equivalent of the English wars in France. 
Japan was first brought into contact with Europe in the sixteenth
century; in 1542 some Portuguese reached it in a Chinese junk, and in
1549 a Jesuit missionary, Francis Xavier, began his teaching there. 
For a time Japan welcomed European intercourse, and the Christian
missionaries made a great number of converts.  A certain William Adams
became the most trusted European adviser of the Japanese, and showed
them how to build big ships.  There were voyages in Japanese-built
ships to India and Peru.  Then arose complicated quarrels between the
Spanish Dominicans, the Portuguese Jesuits, and the English and Dutch
Protestants, each warning the Japanese against the political designs of
the others.  The Jesuits, in a phase of ascendancy, persecuted and
insulted the Buddhists with great acrimony.  In the end the Japanese
came to the conclusion that the Europeans were an intolerable nuisance,
and that Catholic Christianity in particular was a mere cloak for the
political dreams of the Pope and the Spanish monarchy—already in
possession of the Philippine Islands; there was a great persecution of
the Christians, and in 1638 Japan was absolutely closed to Europeans,
and remained closed for over 200 years.  During those two centuries the
Japanese were as completely cut off from the rest of the world as
though they lived upon another planet.  It was forbidden to build any
ship larger than a mere coasting boat. No Japanese could go abroad, and
no European enter the country.

For two centuries Japan remained outside the main current of history. 
She lived on in a state of picturesque feudalism in which about five
per cent of the population, the _samurai_, or fighting men, and the
nobles and their families, tyrannized without restraint over the rest
of the population.  Meanwhile the great world outside went on to wider
visions and new powers.  Strange shipping became more frequent, passing
the Japanese headlands; sometimes ships were wrecked and sailors
brought ashore.  Through the Dutch settlement in the island of Deshima,
their one link with the outer universe, came warnings that Japan was
not keeping pace with the power of the Western world.  In 1837 a ship
sailed into Yedo Bay flying a strange flag of stripes and stars, and
carrying some Japanese sailors she had picked up far adrift in the
Pacific.  She was driven off by cannon shot.  This flag presently
reappeared on other ships.  One in 1849 came to demand the liberation
of eighteen shipwrecked American sailors.  Then in 1853 came four
American warships under Commodore Perry, and refused to be driven away.
 He lay at anchor in forbidden waters, and sent messages to the two
rulers who at that time shared the control of Japan.  In 1854 he
returned with ten ships, amazing ships propelled by steam, and equipped
with big guns, and he made proposals for trade and intercourse that the
Japanese had no power to resist.  He landed with a guard of 500 men to
sign the treaty. Incredulous crowds watched this visitation from the
outer world, marching through the streets.

Russia, Holland and Britain followed in the wake of America. A great
nobleman whose estates commanded the Straits of Shimonoseki saw fit to
fire on foreign vessels, and a bombardment by a fleet of British,
French, Dutch and American warships destroyed his batteries and
scattered his swordsmen. Finally an allied squadron (1865), at anchor
off Kioto, imposed a ratification of the treaties which opened Japan to
the world.

The humiliation of the Japanese by these events was intense. With
astonishing energy and intelligence they set themselves to bring their
culture and organization to the level of the European Powers.  Never in
all the history of mankind did a nation make such a stride as Japan
then did.  In 1866 she was a medieval people, a fantastic caricature of
the extremest romantic feudalism; in 1899 hers was a completely
Westernized people, on a level with the most advanced European Powers.
She completely dispelled the persuasion that Asia was in some
irrevocable way hopelessly behind Europe.  She made all European
progress seem sluggish by comparison.

We cannot tell here in any detail of Japan’s war with China in 1894-95.
 It demonstrated the extent of her Westernization.  She had an
efficient Westernized army and a small but sound fleet.  But the
significance of her renascence, though it was appreciated by Britain
and the United States, who were already treating her as if she were a
European state, was not understood by the other Great Powers engaged in
the pursuit of new Indias in Asia.  Russia was pushing down through
Manchuria to Korea.  France was already established far to the south in
Tonkin and Annam, Germany was prowling hungrily on the look-out for
some settlement.  The three Powers combined to prevent Japan reaping
any fruits from the Chinese war.  She was exhausted by the struggle,
and they threatened her with war.

Japan submitted for a time and gathered her forces.  Within ten years
she was ready for a struggle with Russia, which marks an epoch in the
history of Asia, the close of the period of European arrogance.  The
Russian people were, of course, innocent and ignorant of this trouble
that was being made for them halfway round the world, and the wiser
Russian statesmen were against these foolish thrusts; but a gang of
financial adventurers, including the Grand Dukes, his cousins,
surrounded the Tsar.  They had gambled deeply in the prospective
looting of Manchuria and China, and they would suffer no withdrawal. 
So there began a transportation of great armies of Japanese soldiers
across the sea to Port Arthur and Korea, and the sending of endless
trainloads of Russian peasants along the Siberian railway to die in
those distant battlefields.

The Russians, badly led and dishonestly provided, were beaten on sea
and land alike.  The Russian Baltic Fleet sailed round Africa to be
utterly destroyed in the Straits of Tshushima. A revolutionary movement
among the common people of Russia, infuriated by this remote and
reasonless slaughter, obliged the Tsar to end the war (1905); he
returned the southern half of Saghalien, which had been seized by
Russia in 1875, evacuated Manchuria, resigned Korea to Japan.  The
European invasion of Asia was coming to an end and the retraction of
Europe’s tentacles was beginning.




LXIV
THE BRITISH EMPIRE IN 1914


We may note here briefly the varied nature of the constituents of the
British Empire in 1914 which the steamship and railway had brought
together. It was and is a quite unique political combination; nothing
of the sort has ever existed before.

First and central to the whole system was the “crowned republic” of the
United British Kingdom, including (against the will of a considerable
part of the Irish people) Ireland.  The majority of the British
Parliament, made up of the three united parliaments of England and
Wales, Scotland and Ireland, determines the headship, the quality and
policy of the ministry, and determines it largely on considerations
arising out of British domestic politics.  It is this ministry which is
the effective supreme government, with powers of peace and war, over
all the rest of the empire.

Next in order of political importance to the British States were the
“crowned republics” of Australia, Canada, Newfoundland (the oldest
British possession, 1583), New Zealand and South Africa, all
practically independent and self-governing states in alliance with
Great Britain, but each with a representative of the Crown appointed by
the Government in office;

Next the Indian Empire, an extension of the Empire of the Great Mogul
with its dependent and “protected” states reaching now from Beluchistan
to Burma, and including Aden, in all of which empire the British Crown
and the India Office (under Parliamentary control) played the role of
the original Turkoman dynasty;

Then the ambiguous possession of Egypt, still nominally a part of the
Turkish Empire and still retaining its own monarch, the Khedive, but
under almost despotic British official rule;


Map: OVERSEAS EMPIRES of EUROPEAN POWERS, January 1914

Then the still more ambiguous “Anglo-Egyptian” Sudan province, occupied
and administered jointly by the British and by the (British controlled)
Egyptian Government;

Then a number of partially self-governing communities, some British in
origin and some not, with elected legislatures and an appointed
executive, such as Malta, Jamaica, the Bahamas and Bermuda;

Then the Crown colonies, in which the rule of the British Home
Government (through the Colonial Office) verged on autocracy, as in
Ceylon, Trinidad and Fiji (where there was an appointed council), and
Gibraltar and St. Helena (where there was a governor);


GIBRALTAR

Then great areas of (chiefly) tropical lands, raw-product areas, with
politically weak and under-civilized native communities which were
nominally protectorates, and administered either by a High Commissioner
set over native chiefs (as in Basutoland) or over a chartered company
(as in Rhodesia).  In some cases the Foreign Office, in some cases the
Colonial Office, and in some cases the India Office, has been concerned
in acquiring the possessions that fell into this last and least
definite class of all, but for the most part the Colonial Office was
now responsible for them.

It will be manifest, therefore, that no single office and no single
brain had ever comprehended the British Empire as a whole.  It was a
mixture of growths and accumulations entirely different from anything
that has ever been called an empire before.  It guaranteed a wide peace
and security; that is why it was endured and sustained by many men of
the “subject” races—in spite of official tyrannies and insufficiencies,
and of much negligence on the part of the “home” public. Like the
Athenian Empire, it was an overseas empire; its ways were sea ways, and
its common link was the British Navy. Like all empires, its cohesion
was dependent physically upon a method of communication; the
development of seamanship, ship-building and steamships between the
sixteenth and nineteenth centuries had made it a possible and
convenient Pax—the “Pax Britannica,” and fresh developments of air or
swift land transport might at any time make it inconvenient.

LXV
THE AGE OF ARMAMENT IN EUROPE, AND THE GREAT WAR OF 1914-18


The progress in material science that created this vast
steamboat-and-railway republic of America and spread this precarious
British steamship empire over the world, produced quite other effects
upon the congested nations upon the continent of Europe. They found
themselves confined within boundaries fixed during the
horse-and-high-road period of human life, and their expansion overseas
had been very largely anticipated by Great Britain. Only Russia had any
freedom to expand eastward; and she drove a great railway across
Siberia until she entangled herself in a conflict with Japan, and
pushed south-eastwardly towards the borders of Persia and India to the
annoyance of Britain. The rest of the European Powers were in a state
of intensifying congestion. In order to realize the full possibilities
of the new apparatus of human life they had to rearrange their affairs
upon a broader basis, either by some sort of voluntary union or by a
union imposed upon them by some predominant power. The tendency of
modern thought was in the direction of the former alternative, but all
the force of political tradition drove Europe towards the latter.

The downfall of the “empire” of Napoleon III, the establishment of the
new German Empire, pointed men’s hopes and fears towards the idea of a
Europe consolidated under German auspices.  For thirty-six years of
uneasy peace the polities of Europe centred upon that possibility.
France, the steadfast rival of Germany for European ascendancy since
the division of the empire of Charlemagne, sought to correct her own
weakness by a close alliance with Russia, and Germany linked herself
closely with the Austrian Empire (it had ceased to be the Holy Roman
Empire in the days of Napoleon I) and less successfully with the new
kingdom of Italy.  At first Great Britain stood as usual half in and
half out of continental affairs.  But she was gradually forced into a
close association with the Franco-Russian group by the aggressive
development of a great German navy.  The grandiose imagination of the
Emperor William II (1888-1918) thrust Germany into premature overseas
enterprise that ultimately brought not only Great Britain but Japan and
the United States into the circle of her enemies.

All these nations armed.  Year after year the proportion of national
production devoted to the making of guns, equipment, battleships and
the like, increased. Year after year the balance of things seemed
trembling towards war, and then war would be averted.  At last it came.
Germany and Austria struck at France and Russia and Serbia; the German
armies marching through Belgium, Britain immediately came into the war
on the side of Belgium, bringing in Japan as her ally, and very soon
Turkey followed on the German side.  Italy entered the war against
Austria in 1915, and Bulgaria joined the Central Powers in the October
of that year.  In 1916 Rumania, and in 1917 the United States and China
were forced into war against Germany.  It is not within the scope of
this history to define the exact share of blame for this vast
catastrophe.  The more interesting question is not why the Great War
was begun but why the Great War was not anticipated and prevented.  It
is a far graver thing for mankind that scores of millions of people
were too “patriotic,” stupid, or apathetic to prevent this disaster by
a movement towards European unity upon frank and generous lines, than
that a small number of people may have been active in bringing it
about.

It is impossible within the space at our command here to trace the
intricate details of the war.  Within a few months it became apparent
that the progress of modern technical science had changed the nature of
warfare very profoundly.  Physical science gives power, power over
steel, over distance, over disease; whether that power is used well or
ill depends upon the moral and political intelligence of the world. 
The governments of Europe, inspired by antiquated policies of hate and
suspicion, found themselves with unexampled powers both of destruction
and resistance in their hands.  The war became a consuming fire round
and about the world, causing losses both to victors and vanquished out
of all proportion to the issues involved.  The first phase of the war
was a tremendous rush of the Germans upon Paris and an invasion of East
Prussia by the Russians.  Both attacks were held and turned.  Then the
power of the defensive developed; there was a rapid elaboration of
trench warfare until for a time the opposing armies lay entrenched in
long lines right across Europe, unable to make any advance without
enormous losses.  The armies were millions strong, and behind them
entire populations were organized for the supply of food and munitions
to the front.  Then was a cessation of nearly every sort of productive
activity except such as contributed to military operations.  All the
able-bodied manhood of Europe was drawn into the armies or navies or
into the improvised factories that served them.  There was an enormous
replacement of men by women in industry. Probably more than half the
people in the belligerent countries of Europe changed their employment
altogether during this stupendous struggle.  They were socially
uprooted and transplanted.  Education and normal scientific work were
restricted or diverted to immediate military ends, and the distribution
of news was crippled and corrupted by military control and “propaganda”
activities.

The phase of military deadlock passed slowly into one of aggression
upon the combatant populations behind the fronts by the destruction of
food supplies and by attacks through the air.  And also there was a
steady improvement in the size and range of the guns employed and of
such ingenious devices as poison-gas shells and the small mobile forts
known as tanks, to break down the resistance of troops in the trenches.
 The air offensive was the most revolutionary of all the new methods. 
It carried warfare from two dimensions into three.  Hitherto in the
history of mankind war had gone on only where the armies marched and
met.  Now it went on everywhere.  First the Zeppelin and then the
bombing aeroplane carried war over and past the front to an ever-
increasing area of civilian activities beyond.  The old distinction
maintained in civilized warfare between the civilian and combatant
population disappeared.  Everyone who grew food, or who sewed a
garment, everyone who felled a tree or repaired a house, every railway
station and every warehouse was held to be fair game for destruction. 
The air offensive increased in range and terror with every month in the
war.  At last great areas of Europe were in a state of siege and
subject to nightly raids.  Such exposed cities as London and Paris
passed sleepless night after sleepless night while the bombs burst, the
anti-aircraft guns maintained an intolerable racket, and the fire
engines and ambulances rattled headlong through the darkened and
deserted streets. The effects upon the minds and health of old people
and of young children were particularly distressing and destructive.

Pestilence, that old follower of warfare, did not arrive until the very
end of the fighting in 1918.  For four years medical science staved off
any general epidemic; then came a great outbreak of influenza about the
world which destroyed many millions of people.  Famine also was staved
off for some time.  By the beginning of 1918 however most of Europe was
in a state of mitigated and regulated famine.  The production of food
throughout the world had fallen very greatly through the calling off of
peasant mankind to the fronts, and the distribution of such food as was
produced was impeded by the havoc wrought by the submarine, by the
rupture of customary routes through the closing of frontiers, and by
the disorganization of the transport system of the world. The various
governments took possession of the dwindling food supplies, and, with
more or less success, rationed their populations.  By the fourth year
the whole world was suffering from shortages of clothing and housing
and of most of the normal gear of life as well as of food.  Business
and economic life were profoundly disorganized.  Every-one was worried,
and most people were leading lives of unwonted discomfort.

The actual warfare ceased in November, 1918.  After a supreme effort in
the spring of 1918 that almost carried the Germans to Paris, the
Central Powers collapsed.  They had come to an end of their spirit and
resources.




LXVI
THE REVOLUTION AND FAMINE IN RUSSIA


But a good year and more before the collapse of the Central Powers the
half oriental monarchy of Russia, which had professed to be the
continuation of the Byzantine Empire, had collapsed. The Tsardom had
been showing signs of profound rottenness for some years before the
war; the court was under the sway of a fantastic religious impostor,
Rasputin, and the public administration, civil and military, was in a
state of extreme inefficiency and corruption. At the outset of the war
there was a great flare of patriotic enthusiasm in Russia. A vast
conscript army was called up, for which there was neither adequate
military equipment nor a proper supply of competent officers, and this
great host, ill supplied and badly handled, was hurled against the
German and Austrian frontiers.

There can be no doubt that the early appearance of Russian armies in
East Prussia in September, 1914, diverted the energies and attention of
the Germans from their first victorious drive upon Paris.  The
sufferings and deaths of scores of thousands of ill-led Russian
peasants saved France from complete overthrow in that momentous opening
campaign, and made all western Europe the debtors of that great and
tragic people.  But the strain of the war upon this sprawling,
ill-organized empire was too heavy for its strength.  The Russian
common soldiers were sent into battle without guns to support them,
without even rifle ammunition; they were wasted by their officers and
generals in a delirium of militarist enthusiasm.  For a time they
seemed to be suffering mutely as the beasts suffer; but there is a
limit to the endurance even of the most ignorant.  A profound disgust
for Tsardom was creeping through these armies of betrayed and wasted
men.  From the close of 1915 onward Russia was a source of deepening
anxiety to her Western Allies.  Throughout 1916 she remained largely on
the defensive, and there were rumours of a separate peace with Germany.

On December 29th, 1916, the monk Rasputin was murdered at a dinner
party in Petrograd, and a belated attempt was made to put the Tsardom
in order.  By March things were moving rapidly; food riots in Petrograd
developed into a revolutionary insurrection; there was an attempted
suppression of the Duma, the representative body, there were attempted
arrests of liberal leaders, the formation of a provisional government
under Prince Lvoff, and an abdication (March 15th) by the Tsar.  For a
time it seemed that a moderate and controlled revolution might be
possible—perhaps under a new Tsar.  Then it became evident that the
destruction of popular confidence in Russia had gone too far for any
such adjustments. The Russian people were sick to death of the old
order of things in Europe, of Tsars and wars and of Great Powers; it
wanted relief, and that speedily, from unendurable miseries.  The
Allies had no understanding of Russian realities; their diplomatists
were ignorant of Russian, genteel persons with their attention directed
to the Russian Court rather than to Russia, they blundered steadily
with the new situation.  There was little goodwill among these
diplomatists for republicanism, and a manifest disposition to embarrass
the new government as much as possible.  At the head of the Russian
republican government was an eloquent and picturesque leader, Kerensky,
who found himself assailed by the forces of a profounder revolutionary
movement, the “social revolution,” at home and cold-shouldered by the
Allied governments abroad.  His Allies would neither let him give the
Russian peasants the land for which they craved nor peace beyond their
frontiers.  The French and the British press pestered their exhausted
ally for a fresh offensive, but when presently the Germans made a
strong attack by sea and land upon Riga, the British Admiralty quailed
before the prospect of a Baltic expedition in relief.  The new Russian
Republic had to fight unsupported.  In spite of their naval
predominance and the bitter protests of the great English admiral, Lord
Fisher (1841-1920), it is to be noted that the British and their
Allies, except for some submarine attacks, left the Germans the
complete mastery of the Baltic throughout the war.

The Russian masses, however, were resolute to end the war.  At any
cost.  There had come into existence in Petrograd a body representing
the workers and common soldiers, the Soviet, and this body clamoured
for an international conference of socialists at Stockholm.  Food riots
were occurring in Berlin at this time, war weariness in Austria and
Germany was profound, and there can be little doubt, in the light of
subsequent events, that such a conference would have precipitated a
reasonable peace on democratic lines in 1917 and a German revolution. 
Kerensky implored his Western allies to allow this conference to take
place, but, fearful of a worldwide outbreak of socialism and
republicanism, they refused, in spite of the favourable response of a
small majority of the British Labour Party.  Without either moral or
physical help from the Allies, the unhappy “moderate” Russian Republic
still fought on and made a last desperate offensive effort in July.  It
failed after some preliminary successes, and there came another great
slaughtering of Russians.

The limit of Russian endurance was reached.  Mutinies broke out in the
Russian armies, and particularly upon the northern front, and on
November 7th, 1917, Kerensky’s government was overthrown and power was
seized by the Soviets, dominated by the Bolshevik socialists under
Lenin, and pledged to make peace regardless of the Western powers.  On
March 2nd, 1918, a separate peace between Russia and Germany was signed
at Brest-Litovsk.

It speedily became evident that these Bolshevik socialists were men of
a very different quality from the rhetorical constitutionalists and
revolutionaries of the Kerensky phase.  They were fanatical Marxist
communists.  They believed that their accession to power in Russia was
only the opening of a world-wide social revolution, and they set about
changing the social and economic order with the thoroughness of perfect
faith and absolute inexperience.  The western European and the American
governments were themselves much too ill-informed and incapable to
guide or help this extraordinary experiment, and the press set itself
to discredit and the ruling classes to wreck these usurpers upon any
terms and at any cost to themselves or to Russia.  A propaganda of
abominable and disgusting inventions went on unchecked in the press of
the world; the Bolshevik leaders were represented as incredible
monsters glutted with blood and plunder and living lives of sensuality
before which the realities of the Tsarist court during the Rasputin
regime paled to a white purity.  Expeditions were launched at the
exhausted country, insurgents and raiders were encouraged, armed and
subsidized, and no method of attack was too mean or too monstrous for
the frightened enemies of the Bolshevik regime.  In 1919, the Russian
Bolsheviks, ruling a country already exhausted and disorganized by five
years of intensive warfare, were fighting a British Expedition at
Archangel, Japanese invaders in Eastern Siberia, Roumanians with French
and Greek contingents in the south, the Russian Admiral Koltchak in
Siberia and General Deniken, supported by the French fleet, in the
Crimea.  In July of that year an Esthonian army, under General
Yudenitch, almost got to Petersburg.  In 1920 the Poles, incited by the
French, made a new attack on Russia; and a new reactionary raider,
General Wrangel, took over the task of General Deniken in invading and
devastating his own country.  In March, 1921, the sailors at Cronstadt
revolted.  The Russian Government under its president, Lenin, survived
all these various attacks.  It showed an amazing tenacity, and the
common people of Russia sustained it unswervingly under conditions of
extreme hardship.  By the end of 1921 both Britain and Italy had made a
sort of recognition of the communist rule.

But if the Bolshevik Government was successful in its struggle against
foreign intervention and internal revolt, it was far less happy in its
attempts to set up a new social order based upon communist ideas in
Russia.  The Russian peasant is a small land-hungry proprietor, as far
from communism in his thoughts and methods as a whale is from flying;
the revolution gave him the land of the great landowners but could not
make him grow food for anything but negotiable money, and the
revolution, among other things, had practically destroyed the value of
money. Agricultural production, already greatly disordered by the
collapse of the railways through war-strain, shrank to a mere
cultivation of food by the peasants for their own consumption.  The
towns starved.  Hasty and ill-planned attempts to make over industrial
production in accordance with communist ideas were equally
unsuccessful.  By 1920 Russia presented the unprecedented spectacle of
a modern civilization in complete collapse.  Railways were rusting and
passing out of use, towns were falling into ruin, everywhere there was
an immense mortality.  Yet the country still fought with its enemies at
its gates.  In 1921 came a drought and a great famine among the peasant
cultivators in the war-devastated south-east provinces.  Millions of
people starved.

But the question of the distresses and the possible recuperation of
Russia brings us too close to current controversies to be discussed
here.




LXVII
THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL RECONSTRUCTION OF THE WORLD


The scheme and scale upon which this History is planned do not permit
us to enter into the complicated and acrimonious disputes that centre
about the treaties, and particularly of the treaty of Versailles, which
concluded the Great War. We are beginning to realize that that
conflict, terrible and enormous as it was, ended nothing, began nothing
and settled nothing. It killed millions of people; it wasted and
impoverished the world. It smashed Russia altogether. It was at best an
acute and frightful reminder that we were living foolishly and
confusedly without much plan or foresight in a dangerous and
unsympathetic universe. The crudely organized egotisms and passions of
national and imperial greed that carried mankind into that tragedy,
emerged from it sufficiently unimpaired to make some other similar
disaster highly probable so soon as the world has a little recovered
from its war exhaustion and fatigue. Wars and revolutions make nothing;
their utmost service to mankind is that, in a very rough and painful
way, they destroy superannuated and obstructive things. The great war
lifted the threat of German imperialism from Europe, and shattered the
imperialism of Russia. It cleared away a number of monarchies. But a
multitude of flags still waves in Europe, the frontiers still
exasperate, great armies accumulate fresh stores of equipment.

The Peace Conference at Versailles was a gathering very ill adapted to
do more than carry out the conflicts and defeats of the war to their
logical conclusions.  The Germans, Austrians, Turks and Bulgarians were
permitted no share in its deliberations; they were only to accept the
decisions it dictated to them.  From the point of view of human welfare
the choice of the place of meeting was particularly unfortunate.  It
was at Versailles in 1871 that, with every circumstance of triumphant
vulgarity, the new German Empire had been proclaimed.  The suggestion
of a melodramatic reversal of that scene, in the same Hall of Mirrors,
was overpowering.

Whatever generosities had appeared in the opening phases of the Great
War had long been exhausted.  The populations of the victorious
countries were acutely aware of their own losses and sufferings, and
entirely regardless of the fact that the defeated had paid in the like
manner.  The war had arisen as a natural and inevitable consequence of
the competitive nationalisms of Europe and the absence of any Federal
adjustment of these competitive forces; war is the necessary logical
consummation of independent sovereign nationalities living in too small
an area with too powerful an armament; and if the great war had not
come in the form it did it would have come in some similar form—just as
it will certainly return upon a still more disastrous scale in twenty
or thirty years’ time if no political unification anticipates and
prevents it.  States organized for war will make wars as surely as hens
will lay eggs, but the feeling of these distressed and war-worn
countries disregarded this fact, and the whole of the defeated peoples
were treated as morally and materially responsible for all the damage,
as they would no doubt have treated the victor peoples had the issue of
war been different.  The French and English thought the Germans were to
blame, the Germans thought the Russians, French and English were to
blame, and only an intelligent minority thought that there was anything
to blame in the fragmentary political constitution of Europe.  The
treaty of Versailles was intended to be exemplary and vindictive; it
provided tremendous penalties for the vanquished; it sought to provide
compensations for the wounded and suffering victors by imposing
enormous debts upon nations already bankrupt, and its attempts to
reconstitute international relations by the establishment of a League
of Nations against war were manifestly insincere and inadequate.

So far as Europe was concerned it is doubtful if there would have been
any attempt whatever to organize international relations for a
permanent peace.  The proposal of the League of Nations was brought
into practical politics by the President of the United States of
America, President Wilson.  Its chief support was in America.  So far
the United States, this new modern state, had developed no distinctive
ideas of international relationship beyond the Monroe Doctrine, which
protected the new world from European interference. Now suddenly it was
called upon for its mental contribution to the vast problem of the
time.  It had none.  The natural disposition of the American people was
towards a permanent world peace.  With this however was linked a strong
traditional distrust of old-world polities and a habit of isolation
from old-world entanglements. The Americans had hardly begun to think
out an American solution of world problems when the submarine campaign
of the Germans dragged them into the war on the side of the anti-German
allies. President Wilson’s scheme of a League of Nations was an attempt
at short notice to create a distinctively American world project.  It
was a sketchy, inadequate and dangerous scheme.  In Europe however it
was taken as a matured American point of view. The generality of
mankind in 1918-19 was intensely weary of war and anxious at almost any
sacrifice to erect barriers against its recurrence, but there was not a
single government in the old world willing to waive one iota of its
sovereign independence to attain any such end.  The public utterances
of President Wilson leading up to the project of a World League of
Nations seemed for a time to appeal right over the heads of the
governments to the peoples of the world; they were taken as expressing
the ripe intentions of America, and the response was enormous. 
Unhappily President Wilson had to deal with governments and not with
peoples; he was a man capable of tremendous flashes of vision and yet
when put to the test egotistical and limited, and the great wave of
enthusiasm he evoked passed and was wasted.

Says Dr. Dillon in his book, _The Peace Conference:_ “Europe, when the
President touched its shores, was as clay ready for the creative
potter.  Never before were the nations so eager to follow a Moses who
would take them to the long-promised land where wars are prohibited and
blockades unknown.  And to their thinking he was just that great
leader.  In France men bowed down before him with awe and affection. 
Labour leaders in Paris told me that they shed tears of joy in his
presence, and that their comrades would go through fire and water to
help him to realize his noble schemes.  To the working classes in Italy
his name was a heavenly clarion at the sound of which the earth would
be renewed. The Germans regarded him and his doctrine as their
sheet-anchor of safety.  The fearless Herr Muehlon said: ‘If President
Wilson were to address the Germans and pronounce a severe sentence upon
them, they would accept it with resignation and without a murmur and
set to work at once.’  In German-Austria his fame was that of a
saviour, and the mere mention of his name brought balm to the suffering
and surcease of sorrow to the afflicted ... .”

Such were the overpowering expectations that President Wilson raised.
How completely he disappointed them and how weak and futile was the
League of Nations he made is too long and too distressful a story to
tell here. He exaggerated in his person our common human tragedy, he
was so very great in his dreams and so incapable in his performance.
America dissented from the acts of its President and would not join the
League Europe accepted from him. There was a slow realization on the
part of the American people that it had been rushed into something for
which it was totally unprepared. There was a corresponding realization
on the part of Europe that America had nothing ready to give to the old
world in its extremity. Born prematurely and crippled at its birth,
that League has become indeed, with its elaborate and unpractical
constitution and its manifest limitations of power, a serious obstacle
in the way of any effective reorganization of international
relationships. The problem would be a clearer one if the League did not
yet exist. Yet that world-wide blaze of enthusiasm that first welcomed
the project, that readiness of men everywhere round and about the
earth, of men, that is, as distinguished from governments, for a world
control of war, is a thing to be recorded with emphasis in any history.
Behind the short-sighted governments that divide and mismanage human
affairs, a real force for world unity and world order exists and grows.

From 1918 onward the world entered upon an age of conferences.  Of
these the Conference at Washington called by President Harding (1921)
has been the most successful and suggestive.  Notable, too, is the
Genoa Conference (1922) for the appearance of German and Russian
delegates at its deliberations.  We will not discuss this long
procession of conferences and tentatives in any detail.  It becomes
more and more clearly manifest that a huge work of reconstruction has
to be done by mankind if a crescendo of such convulsions and world
massacres as that of the great war is to be averted.  No such hasty
improvisation as the League of Nations, no patched-up system of
Conferences between this group of states and that, which change nothing
with an air of settling everything, will meet the complex political
needs of the new age that lies before us.  A systematic development and
a systematic application of the sciences of human relationship, of
personal and group psychology, of financial and economic science and of
education, sciences still only in their infancy, is required.  Narrow
and obsolete, dead and dying moral and political ideas have to be
replaced by a clearer and a simpler conception of the common origins
and destinies of our kind.

But if the dangers, confusions and disasters that crowd upon man in
these days are enormous beyond any experience of the past, it is
because science has brought him such powers as he never had before. And
the scientific method of fearless thought, exhaustively lucid
statement, and exhaustively criticized planning, which has given him
these as yet uncontrollable powers, gives him also the hope of
controlling these powers.  Man is still only adolescent.  His troubles
are not the troubles of senility and exhaustion but of increasing and
still undisciplined strength.  When we look at all history as one
process, as we have been doing in this book, when we see the steadfast
upward struggle of life towards vision and control, then we see in
their true proportions the hopes and dangers of the present time.  As
yet we are hardly in the earliest dawn of human greatness.  But in the
beauty of flower and sunset, in the happy and perfect movement of young
animals and in the delight of ten thousand various landscapes, we have
some intimations of what life can do for us, and in some few works of
plastic and pictorial art, in some great music, in a few noble
buildings and happy gardens, we have an intimation of what the human
will can do with material possibilities.  We have dreams; we have at
present undisciplined but ever increasing power.  Can we doubt that
presently our race will more than realize our boldest imaginations,
that it will achieve unity and peace, that it will live, the children
of our blood and lives will live, in a world made more splendid and
lovely than any palace or garden that we know, going on from strength
to strength in an ever widening circle of adventure and achievement?
What man has done, the little triumphs of his present state, and all
this history we have told, form but the prelude to the things that man
has got to do.

CHRONOLOGICAL TABLE

About the year 1000 B.C. the Aryan peoples were establishing themselves
in the peninsulas of Spain, Italy and the Balkans, and they were
established in North India; Cnossos was already destroyed and the
spacious times of Egypt, of Thothmes III, Amenophis III and Rameses II
were three or four centuries away. Weak monarchs of the XXIst Dynasty
were ruling in the Nile Valley. Israel was united under her early
kings; Saul or David or possibly even Solomon may have been reigning.
Sargon I (2750 B.C.) of the Akkadian Sumerian Empire was a remote
memory in Babylonian history, more remote than is Constantine the Great
from the world of the present day. Hammurabi had been dead a thousand
years. The Assyrians were already dominating the less military
Babylonians. In 1100 B.C. Tiglath Pileser I had taken Babylon. But
there was no permanent conquest; Assyria and Babylonia were still
separate empires. In China the new Chow dynasty was flourishing.
Stonehenge in England was already some hundreds of years old.

The next two centuries saw a renascence of Egypt under the XXIInd
Dynasty, the splitting up of the brief little Hebrew kingdom of
Solomon, the spreading of the Greeks in the Balkans, South Italy and
Asia Minor, and the days of Etruscan predominance in Central Italy.  We
begin our list of ascertainable dates with
