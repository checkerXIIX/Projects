Adjust thread number and problem sizes in .cpp files

Number of threads:
#define NUM_THREADS 8

Problem sizes:
vector<int> test_cases = {...}

execute files with the arguments:
./filename num_test_runs output_filename

Output files get stored in data directory

The bash files can be used to execute multiple tests at the same time.
